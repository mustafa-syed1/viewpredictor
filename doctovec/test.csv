0,"KARACHI: Karachi Police late Saturday released pictures of the suspect involved in knife attacks on women in the city's Gulistan-e-Jauhar area, with officials saying that the lone wolf attacker ""appears to be a lean man in his 20s.""The attacks, believed to have been carried out by the same suspect, have so far wounded at least nine women near Rabia City and Jauhar Chowrangi areas of the city.The latest attack came in wee hours of Saturday, when a woman was stabbed while descending from a rickshaw near Mosamiat. She then went to a nearby hospital in the same rickshaw for treatment.Police released pictures of the suspect late Saturday, in which the lone wolf attacker is seen riding a motorbike, moments before attacking one of the victims.""The suspect appears to be a lean man aged between 20-29 years,"" said Sultan Khawaja, deputy inspector general (DIG) of Karachi's district East. ""He appears to be 5 feet 7-9 inches tall.""Khawaja said that anyone helping or providing information leading to the arrest of the suspect would be given Rs0.5 million.He said that any information on the suspect could be given on mobile phone no. 0300-3552256."
1,"BRUSSELS: Google will treat its own shopping service the same as rivals when they bid for ads at the top of a search page, the company said on Wednesday, as it seeks to comply with an EU antitrust order and stave off fresh fines.The European Commission slapped a record 2.4-billion-euro ($2.8 billion) fine on the world´s most popular internet search engine in June and told the firm to stop favouring its shopping service. Google, a unit of US firm Alphabet, has until Sept. 28 to halt this anti-competitive practice or face a penalty up to 5 percent of its average daily worldwide turnover.The company said competitors would be able to bid for ads in the shopping box via an auction, confirming a Reuters report on Sept. 18.""We´re giving comparison shopping services the same opportunity to show shopping ads from merchants on Google´s search results pages as we give to Google Shopping,"" spokesman Al Verney said.""Google Shopping will compete on equal terms and will operate as if it were a separate business, participating in the auction in the same way as everyone else,"" he said. The changes will go into effect on Thursday and apply only in Europe.The shopping service will operate as an independent unit, with one team working with competing sites and another with merchants, and subjected to regulatory monitoring. The EU competition authority said it had hired auditor KPMG and marketing firm Mavens to help with the task.""It would be premature at this stage for the Commission to take any definite positions on Google´s plans. As (European Competition) Commissioner Vestager said, ´this issue will remain on our desks for some time´,"" Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said. Lobby group FairSearch, whose members include Google rivals such as British shopping comparison site Foundem and US travel site TripAdvisor, said it would keep a close eye on developments.""We will be watching closely to see if this remedy ends the abuse so that consumers get the best prices and most relevant results, and competitors have an opportunity to innovate,"" its lawyer Thomas Vinje said. About a dozen rivals out of an estimated 200 to 300 comparison shopping services in Europe have already provided feeds to Google.Several have criticised the proposal for not addressing the regulatory concerns. Deutsche Bank analysts estimate the European product listing ads (PLAs) business should generate between $4 billion to $5 billion in 2017, representing about 5 percent of the company´s total ad revenue.Analyst Lloyd Walmsley estimated that if Google was forced to make changes, it could lop 30 percent off of these revenues, or about 1-2 percent of Alphabet´s total revenue. Google is also under EU fire over its smartphone operating system Android, as well as its AdSense for Search platform."
2,"WASHINGTON: Rocky outcrops in eastern Canada contain what may be some of the oldest evidence of life on Earth, dating back about 3.95 billion years.Scientists said Wednesday they had found indirect evidence of life in the form of bits of graphite contained in sedimentary rocks from northern Labrador that they believe are remnants of primordial marine microorganisms.The researchers carried out a geological analysis of the Labrador rocks and measured concentrations and isotope compositions of the graphite, concluding that it was produced by a living organism.They did not find fossils of the microorganisms that may have left behind the graphite, a form of carbon, but said they may have been bacteria.“The organisms inhabited an open ocean,” University of Tokyo geologist Tsuyoshi Komiya — who led the study published in the journal Science — said.Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and the oceans appeared roughly 4.4 billion years ago.The new study and some other recent research indicate that microbial life emerged earlier than previously known and relatively soon after the Earth’s formation.Canada has produced some of the most ancient signs of life.Another team of scientists in March reported that microfossils between 3.77 billion and 4.28 billion years old found in northern Quebec, relatively close to the Labrador site, are similar to the bacteria that thrive today around seafloor hydrothermal vents.Other scientists last year described 3.7 billion-year-old fossilized microbial mats, called stromatolites, from Greenland."
3,"MOSCOW: Romelu Lukaku struck twice to lead Manchester United to an emphatic 4-1 away win over CSKA Moscow in Champions League Group A on Wednesday.The Belgian striker headed home after four minutes and tapped in just before the interval for his 10th goal of the season to put the English Premier League side 3-0 ahead at halftime.Lukaku took advantage of CSKA’s porous defence, tapping in a cross by Anthony Martial that bounced past central defender Vasily Berezutsky.Patient and energetic with the ball, United capitalised on a string of mistakes by CSKA’s backline, creating space and opportunities to attack.Martial had slotted home a penalty in between Lukaku’s goals and Henrikh Mkhitaryan added a fourth in the second half to give United a maximum six points from their opening two matches.Konstantin Kuchaev grabbed a late consolation for CSKA in the 90th minute, depriving United - unbeaten this season and level on points with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League - of a second successive Champions League shutout.United, without first-choice central midfielders Paul Pogba, Marouane Fellaini and Michael Carrick, lead the group by three points from CSKA and Basel.CSKA‘S defensive woes outshone the few dangerous chances they had, including a powerful strike by Fedor Chalov that was punched over the bar by United goalkeeper David de Gea early in the second half."
4,"An American student — who had been imprisoned in North Korea for 17 months — died from lack of oxygen and blood to the brain, an Ohio coroner said on Wednesday.Otto Warmbier’s death on June 19 was due to an unknown injury that occurred more than a year before his death, Hamilton County Coroner Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco said at a news conference.“We don’t know what happened to him and that’s the bottom line,” Sammarco said.Warmbier’s parents could not be reached for comment on the coroner’s report.Warmbier — the 22-year-old University of Virginia student — was held by North Korea from January 2016 until his release on June 15. He was returned to the United States in a coma.The coroner and a September 11 report by her office cited complications of chronic deficiency of oxygen and blood supply to the brain in Warmbier’s death.Only an external examination of the body rather than a full autopsy was conducted at the request of Warmbier’s family.North Korea had blamed botulism and the ingestion of a sleeping pill for Otto Warmbier’s problems and dismissed torture claims.Warmbier died days after arriving back in the United States.The native of Wyoming, Ohio, had been arrested at the airport in Pyongyang as he prepared to leave the reclusive communist country. He had been travelling with a tour group.Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for trying to take from his hotel an item bearing a propaganda slogan, North Korea’s state media reported.""As we looked at him and tried to comfort him, it looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth,” Fred Warmbier — the deceased student's father — told Fox News in an interview on Tuesday, alleging his son had been tortured.“Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017. Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea,” President Donald Trump said on Twitter following the interview’s broadcast.In response to a question at the news conference, the coroner said there was no evidence of trauma to Warmbier’s teeth nor was there evidence of broken bones.The coroner’s report said that Warmbier’s body had multiple scars varying in size, including a large irregular one measuring 4.3 by 1.6 inches on the right foot."
5,"LONDON: Leading western media practitioners have said that Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK) issue doesn’t get due coverage in western press because various vested interests are at play, including Indian government’s intolerance of media that highlights Kashmir conflict.Leading figures who have worked for influential western media outlets gathered in London for the International Media Conference held under the auspices of International Commission for Human Rights and South Asia Centre for Peace and Human Rights.The opening session was chaired by Barrister A. Majid Tramboo who stressed the need upon the conference panelists and participants to highlight the elements that would bring the Kashmir issue, including the gross human rights atrocities being perpetrated there to huge limelight by the international media.Chris Leslie MP, Chairman of All Parties Parliamentarians Group on Kashmir (APPG) in the British Parliament, said that the APPG on Kashmir has decided to visit Srinagar and Muzaffarabad in the upcoming spring. He stressed a unified focus by Kashmiri diaspora to highlight this left-behind legacy.Prof Nazir A Shawl articulated the media to play a fair role in projecting the Kashmir conflict with specific reference to the ongoing utter human rights violations in the occupied territory of Jammu & Kashmir.Victoria Schofield, author and journalist, said that vested interests play a role in media reporting; Kashmir may have become a complex issue but it is for the media to create narratives; one must go to the ground which is fundamental to the distribution of genuine information. George Carey, documentary film-maker and a famous former BBC stalwart presenter, said that access to conflict areas is the biggest problem and that makes it harder to verify citizen journalism; sharing his experience he believes that it is “bits and pieces” in conflict zones that makes news and that is what local media should explore.Robert Gallimore, researcher and journalist, emphasised three factors in media reporting; (i) there has to be a clear villain and injustice, (ii) there is need for a tangible solution which should be clearly articulated (iii) a simple and perpetual narrative.Dr Alfred De Zayas, United Nations Independent Expert on the Promotion of Democratic and Equitable International Order, articulated that democracy is an expression of self-determination and that the media must report thoroughly and responsibly. “It should not focus exclusively on politically correct or fashionable issues but must also address neglected topics such as Kashmir and others.”Lord Duncan emphasised that the media, as a matter of course, should report human rights violations wherever they occur. Tahir Aziz (South Asia Programme Director, Conciliation Resources) highlighted that it is paramount for Kashmiri people to demonstrate conciliatory approaches to get stakeholders involved in building peace and resolution and this will get the media attention as simply media reporting is not enough to get the problem solved as it is evident from other heavily reported conflicts. Kelvin Hopkins MP re-iterated his support to the Kashmir cause and stated that the media may not interfere in political decision-making but it can objectively shape the desired direction towards resolution of the conflict and as Kashmiris struggle is for democracy they deserve media support.Martin Weightman pointed out that religious leaders in conflict areas should separate themselves from political positions as it is often seen that religion is used as justification for political goals. He emphasised that journalists’ vital role is to focus on conflicts and report on them impartially and independently. Francoise Tihon, a journalist from Brusells, said that media exposure in conflict areas is directly linked with situations as they develop in those places.Gavin Shuker MP stated that the will of the people needs to be ascertained to move forward and that the media can be a great resource to promote people’s aspiration in an objective manner. He stressed that the way forward to resolve the Kashmir conflict is through people’s will and this is what the media ought to stress.Ianina Cozari, Brussels based Russian journalist, Alaa Bayoumi, news editor Al Jazeera, Sabia Akram Hussain, Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member of Social and Health Care of Slough Council, Betty Cleeren, Ranjit Singh Sarai, Leon Kaulahau Siu, BBC’s Sajid Iqbal, Abdel Wahab Hani of United Nations Committee Against Torture and Rita Payne (President of the Commonwealth Journalists Association) addressed last session of the conference.— The article was originally published in The News."
6,"After denying engagement rumours earlier this year, Game of Thrones' onscreen — and offscreen — darlings Kit Harington and Rose Leslie finally announced their engagement late Wednesday night, according to a British media outlet reported.Harington — who plays Jon Snow in HBO's hit fantasy drama TV series — met Leslie in 2011 while filming the show's second season in Iceland, BBC reported.The British duo — both 30 — only had a brief on-screen romance before Ygritte, Leslie’s character, died in the arms of Snow in the Emmy-winning show's season four.""You know nothing, Jon Snow” — Ygritte's final words — became one of the series' most famous lines.Following Ygritte's shocking death, rumours surfaced that the two were dating and merely strengthened after the couple made its first public appearance together at the red carpet of the Olivier Awards back in 2016.“If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love,” Harington told Vogue magazine in an interview last year.""Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,"" he said.Harington termed the time he filmed Game of Thrones Season 2 as the most memorable moments of the show.Jon Snow does know something after all!"
7,"TUZLA, Bosnia and Herzegovina: Pakistani soldiers returned after a 23-year-long period to the metropolis, which greatly admires their humanitarian services to its inhabitants, particularly the Yugoslavian war refugees.At the time of war, Pakistan had sent two battalions from the Punjab regiment to Tuzla under the banner of the United Nations to help strengthen peacekeeping efforts.This time, however, Tuzla is the same as it was back then but the situation and environment have changed drastically.A medical team of the Pakistan Army joined those from 34 other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations to learn and share experiences from the humanitarian response to natural disasters — such as floods and earthquakes — and their aftermath.The goal is to exercise civil defence during a flood situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina for five days.The relationship between Pakistan and NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre (EADRCC) dates back to 2005 when the former experienced an earthquake in Jammu & Kashmir with the intergovernmental military alliance supporting and managing the subsequent relief efforts.The coordination led to a greater cooperation between the countries and Pakistan was invited to Bosnia and Herzegovina to learn and share its experience with other member nations.The exercise was inaugurated by Sorin Ducaru — the Assistant Secretary-General for Emergency Security Challenges at NATO — and Bosnia and Herzegovina Security Minister Dragan Mektic.It shall offer an opportunity to 34 countries and ""around 1200 participants"" to learn international, multicultural cooperation and best practices when facing natural disasters.In this regard, it ""will help improve international cooperation in countries ranging from Spain to Serbia, from Bulgaria to Belarus, and from Croatia to Pakistan"", Ducaru said according to an update on NATO's website.""It will give responders the opportunity to test state-of-the-art technologies in relief operations,"" he added.The exercise shall additionally provide a chance to become familiar with new technologies in the field of disaster relief and management, as well as rapid response and organisation in dealing with calamities.This is the 17th international field exercise organised by the EADRCC and the first one hosted by Bosnia and Herzegovina.Talking to Geo.tv here, EADRCC coordinator Claudiu Zoicas — who also holds the position of liaison to the Pakistani forces — explained that participants from the NATO and partner countries will undergo and understand international cooperation in disaster response, including water rescue, chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) detection, protection, and decontamination.Projects that are supported by the NATO Science for Peace (SPS) Programme will also be tested and employed during the course of the exercise.These projects, according to the website, comprise an emergency response-related capacity building project in the Western Balkans, the ""Next-Generation Incident Command System,"" and a telemedicine system to boost medical support in disaster-stricken areas by remotely engaging medical experts from member countries.Several international organisations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) — such as the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), European Union (EU), London-based Save the Children, and the Red Cross Society of Bosnia and Herzegovina — will also partake in the exercise."
8,"NEW YORK: Brent prices fell on Wednesday while US crude rallied, after crude stockpiles in the world’s top oil consumer unexpectedly drew down with refiners coming back online following Hurricane Harvey last month.Brent slipped from 26-month highs to settle down 54 cents (or nearly 1 percent) at $57.90 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) ended 26 cents (or 0.5 percent) higher at $52.14 but stayed below five-month highs.US crude inventories fell 1.8 million barrels last week, the US Energy Department said, versus forecasts for a 3.4-million-barrel build.The crude draw supported oil prices, but gasoline stocks surprisingly rose and stocks of distillates were down by less than anticipated.“Gains in WTI oil prices will be capped because of recovering oil production in the US,” Abhishek Kumar — a senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London — said.Refinery utilization rates jumped 5.4 percentage points to 88.6 percent of total capacity, the highest rate since Harvey hit on August 25, government data showed, as most facilities have come back online.The effects of that storm, as well as Hurricane Irma — which struck Florida earlier this month — may dampen demand for some time, potentially increasing gasoline inventories while crude stocks are drawn down thanks to renewed refining activity.Oil prices have been supported by output curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers, although US crude has lagged behind Brent amid concerns that US production-growth could stoke oversupply.Data showed that US crude production rose to 9.55 million barrels per day last week — higher than levels before Harvey hit the Gulf Coast.With Brent futures commanding their highest premium over WTI in more than two years, US crude has become increasingly competitive in foreign markets and exports hit a record of 1.5 million BPD last week, according to data.“Seeing exports of US produced crude that large would pose a threat to the level that the Brent-WTI premium can go,” Gene McGillian — the manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut — said.Diesel exports were also rising, in part, because lower US crude prices boost margins for US refiners compared with those in Europe."
9,"MURREE: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Wednesday visited family of martyred Lieutenant Arsalan Alam and offered his condolences to them.The 22-year-old officer, from Gehl village in Murree, was martyred on Sunday while commanding a post in Rajgal Valley, which borders Afghanistan. The post came under fire from the Afghan side.The prime minister hailed the martyred officer for his valour and extended his heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved relatives.Terrorists fired from across the border at Pakistani post in Rajgal, martyring Lt Arsalan Alam: ISPR The 22-year-old officer was martyred in a cross-border attack in Khyber Agency Abbasi also interacted with locals at Lieutenant Arsalan's residents and assured them that soon their village will be provided gas. He said the Gehl-Dhanda road will be named after the martyred officer.The premier said the government school for women in the village will also be named after Lieutenant Arsalan Alam."
10,"MADRID: Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi came off the bench to snatch a 2-1 win at Atletico Madrid on Wednesday with the last kick of the game, taking Antonio Conte’s side top of Champions League Group C.France international Antoine Griezmann rammed a penalty beyond former Atletico goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to give the home side a barely deserved lead in the 40th minute, scoring the first European goal at their new stadium after striking the first Liga goal there this month.Former Real Madrid forward Alvaro Morata, who also spent time in Atletico’s youth system, pulled Chelsea level by glancing in Eden Hazard’s cross in the 60th minute after the visitors had failed to make their first-half dominance count.Batshuayi replaced Morata with seven minutes remaining and inflicted a first home defeat on Atletico since September 2015 by turning in a Marcos Alonso cutback from close range deep into stoppage-time.Atletico coach Diego Simeone has likened Atletico’s new home to the Circus Maximus in Rome and the team’s famously vociferous fans made a noise fitting of the biggest game in the stadium’s short existence, but Chelsea soon calmed the atmosphere.Hazard, without a goal in the Champions League since March 2015, was Chelsea’s chief creator, dashing through the middle to lay the ball off for Morata to screw wide and hitting the woodwork with a ferocious long range strike the next.Atletico struggled to get into Chelsea’s half but capitalised from their first real foray forward. A deflected shot from Saul Niguez earned a corner from which David Luiz hauled Lucas Hernandez to the floor, leaving Griezmann to score a third goal in four games.Simeone’s side could have grabbed a second on the cusp of halftime when Courtois could only hold Koke’s stinging shot but Saul slotted the rebound just wide of the near post.A two-goal deficit would have been grossly unfair on Conte’s adventurous side, who also had the better of the second half.Morata wasted a chance to strike again when he skipped towards goal unchallenged, scuffing the ball wide of Oblak’s goal, but Belgian international Batshuayi needed just one chance to grab a win that was as dramatic as it was deserved."
11,"YANGON: Myanmar’s government will manage the redevelopment of villages torched during violence in Rakhine state that has sent nearly half a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, a minister was reported on Wednesday as saying.The plan for the redevelopment of areas destroyed by fires — which the government has blamed on Rohingya insurgents — is likely to raise concern about prospects for the return of the 480,000 refugees, and compound fears of ethnic cleansing.“According to the law, burnt land becomes government-managed land,” Win Myat Aye — the Minister for Social Development, Relief and Resettlement — told a meeting in the Rakhine state capital of Sittwe, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.Myat Aye also heads a committee tasked with implementing recommendations on solving Rakhine’s long-simmering tensions.Citing a disaster management law, he said in a meeting with authorities on Tuesday that redevelopment would “be very effective”. The law says the government oversees reconstruction in areas damaged in disasters, including conflict.There was no elaboration on any plan or what access to their old villages any returning Rohingya could expect.The minister was not immediately available for comment.With the help of satellite images, human rights groups have said about half of over 400 Rohingya villages in the north of Rankine state have been burned in the violence.Refugees arriving in Bangladesh have accused the army and Buddhist vigilantes of mounting a campaign of violence and arson aimed at driving Rohingya out of Myanmar.In Washington, lawmakers in the US Congress condemned the treatment of the Rohingya and some questioned the former Obama administration’s decision to lift sanctions on Myanmar after a civilian-led government came to power.Ed Royce — the Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — told a hearing the Myanmar government’s response to the crisis had been “appalling.”Royce said national leader Aung San Suu Kyi had a duty to speak out and that her statements on the crisis had been “widely off the mark”.“Perpetrators of this ethnic cleansing must be condemned in the strongest possible terms,” he said.Ted Yoho — the Republican chair of the subcommittee — said the military crackdown had been characterized by “sickening crimes against humanity” and said Washington should look at what policy options were available to stop the military violence and encourage the government to take a firmer stand against it.The Trump administration has stepped up its criticism of the Myanmar military’s behaviour, but has refrained from using the terms “ethnic cleansing” or “crimes against humanity” and given no indication of plans to re-impose sanctions on the country where it competes for influence with strategic rival China.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has rejected UN accusations of ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims in response to coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on the security forces on August 25.It has also rejected accusations of crimes against humanity levelled this week by Human Rights Watch.The government has said about half of Rohingya villages have been abandoned but blames insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army for attacking civilians. It says nearly 500 people have been killed since August 25 — of which, it claims, nearly 400 are insurgents.The violence and the refugee exodus is the biggest crisis that the government of Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi has faced since it came to power last year in a transition from nearly 50 years of military rule.Myanmar considers the Rohingya illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and bouts of suppression and strife have flared for decades. Most Rohingya are stateless.Suu Kyi has faced scathing criticism and calls for her Nobel prize to be withdrawn. She denounced rights violations in an address last week and vowed that abusers would be prosecuted. She also said any refugees verified as coming from Myanmar under a 1992 process agreed with Bangladesh would be allowed back.Suu Kyi has little, if any, control over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution that also bars her from the presidency and gives the military veto power over political reform.Many refugees are gloomy about their chances of going home, saying they fear they lack the paperwork they expect would be demanded to prove they came from Myanmar.Myanmar is due to take a party of diplomats to the conflict zone on Thursday to let them see the situation.A group of aid organizations said on Tuesday the total number of refugees who had fled to Bangladesh since August 25 had been revised up to 480,000 after 35,000 people were found to have been missed out of the previous tally.Aid agencies say refugees are still arriving, though at a slower pace.They have an overall plan to help 1.2 million people — including 200,000 Rohingya already in camps in Bangladesh and 300,000 people in “host communities”.“They have absolutely nothing,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in Geneva after returning from a visit to the camps in Bangladesh.“It is very clear the cause of this crisis is in Myanmar but that the solution is also in Myanmar,” he said.“The risk of spread of terrorist violence in this particular region is very, very high” unless the issue was resolved, he warned.Grandi said he had not been informed about government plans for redevelopment but it had to include all communities.“If development is not inclusive, it will not be addressing the root causes and solve the problem,” he said."
12,"ABU DHABI: The trophy unveiling of Pakistan's three-match Test series against Sri Lanka was held at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi.Pakistani skipper Sarfraz Ahmed and Sri Lankan captain Dinesh Chandimal unveiled the trophy at the ceremony.The first Test between the two sub-continental sides will start today at Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium in Abu Dhabi, while the second Test will be played in Dubai.Prior to the trophy unveiling, the newly appointed captain of Pakistan Test side Sarfraz Ahmed requested the Sri Lankan team to visit Pakistan for the matches. ""Pakistan is now a very peaceful country and security situation is far better than previous years,"" said Sarfraz.Replying to a question asked by Geo News, Sarfraz Ahmed said that all players are perfectly fit and ready to play against Sri Lanka.When asked about playing without Misbah and Younis Khan, he expressed that it won't be easy to fill the void, but youngsters would perform well. The skipper also mentioned that the batting order has faced changes following Misbah and Younis Khan's departure.""Azhar Ali will play at one-down position while vice-Captain Asad Shafique would come at number four down the line,"" Sarfraz revealed.After the trophy unveiling, Sri Lankan Captain Dinesh Chandimal expressed that his side has an advantage due to Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan's absence in Pakistan playing XI after their retirement.Chandimal accepted that the previous series of Sri Lanka was not good as it should be, but he expected that his team will regain its lost form.Responding to a question about Sri Lanka's tour to Pakistan, he said that team players were not discussing it.""Sri Lankan cricket board and team management are obviously discussing Pakistan's tour"", he clarified. The Sri Lankan skipper also said that Pakistan's visit completely depended on the security situation in Pakistan."

14,"HYDERABAD: Investigation into the murder of Tania Khaskheli has been completed as the key accused has admitted to the killing.As per the police report, accused Khan Noohani, Ali Noohani and Maula Bakhsh have admitted to Tania’s murder. According to Khan Noohani, he was on unpleasant terms with Tania for a month during which they also got into arguments.On the other hand, the accused’s pistol and bullet casings found from the site of murder have matched at the forensic laboratory where the material was sent for test.Ali Nohani, one of the two accused name in the FIR, was the murderer's accomplice, the police sayAli Noohani, who was the last accused in the case, was nabbed a few days back from Sanghar, while Khan was arrested from Balochistan on September 18.During the investigation, it surfaced that Ali aided Khan in fleeing from crime scene, Jamshoro SSP Irfan Bahadur said.On September 7, Khan Noohani killed Tania over her refusal to marry him. The girl’s father had told the police that Khan along with his accomplices had barged into their house in an area of Sehwan. The deceased’s father said the accused tried to intimidate them with their weapons. However, the girl’s resistance infuriated Khan who then shot her dead. "
15,"PARIS: Paris St Germain tore apart Bayern Munich to win 3-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday as the French club’s expensively-assembled attack made another devastating statement of their potency.Dani Alves, Edinson Cavani and Neymar found the net, with Kylian Mbappe also making his mark with two assists, to put PSG top of Group B with a maximum six points.Bayern, who started with defender Mats Hummels and wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery on the bench, lacked pace up front and were overwhelmed at the back despite a good spell in the middle of the first half.The German champions are level on three points with Celtic, who beat pointless Anderlecht 3-0 away.PSG, unbeaten in their last nine Champions League games at home, played their preferred 4-3-3 formation with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who cost the Qatar-backed club around 400 million euros (349.82 million pounds) between them, in support of Edinson Cavani.The home side quickly got on top as Neymar danced past defenders on the left edge of the box before crossing low for his compatriot Alves to fire past Christian Fruechtl in the second minute.Bayern, however, exploited PSG’s struggles in midfield to create chances, the best of them coming in the 19th minute when Alphonse Areola tipped a fierce Javi Martinez half volley over the bar.PSG were more dangerous on the break and Mbappe’s speed proved devastating.After Neymar wasted a clear chance, Mbappe broke into the area, turned and found Cavani, whose strike went into the top corner in the 31st minute for the Uruguayan’s 10th goal in as many games with PSG this season.Neymar missed the target early in the second half but gobbled up his next chance.Mbappe snaked his way through the Bayern defence in the 63rd minute and found Neymar, who tapped in to wrap it up.Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti replaced James Rodriguez with Paris-born Kingsley Coman in the second half and the French forward brought life to the visitors’ left flank.He came close to reducing the arrears in the closing stages but Areola, who was impeccable throughout, tipped his shot away to keep a clean sheet.Mbappe, arguably the best player on the pitch, was given a standing ovation when he was replaced in the 78th minute by Argentina international Angel Di Maria, with the change acting as further evidence of PSG’s strength in depth."
16,"BEIJING: Washington has opened channels to North Korea to find out if the regime is ready to talk about giving up its nuclear weapons, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Saturday.Speaking after a day of talks with China´s President Xi Jinping and top diplomats, Tillerson told reporters that US officials are in touch with Pyongyang.The disclosure follows an escalating war of words between US President Donald Trump and North Korean strongman Kim Jong-Un, and Tillerson issued a call for calm.Asked how he could know whether the North would even contemplate responding to new sanctions by coming to the table, the US envoy said: ""We are probing, so stay tuned.""Washington has no diplomatic ties with Kim´s autocratic regime, and has been leaning on Beijing to rein in its neighbour´s behaviour through tougher sanctions.But Tillerson said US diplomats do not rely on China as a go-between in overtures to North Korea, and have themselves talked directly through ""our own channels.""""We ask,"" he said. ""We have lines of communication with Pyongyang. We´re not in a dark situation, a blackout, we have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang.""""We can talk to them, we do talk to them,"" he said.The US has not ruled out the use of force to compel Pyongyang to halt missile and nuclear tests, and last week Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" the country.But privately senior figures admit the military options do not look promising, with ally South Korea´s densely populated capital Seoul in range of the North´s artillery.Tillerson, meanwhile, has been a proponent of a campaign of ""peaceful pressure"", using US and UN sanctions and working with China to turn the screw on the regime.But his efforts have been overshadowed by an extraordinary war of words, with Trump mocking Kim as ""little Rocket Man"" and Kim branding the US leader a ""dotard"".Even as Tillerson met Xi and China´s top diplomats State Councillor Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the North´s propaganda agency fired a new barrage of insults.The statement proclaimed Trump an ""old psychopath"" bent on the ""suicidal act of inviting a nuclear disaster that will reduce America to a sea of flames"".North Korea´s rhetoric has been backed by a provocative series of ballistic missile tests and on September 3 it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test.In the decade since the North´s first nuclear explosion, it has made rapid progress in developing the kind of missile technology that would allow it to hit US targets.Washington, backed by most of the international community, has declared North Korea´s programme unacceptable, fearing that its own vast arsenal will not deter Kim from attack.With the world on edge, fears are growing that a miscalculation from either side could trigger a renewed deadly conflict on the divided Korean peninsula.Some recent tests saw North Korean missiles flying over Japan en route to the Pacific, and its latest underground detonation seems to have been of a powerful hydrogen bomb.Observers have expressed concern that if the North carries out an atmospheric nuclear test over the ocean, Washington will feel obliged to take risky military action.But Tillerson said that decision would be up to Trump alone and that ""as far as I know the commander in chief has issued no red lines.""Tillerson instead called for calm, singling out Pyongyang´s missile tests for criticism, but not rushing to defend Trump´s own heated rhetoric and bellicose tweets.""The whole situation is a bit overheated right now. I think everyone would like for it to calm down,"" he said in response to a question about Trump´s threats.""I think if North Korea would stop firing all the missiles, that would calm down things a lot,"" he said.Tillerson, who was in Beijing to plan for a summit that Xi will host for Trump in November, welcomed recent measures taken by China to crack down on its neighbour.The opening remarks at his three meetings with Xi, Yang and Wang contained no reference to North Korea, but he said afterwards the issue had been discussed.US leaders criticised Beijing for taking too soft a line with Pyongyang, but in recent weeks China has taken more drastic measures to cut off trade and finance.And in public, at least, the Chinese officials were all smiles for their guest.Xi touted what he said was his ""good working relationship and personal friendship"" with Trump and predicted that the summit ""will be a special, wonderful and successful one""."

18,"LISBON: Barcelona laboured to a second successive Champions League victory after Sebastian Coates’ own goal helped the Spanish side record an unconvincing 1-0 Group D win against Sporting on Wednesday.After a frustrating first half, Barcelona scored in fortunate circumstances when Coates bundled into his own net under pressure from Luis Suarez in the 49th minute.Lionel Messi made his 593rd Barcelona appearance -- tying him third with Carles Puyol on the club’s all-time list -- but the Argentine was unable to add to his brace against Juventus in their opening win.Barcelona have been in free-scoring mood this season, with 20 goals in six La Liga games, but were left frustrated by a host of missed opportunities in the opening half in Lisbon.Suarez wasted a simple chance in the 18th minute when he side-footed wide after Jordi Alba had been set free by a sublime Messi pass.The visitors dominated possession but lacked their usual cutting edge against the hosts’ well-organised defence, with Messi heading a good opportunity straight at Rui Patricio.With the creative triumvirate of Andres Iniesta, Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets struggling to impose themselves, Messi was forced to drop deeper, leaving Suarez isolated at attack.The second half was only four minutes old when Coates converted beyond Patricio and, though Barcelona controlled possession thereafter, it was Sporting who created the best opportunities.Marc-Andre ter Stegen made a brilliant save to deny Bruno Fernandes during a strong period for Sporting in the 71st minute before substitute Paulinho wasted a late chance to double Barcelona’s advantage when he fired straight at Patricio.Barcelona are top of group D with six points, three clear of Sporting and last season’s finalists Juventus who beat Olympiakos 2-0. The Greek champions have yet to pick up a point after two games."
19,"ABU DHABI: Young Pakistani opener Sami Aslam has said that Pakistan is still in the better position despite losing four wickets on the third day against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi Test.Speaking to Geo News, Aslam said the conditions were very tough for the players at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. ""I have played in Abu Dhabi previously but the weather is more harsh and hot as compared to the past years,"" he added.The left hand batsman maintained that he wanted to make more runs but unfortunately he could not judge the ball when he was given an LBW off Dilruwan Perera. Aslam has already made six half centuries in 11 Tests and got appreciated in England after scoring three half centuries there.While replying to a question about his comeback in the Test squad, Aslam said he intended to perform consistently in the team so the selectors do not drop him again.""I want to perform consistently so the uncertainty of the selection is over,"" he said with a smile.Aslam has come up from the under-19 ranks. He was part of Pakistan’s under-19 team in both 2012 and 2014 world cups. In fact he was captain of the 2014 team which lost in the finals at Dubai cricket stadium. "
20,"LONDON: Moeen Ali says England can still win the Ashes on enemy turf even if talismanic all-rounder Ben Stokes is not in the party that travels to Australia.Stokes was arrested earlier this week on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and suspended from internationals until further notice following an apparent fight outside a nightclub.The Test vice-captain was included in the Ashes squad despite reportedly injuring his hand in the incident that led to his arrest but there are doubts over whether he will be on the plane to Australia.The 26-year-old Durham all-rounder was released without charge but remains under investigation.Ali, speaking after England wrapped up their summer schedule with a nine-wicket win against a poor West Indies side in Southampton on Friday, acknowledged Stokes´s importance but said they could win without him.""We all know how good a cricketer he is, what he can bring to the table and he's one of the main players that we have, so it would be great to have him out there but let´s see what happens,"" he said.""If he's not there then we're going to have to play well without him so I definitely feel that we can still win.""Ali, named the man of the series against the West Indies, said he was looking forward to the challenge of retaining the Ashes. England won the series when it was last held at home in 2015 but have lost two of the past three series in Australia 5-0.""The wickets are actually really good out there,"" said the 30-year-old off-spinner, who hit England´s second-fastest ODI hundred off just 53 balls in the third ODI against the West Indies.""I feel when you get in it feels like it´s a good place to bat. The ball doesn't obviously swing as much. Hopefully, I can come in, whatever number I come in I can express myself and change the way I play. I´m going to have to change a couple of things.""England may have enjoyed Test series wins over South Africa (3-1) and West Indies (2-1) in the past few months but they ended their home Test campaign pretty much where they started it - with doubts over a number of positions at the top of the batting order.There were Ashes recalls this week for middle-order batsmen James Vince and Gary Ballance despite the pair´s struggles during their previous Test stints.The absence of Stokes could mean a move up the order for the elegant Ali, who usually bats at number eight in Tests but he said he would be comfortable with that.""Number eight is somewhere I´m kind of used to at the moment but if I'm told to bat seven I feel I'm capable of doing well and hopefully can show that I can go out there and play against their bowlers, play well against them,"" he said.""I can't wait,"" he added. ""Genuinely I can´t wait. I´m very, very excited. It´s something that when you´re a young county player you´re always thinking you´d love to be on that sort of tour.""I never, ever thought I´d be on a tour like this so to be going I´m very, very fortunate and I know that hopefully we´ll go out there and perform and win the Ashes.""England is due to travel to Australia on October 28, with the first of five Tests against their arch-rivals set to start in Brisbane on November 23."

22,"GIRONA: Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont called Saturday for ""mediation"" to resolve the ""serious"" conflict pitting his executive against the central government, on the eve of an independence referendum banned by Madrid.""If the yes wins, if the no wins -- in any scenario there must be mediation, because things aren´t working,"" he told AFP.Vowing that he and his supporters would vote on Sunday, and that the regional government had everything in place so that the referendum ""takes place normally,"" he called on Catalans to maintain a ""peaceful attitude.""The standoff between the central government and Catalan leaders over their plans to hold an independence referendum has morphed into one of the biggest crises to hit Spain in decades.Madrid argues the vote is illegal as the courts have ruled it unconstitutional.But Puigdemont and his team insist Catalonia has a democratic right to decide on its future.Opinion polls show the wealthy, northeastern region is deeply divided over independence, but a large majority of Catalans want to be able to settle the matter in a legal and binding vote.Puigdemont did not call on any specific person, organisation or country to mediate, but he hinted that the EU may be well placed to do so.""I think that from now it would be logical for the EU to actively monitor (the situation) and actively take an interest,"" he said.""If it doesn´t take an interest in what is happening in Catalonia when everyone is watching and taking an interest, there´s something wrong.""He reiterated his call on the Spanish government to negotiate over holding a legal, binding referendum and promised to call the entire vote off if the state agreed.But this is unlikely to happen.Thousands of police have been deployed to Catalonia to stop the vote, millions of ballot papers seized, key referendum organisers detained, and websites promoting the vote shut down.But still, separatist leaders are determined to hold a vote with a semblance of legitimacy on Sunday."
23,"KARACHI: Pakistan is one of those countries in the world where medicines are being transported without cold chain management and the government, especially the Sindh government, does not to do anything, a doctor working with Pakistan Medical Association told Geo News.""The prime responsibility to ensure cold chain management rests with drug manufacturers, after that retailers are responsible of maintaining the temperature of a drug,"" said Dr Qaiser Sajjad, member of the PMA.Dr Asif Zaman, Medical Superintendent at Government Children Hospital Nazimabad, explained that the required temperature of a drug which includes vaccines, antibiotics, injections and ointments are from 2°C to 8°C.Dr Sajjad said unfortunately salespersons at medical stores do not know about the cold chain management and they don't even have backup support in case of a power outage.While surveying, Geo News also came across the fact that nearly 80 per cent of drug retailers were unaware of cold chain management.Dr Mohammad Taufeeq, Director Health Karachi, said their drug inspectors regularly check and conduct raids on the medical stores. He, however, admitted lack of arrangements to maintain temperature of drugs in the metropolis.According to Director Health Karachi's office, only two drug inspectors have been working in the field for over 20 million strong population of the city.Dr Sikander Ali Mandhro, provincial minister for Health, said that we are aware of the issue, but for vaccination our Extended Program for Immunisation (EPI) has World Health Organisation-recommended cold chain management system, which is working in the entire province.""As far as shortage of drug inspectors is concerned, we are soon to advertise vacancies for drug inspectors,"" Mandhro added.It has been learnt that medicines, whose temperature is not maintained, eventually have their efficacy affected. Retailers should avoid drugs' exposure to sunlight and store them in fridge, whereas ointments for ears, eyes and nose should not be used more than 30 days after the first opening.The PMA has urged the central and provincial governments and concerned departments to maintain cold chain management and regulate a monitoring system for drug stores, and to put heavy penalty and/or fine in in case of a violation."
24,"FRANKFURT: German police announced Saturday the arrest of a 53-year-old man ""strongly suspected"" of poisoning baby food and threatening to contaminate other products in stores nationwide and across Europe.The man was detained by officers near Tubingen, south of Stuttgart, following information received from the public, police and prosecutors said in a joint statement.At a press conference, they said that the man had refused to shed light on his motives but that evidence implicating him was discovered at his home. It also appears that he acted alone.Local deputy chief of police Uwe Stuermer described the man as ""eccentric"" and mentally disturbed.On Thursday police alerted the public to the risk of food being poisoned, saying a blackmailer was demanding millions of euros in cash.Authorities released surveillance footage of the suspect, whom they earlier described as aged 55, wearing glasses and a white cap, which ultimately led to the arrest.To press the demand, the blackmailer had poisoned five baby food products and last week alerted police to the store they were placed in, in the southern city of Friedrichshafen on Lake Constance.The food — which had been laced with ethylene glycol, a chemical found in anti-freeze and brake fluid — was found and removed.But it prompted the nationwide appeal for information on the suspect and a warning about the potential of other contaminated food, which authorities repeated Saturday.Through the video surveillance of the stores where the baby jars were identified, police were able to obtain images clearly showing the face of the 55-year-old man, who has not been named."

That's ridiculous -- the minimum for me is four,"" he says in the video. In anti-Daesh battles in 2015 ""I killed 173 of them, and now I'm at 320."""
26,"ABU DHABI: Azhar Ali once more rescued Pakistan's batting with a fighting half century on the third day of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.The one-drop batsman was unbeaten on 74 but saw Babar Azam fell for 28 in the last over of the day as Pakistan finished on 266-4 on a Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch which has started to assist spinners.Pakistan still trails the Sri Lankan first innings total of 419 by 153 runs with six wickets intact.Pakistan had pinned their hopes on Ali in the post-Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq era who retired in May this year after shouldering team's batting for nearly seven years.A cautious Ali made sure Pakistan does not concede a big lead in the first innings, having hit only one boundary in his 26th Test half-century.In all Ali has so far hit three boundaries during his 297 minutes of batting. He added 79 for the third wicket with Asad Shafiq who made 39 to take the fight to Sri Lankan three-pronged spin attack.Veteran left-arm spinner Herath was the most successful bowler with 2-47.When on 32, Ali also completed 5,000 Test runs in his 61st Test. He became the eighth Pakistan batsmen behind Younis Khan (10,099), Javed Miandad (8832) Inzamam-ul-Haq (8829), Mohammad Yousuf (7530), Salim Malik (5768), Misbah (5222) and Zaheer Abbas (5062) to reach the milestone.But it was the opening pair of Shan Masood and Sami Aslam who set the platform for a big total by putting together a solid 114-run opening stand after they resumed at 64 without loss.Sri Lanka, however, hit back by removing both openers in the space of two runs.Aslam, recalled after being dropped from the West Indies tour on disciplinary grounds earlier this year, was trapped leg-before by off-break bowler Dilruwan Perera. He hit four boundaries in his seventh Test half century.Two runs later Masood attempted a sweep shot off the wily Herath but missed the ball and was bowled round his legs.Pakistan had luck on their side with the reviews as both Ali and Shafiq survived confident appeals. Ali wisely reviewed a leg-before decision off Perera, but the ball hit his bat before the pad.Shafiq was given not out on a review when he was stumped off Herath on one.It was Herath who finally dislodged Shafiq when a sharp turner caught an edge off Shafiq´s bat, deflected from wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella´s thigh to slip where Lahiru Thirimanne took the catch.Earlier, Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal scored a brilliant 155 not out while Niroshan Dickwella made a career best 83, to post a big 419 against Pakistan on the second day.Chandimal remained unbeaten over 546 minutes with 14 boundaries, which left Pakistan's bowlers frustrated on a flat pitch.Diruwan Perera added 33 to the Sri Lankan scoreboard.Fast bowler Mohammad Abbas (3-75) and leg-spinner Yasir Shah (3-120) sported the best figures for Pakistan."

35,"CARACAS: Around 1 million unvaccinated Venezuelan children are susceptible to measles — a highly contagious disease that has re-emerged in the crisis-stricken South American nation, a group of doctors estimated on Friday.A crippling shortage of medicines and vaccines — as well as decaying hospitals and an exodus of doctors — has thrown Venezuela’s health sector into a tailspin.Amid the crisis, once-controlled diseases, such as like diphtheria and measles, have returned to the fore, putting Venezuela’s 30 million people at risk and raising the threat of contagion beyond its borders.Measles — caused by a virus usually passed through direct contact and the air — is a top cause of death for young children although a vaccine is available.The World Health Organization warns it can be especially lethal in countries that have suffered violent conflict and whose health infrastructure is deteriorated.Venezuelan health associations first raised the alarm about the return of measles in the rough southern mining state of Bolivar in August. Since then, the WHO has reported 84 suspected cases, with 34 confirmed cases.“Preliminary data indicates it is evolving rapidly,” two Venezuelan public health organizations said of the measles outbreak in a report on Friday.“We’ve identified a suboptimal vaccination coverage, and on a national level, we estimate that at least 1,150,000 children under the age of 1 were not vaccinated… over the last 10 years,” the report added.Ana Carvajal — a doctor and one of the authors of the report — told Reuters the estimate is based on data obtained through sources at the Health Ministry and WHO figures.Still, an ongoing vaccination drive in Bolivar has likely lowered the risk.The WHO has said it is helping with the purchase and delivery of some 7.2 million vaccines against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) in Venezuela and hopes to spread the drive across the country.As Venezuela’s medical crisis has worsened, the Health Ministry has largely kept mum and no longer publishes a weekly bulletin that includes data on infant mortality or mosquito-borne diseases like malaria.The government did not respond to a request for comment on this story.Measles deaths dropped around 79 percent between 2000 and 2015 globally thanks to vaccinations, according to the WHO.However, gaps in the coverage have lead to several measles outbreaks in Europe in the past year, officials said in April, with lack of trust leading people to turn down potentially life-saving vaccines."

Authorities have not given any details about the incident.The failure means the launches of lunar probes Chang'e-5, originally scheduled to collect samples from the moon in the second half of 2017, and Chang'e-4, due to land on the dark side of the moon in 2018, will both have to be revised.New launch dates for the probes will be announced at the end of this year, Tian said.A core module for the construction of China's space station was also set to be blasted into space in 2018 but this will be delayed to 2019, Tian said Tuesday at the 68th International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide, Australia.China, which hopes to one day send humans to the moon, joined the United States and Soviet Union as the only nations to land on the Earth's natural satellite in 2013, when its lunar rover Yutu embarked on a 31-month mission beset by mechanical troubles.The following year the country completed its first return mission to the moon, with an unmanned probe landing successfully back on Earth.The Long March-5 Y2 had taken off in July with the Shijian-18 experimental communications satellite (7.5 tonnes), which it was supposed to put into orbit.The satellite would have provided communications services over China's territory -- boosting internet access and providing access to more television channels.Its failure followed successful space missions, including the June launch of the Long March-4B, China's first X-ray space telescope, to study black holes, pulsars and gamma-ray bursts.In April, the country's first cargo spacecraft completed its docking with an orbiting space lab -- a key development toward China's goal of having its own crewed space station by 2022.China is also aiming to launch six rovers to Mars in 2020."
37,"ABU DHABI: Fast bowler Mohammad Abbas said Saturday it was quite difficult to obtain wickets at present since the conditions ""are too grinding for bowlers"" in Abu Dhabi, where harsh weather and humidity created challenges.Abbas was speaking to reporters during a press conference at Sheikh Zayed Stadium after bagging three wickets in Pakistan's first innings against Sri Lanka here.The sportsman admitted that the conditions were completely different here in Abu Dhabi than those in the Caribbean. ""There was little grass on the pitch, which didn't help the bowlers,"" he said.The most successful bowler for Pakistan in the first innings sent three players of the competing Sri Lanka back to the pavilion for just 75 runs.Speaking to Geo.tv here, Abbas said he was disappointed on the first day of the match for not being able to take a single wicket even after trying hard.The cricketer regretted not being able to take the wicket of Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal even after blowing off stumps in the air since it was declared a no-ball.Abbas requested Pakistanis living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — especially those in Abu Dhabi — to show up at the stadium to lend support to Pakistan team."
38,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA: The United States on Friday cut its diplomatic presence in Cuba by more than half and warned US citizens not to visit because of mysterious “attacks” that have caused hearing loss, dizziness, and fatigue in US embassy personnel.The US embassy in Havana will halt regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and offer only emergency services to US citizens, steps that may further erode the US-Cuban rapprochement begun by former President Barack Obama.The partial evacuation — while depicted as a safety measure — sends a message of US displeasure over Cuba’s handling of the matter and delivers another blow to Obama’s policies of engagement with Cold War foe Cuba.The Communist Party-run Cuban government was already dealing with several delicate matters — the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, a steep decline in aid from important socialist ally Venezuela and political transition as President Raul Castro steps down next year.Cuba’s Foreign Ministry chief for US Affairs Josefina Vidal said, “We consider the decision announced today by the US government through the State Department is hasty and will affect bilateral relations.”Vidal — in a briefing on the state-run television — said Cuba was still keen to cooperate with US authorities to clarify what happened.Officials in President Donald Trump’s administration stressed the United States was maintaining diplomatic ties with Cuba.Twenty-one US embassy employees in Cuba have been injured and reported symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues, and difficulty sleeping, the State Department said.“Until the government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel in order to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement.The Cuban government has denied any role and is investigating. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has been looking into the incidents, a US law enforcement official said, but so far has not determined the cause.A senior State Department official said neither the US nor Cuban governments had been able to identify who was responsible but stressed that “the government of Cuba is responsible for taking all appropriate steps to prevent attacks on our diplomatic personnel in Cuba”.In a travel warning, the State Department bluntly said, “because our personnel’s safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe US citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba”.A State Department official said most visa processing had been suspended in Havana. “Cuban applicants for nonimmigrant visas may apply at another US embassy or consulate overseas.”The State Department said the attacks on US embassy personnel had occurred at “US diplomatic residences and hotels frequented by US citizens”. No tourists are known to have been injured in the attacks.Canada said it has no plans to change its travel advice for Cuba or to remove any Canadian staff from its embassy there, though some staff have experienced some unusual symptoms, Chrystia Freeland — a spokesperson for Foreign Affairs Minister — said on Friday.52-year-old Diana Rodriguez — who sells handicrafts in Old Havana — said she had a visa appointment in October so she could visit family who live in Florida.“I won’t ever go there now,” she said furiously. “This is a really strong blow that affects regular Cubans on the street. It’s just unheard of. What is going on with this man?”Trump in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by Obama — his Democratic predecessor — and called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations General Assembly this month.Engage Cuba — a Washingon-based lobbying group — said the decision was “puzzling” given that American travellers had not been targeted.It said halting the visa process in Cuba and discouraging Americans from going there “will divide families and harm Cuba’s burgeoning private sector, civil society groups and efforts to improve human rights on the island”.“I haven’t felt in danger at all. The people are very friendly, it’s a very safe culture… I don’t feel threatened at all here, I think it's a really safe place to be,” American visitor Joey Branch said.US lawmakers took positions on the issue that appeared to reflect their wider perspective on engagement with Havana.Senator Patrick Leahy — a Democrat who favours normalization — suggested the attacks may be an attempt to undermine this.“Whoever is doing this obviously is trying to disrupt the normalization process between the United States and Cuba. Someone or some government is trying to reverse that process,” Leahy said in a statement.Marco Rubio — a Florida Republican and frequent critic of the Cuban government — called for harsher measures.“Until those responsible for these attacks are brought to justice, the US should immediately expel an equal number of Cuban operatives, downgrade the US embassy in Havana to an interests section, and consider re-listing Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism,” Rubio said in a statement.American Tour Operators in Cuba, which counts more than 50 US companies, criticized the travel warning.“The motivation for the US government to issue today’s Travel Warning for Cuba is difficult to understand given that the facts and circumstances of these mysterious incidents have never posed a tangible threat to American visitors in Cuba.”American Airlines and United Airlines — both of whom have applied for additional flights to Havana — said the travel warning would not affect their current operations to Cuba.JetBlue Airways said it would waive change and cancellation fees for Cuba flights booked on or before Sept. 29.Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas said its operations in Cuba would continue. Cuba reported four million arrivals last year, of which 285,000 were Americans."
39,"A Moscow court said Thursday it had issued an arrest warrant for Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, who helped orchestrate the country's state-sponsored Olympic doping programme and has since fled to the United States.""The investigators put Rodchenkov on an international wanted list. Our court on September 21 issued a ruling to arrest him in absentia since he is wanted internationally,"" the court's spokeswoman Yunona Tsareva told AFP.Rodchenkov is the former director of Moscow's anti-doping lab that oversaw drug testing at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.In May 2016 he gave an interview to the New York Times describing an elaborate doping scheme that he said involved dozens of Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Russia's Black Sea city of Sochi.A bombshell report by a World Anti-Doping Agency independent commission published in November 2016 said Rodchenkov had admitted to ""intentionally destroying"" 1,417 test samples ahead of an audit.As a result, Russian track and field athletes were barred from the Rio Olympics last year and from the athletics World Championships in London last month.Russia has consistently denied running a state-run doping programme, with deputy prime minister Vitaly Mutko pinning all the blame on Rodchenkov's laboratory and Russia's Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).The Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, opened a criminal investigation into Rodchenkov in 2016, accusing him of abuse of office, for which he could serve up to four years in jail.In a New York Times op-ed piece published Friday, Rodchenkov said he fled his homeland because he feared for his life and his family's safety.Russia and the US do not have an extradition treaty."
40,"The first 10 days of Muharram are a busy time for Nasir Ali and his friends, who run pillar to post working tirelessly to give picture-perfect touches to their beloved project—a thriving Sabeel in Karachi's bustling neighborhood Soldier Bazaar.Apparently, it's a modest setup: few tables lined up on the footpath adjacent to Mehfil-e-Shahe Khorasan and covered with yards of plain black sheets, tents wrapped around to provide makeshift walls and ceiling, a couple of heavy duty energy savers and you have a temporary oasis running.But Nasir and company rejoice in the fact that their small effort serves a big cause. ""We set up this Sabeel remembering the thirst of Imam Hussain and for serving humanity. Imam Hussain and his followers didn't get water, but we want to make sure that no one goes thirsty at least in these 10 days.""This indeed is a task easier said than done, but for this group of dedicated friends, this is one mission they strive every yard to accomplish. Their activities start at seven in the evening and stretch to as late as midnight.For the past 10 years, little has changed in their Muharram routine. For 10 days in running they offer milk-based chilled sherbets (sweet drinks) to the mourners. The mix is often interesting and the taste, always heavenly.""Each day we try to make something different, the RoohAfza-based milk sherbet is an all time favorite. Then we have the almond, banana, mango pulp and Lassi. Today we are mixing ice-cream soda in milk. I am sure people will love it.""With the sultry and humid weather of Karachi scaling to legendary heights, these coolers, sprinkled with chopped nuts and often dashed with 'tukhme balanga', are a refreshing treat for the mourners who willingly accept it to quench their thirst. Not to mention that this demand keeps skyrocketing.""We start off with making around 80 liters of sherbet in the first 2-3 days, but as we get close to Ashur and more and more people start visiting our Sabeel, this quantity gradually grows up to 240-260 liters per day.""When questioned about the quality of milk, water and ingredients used, Sohail Abbas, another member of the team, was quick to point out that only the finest of items are used. ""We buy boiled milk from whole sale market and use distilled water to make our sherbet. The same goes for the dry fruits. I have my own kids drinking from the Sabeel, we will never use low quality stuff.”The cost of running this 10-day devotion comes close to a million rupees all pooled in by the friends themselves. As the Majlis comes to an end, scores of mourners line up, waiting calmly for their turn. Unlike the misadventures seen in political events, sanity prevails all around.""The crowds are always well behaved and harmony is at its peak. Shias, Sunnis all come to drink from the Sabeel and for us this is a great way to promote harmony in these tumultuous times. ""Unbelievable, but it's true, you can never take away the love of a well brewed cup of tea form a genuine Karachitte. 65-year-old Mustafa Bahadur Ali understands this chemistry well. No wonder, then, that his distinct offering, the refreshing cardamom tea, is in popular demand.Situated at the corner of Aza Khana-E- Zehra in Soldier bazaar, the Chai Sabeel has been running nonstop for the last 39 years and the tradition has been passed on to the 3rd generation.""My father started this Sabeel 39 years ago when Mr. Ahmed gave up his home for Aza Khana-E- Zehra. My father decided to serve tea. He passed on the tradition to me and now it's my kids who are shouldering the responsibility.""As Mustafa Bahadur Ali recalls, a lot has changed in the last 39 years, not to forget the economics of the common man's beloved drink. ""Back in those days, the entire cost for a day's offering was Rs 60 and it included everything. Today prices have gone so high that we find it hard to make an accurate estimate, but that doesn't keep us away from serving the mourners.""Mustafa’s 38-year-old-son Yaseen is the man holding things together. ""We start making tea around 7 and it's ready by 9.30. We use up to 30 kilos of tea and coffee and around 150 kilos of sugar during the Ashur days. We use powdered milk and cardamom as it gives our tea a very unique and refreshing taste.""Just like the Sherbet Sabeels, the tea offering starts with 2 Daighs (cauldrons) and ends up with three close to Ashur, offering approximately 160 to 180 liters of tea to the faithful each day.""We take great pride in serving the Azadars, it is a source of satisfaction that we are part of a good cause. Our entire family — kids, women and everyone — chips in to help. Manpower is never an issue. In fact, we often have to excuse people.""Just like Soldier Bazaar, the early days of Muharram sees Sabeels springing up in almost all neighbourhoods of Karachi with both Shias and Sunnis harbouring the centuries-old tradition.With the operational cost of running these Sabeels often running into millions, their purpose, however, remains the same. Karachittes, in this way, not only relive the sacrifices rendered by Imam Hussain (R.A.) and his companions, but also showcase their resilience towards religious intolerance and extremism.This article was originally published in October 2015—The writer tweets @AsharZaidiGeo"
41,"Former Australia captain Ian Chappell believes England “haven’t got a hope in hell” of winning the Ashes if all-rounder Ben Stokes is sidelined following a street brawl outside a Bristol nightclub.Stokes, vice-captain of the test side, was named in England’s 16-man squad for the Ashes tour starting in November but was suspended on Thursday until further investigation into the incident.“They can’t win without him (Stokes) for a number of reasons,” Chappell told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph on Thursday.”Obviously his ability is the main thing, but also, he’s a match-winning player and those sort of players drag the rest along with them and make them better.“He’s probably one of those players inspired by playing against the better teams and again that has a flow on effect to the fellas that don’t have that sort of confidence. I don’t think they’ve got a hope in hell without him.”While the Australian side may consider the suspension of Stokes a significant boost to their chances, former captain Allan Border believes the five-match test series would be spoiled without the firebrand all-rounder.“He is one of those cricketers you would go to watch play,” Border said. “He’s just got something about him, the aggressive nature of his cricket is exciting and it would be a real blow if he doesn’t come.”Former England captain Michael Vaughan said whatever the outcome of the case, Stokes has let himself down.”I am all for players having a bit of downtime,“ Vaughan told the BBC. ”In the world of cricket, with the players travelling all the time, you do need a bit of downtime, but he (Stokes) has to look himself in the mirror.“He can have as many talks from the England management, from his wife and his agent, but he has got to understand now what he’s doing and what he’s been involved in the last few days,” Vaughan added.”I just don’t understand why he would want to be in a bar at 2:30 in the morning on the Monday, before a game on the Wednesday.“He is putting himself in a place where he is a target. He is a very famous person these days.”Stokes has been a match-winning figure for the England side since making his debut against Australia in 2013. In 39 tests, he has scored 2,429 runs and picked up 95 wickets."
42,"BARCELONA: Tensions around Catalonia’s upcoming independence referendum have spilled onto the soccer pitch in Spain after a warning from the country’s national football league that one of its crown jewels, FC Barcelona, would be expelled if the region seceded.Catalonia is home to the world’s second most-valuable club, with five-times European champions Barca a mainstay of Spain’s La Liga whose boss, Javier Tebas, has said the club would not be allowed to remain in the league in the event of secession.Spain’s football community believes secession is a distant prospect, given that Madrid has declared Sunday’s vote as unconstitutional, but that has not stopped the Catalan political crisis from exposing divisions among fans and some officials.La Liga’s threat to expel Barca in the event of independence would leave the club, estimated by Forbes magazine this year to be worth $3.64 billion, and its players, including five-times world player of the year Lionel Messi, without a league.The region’s other top-flight clubs, Girona and Espanyol, would also face expulsion from Spanish soccer.Barcelona’s Nou Camp stadium is a cauldron of separatist fervour, but the club is careful not to openly support independence. Instead, it says Catalans should decide and has criticised Spain’s attempts to prevent the vote going ahead.After police raided Catalan government offices and arrested officials this month, the club issued a statement condemning “any act that may impede the free exercise” of democracy and freedom of speech.FC Barcelona and La Liga declined to comment to Reuters, though the club’s vice-president, Jordi Cardoner, told reporters this week the vote would be “an important day in the history of our country, but we have to focus on football”.Soccer’s world governing body, FIFA, also declined to comment on the implications for FC Barcelona and other Catalan clubs if the region were to declare independence after the vote, which Spain regards as unconstitutional.“As a general rule FIFA does not comment on potential future scenarios,” a FIFA spokesperson told Reuters.Secession, though, would be a tricky political football for FIFA. If La Liga were to exclude Barcelona in the event of Catalan independence -- a move Tebas said would be required by Spanish law -- FIFA could be asked to determine if Spain had breached its rule against government interference in football.FIFA would have the power to suspend Spain, the 2010 World Cup winners, from competing in international soccer, less than a year before the 2018 tournament in Russia.A soccer crisis could be avoided if the law were to be amended, but most Spanish lawmakers are opposed to Catalan independence and it is not clear if they would approve that.Many Barcelona fans regard independence as paramount, despite the implications for their storied club.“I believe the club should have an even stronger position in favour of the right to decide,” said Carles Ordiales, president of supporters group Seguiment.“Barca and Catalonia have been linked historically and the club should be 100 percent committed to the people of Catalonia.”Barca’s support stretches far beyond Catalonia and Spain, however, and not all supporters back its stance.“I have contradictory sentiments,” said Barca season ticket holder Dam Calderon, also a member of Seguiment.He said he was not a separatist but believed Spain’s efforts to prevent the referendum going ahead were shameful.“I understand the club’s position and why they released their statement. On the other hand, I think about the millions of Barcelona fans who are not separatists, and that might see it differently and feel offended by it.”The coach of Barcelona’s arch-rival Real Madrid said he could not imagine La Liga without its 24-times champions.“I see Barcelona as always being in La Liga and that’s it. I hope that does not happen,” Frenchman Zinedine Zidane said at a pre-game news conference this month.Former Barca president Joan Laporta, who backs independence, shares that sentiment: “Barca versus Real Madrid is a very attractive product and trying to get rid of it would be an error on the part of the government, the league and the soccer federation,” he said on Friday.Even if Spain prevents the Catalan government from staging a credible vote on Sunday, independence supporters among Barca’s fan base are still likely to have something to cheer about.On referendum day, Barcelona play lowly ranked Las Palmas at the Nou Camp and are likely to extend their six-game winning start in La Liga and remain top of the standings.As ever, fans will chant “independence” at precisely 17 minutes and 14 seconds into each half of the game, a tradition marking the 1714 Siege of Barcelona by Spain’s King Felipe V who vanquished the Principality of Catalonia as a political entity."
43,"ABU DHABI: The Abu Dhabi Council on Friday announced free entry into Sheikh Zayed Stadium at the eleventh hour of the first Test cricket match's second day.After officials from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in Abu Dhabi discussed with their local counterparts the low interest of cricket lovers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it was finally decided that the rest of the three days will be free for sports enthusiasts.The decision comes after Abu Dhabi Cricket officials requested the PCB to do so given that fewer than 1,000 spectators came to witness the game during the first and second days of the Test.On the second day too, entry was made free almost an hour before the game ended in order to attract a higher number of fans to Sheikh Zaid Stadium.Shahnawaz Hakim — the manager of operations at Abu Dhabi Cricket — told Geo.tv here that almost 150 people bought tickets for the first day of Pakistan-Sri Lanka Test match, while around 800 tickets were purchased on the second day.Considering how difficult it is to ""attract cricket fans during the Test matches nowadays, I believe that it's quite a good move that will attract cricket fans — especially blue-collar Pakistani workers living in the Emirates,"" Hakeem explained.On the second day, almost 100 Sri Lankan cricket fans witnessed the action at Sheikh Zayed Stadium, raising their national flag and dancing to the beat of the drum.Authorities say that the heat and the absence of star cricketers have led to people's disinterest in the Test. They now hope that the free entry will boost audience numbers on the remaining days."
44,"ISLAMKOT: As Pakistan bets on cheap coal in the Thar desert to resolve its energy crisis, a select group of women is eyeing a road out of poverty by snapping up truck-driving jobs that once only went to men.Such work is seen as life-changing in this dusty southern region bordering India, where sand dunes cover estimated coal reserves of 175 billion tonnes and yellow dumper trucks swarm like bees around Pakistan’s largest open-pit mine.The imposing 60-tonne trucks initially daunted Gulaban, 25, a housewife and mother of three from Thar’s Hindu community inside the mainly-Muslim nation of 208 million people.“At the beginning I was a bit nervous but now it’s normal to drive this dumper,” said Gulaban, clad in a pink saree, a traditional cloth worn by Hindu women across South Asia.Gulaban - who hopes such jobs can help empower other women facing grim employment prospects - is among 30 women being trained to be truck drivers by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), a Pakistani firm digging up low-grade coal under the rolling Thar sand dunes.Gulaban has stolen the march on her fellow trainees because she was the only woman who knew how to drive a car before training to be a truck driver. She is an inspiration to her fellow students.“If Gulaban can drive a dump truck then why not we? All we need to do is learn and drive quickly like her,” said Ramu, 29, a mother of six, standing beside the 40-tonne truck. Until recently, energy experts were uncertain that Pakistan’s abundant but poor-quality coal could be used to fire up power plants.That view began to change with new technology and Chinese investment as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a key branch of Beijing’s Belt and Road initiative to connect Asia with Europe and Africa.Now coal, along with hydro and liquefied natural gas, is at the heart of Pakistan’s energy plans.SECMC, which has about 125 dump trucks ferrying earth out of the pit mine, estimates it will need 300-400 trucks once they burrow deep enough to reach the coal.Drivers can earn up to 40,000 rupees ($380) a month.Women aspiring to these jobs are overcoming cultural barriers in a society where women are restricted to mainly working the fields and cooking and cleaning for the family. Only this week in Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Pakistan, women were granted permission to drive for the first time ever, ending a ban that was supported by conservative clerics but seen by rights activists as an emblem of suppression.Gulaban’s husband, Harjilal, recalled how people in Thar would taunt him when his “illiterate” wife drove their small car.“When I sit in the passenger seat with my wife driving, people used to laugh at me,” said Harjilal, who like most of the people in the community only has one name.But Gulaban, seeking to throw stereotypes out of the window, is only focused on the opportunities ahead. “As I can see our other female trainees getting paid and their life is changing,” Gulaban added. “I hope...for a better future.”"

51,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has confused a lot of English-speakers — though this time not about what he intends with his nuclear program.Responding to US President Donald Trump’s bellicose warning to Pyongyang in his first speech to the United Nations on Tuesday, Kim on Friday called Trump a “dotard” — at least in a translation by the state news agency KCNA.The obscure word is old — late Middle English, or around the 14th century — and means a senile old person, someone in their dotage.Although Shakespeare and Tolkien used it, the word is barely heard these days and Kim’s statement caused a Twitter storm of questions to Merriam-Webster dictionary about its meaning, while searches on Google also increased.Merriam-Webster responded with a tweet, defining dotard as “a person in his or her dotage,” which is “a state or period of senile decay marked by decline of mental poise and alertness”.It quickly became the top trending post on Twitter on Friday, with more than 7,400 retweets and 13,000 likes.There were more than 100,000 mentions of the hashtag #dotard and 189,000 mentions of the word on Twitter on Friday, according to international social media analytics firm Talkwalker.On Google’s Ngram Viewer, which tracks the popularity of words over time, “dotard” was a word that peaked in the 18th century.Many social media users also took to Twitter to deliver their best jokes.“By making people look up the word #dotard, Kim Jong Un has done more for American education than Betsy DeVos,” wrote one user, @TurmUp_TheTweet. DeVos is the US Secretary of Education.Other Twitter influencers did not find the insult amusing.“This hashtag is a disgrace: #DotardTrump,” tweeted LoConservative founder Kassy Dillon. “Whether you like him or not, Trump is your president & Kim Jong Un is a dictator & a murderer.”And novelist Elnathan John said, “Am I the only one who doesn’t find this Trump-Jong Un war dance funny? Why are we all giggling at these two men who CAN destroy us? #dotard.”"

53,"KARACHI: Doctors, politicians, lawyers were among the hundreds who bought fake degrees from the Axact diploma mill.The Axact fake degree scandal engulfed Canada, after investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and an international publication revealed over 800 Canadian citizens purchased fake degrees from the software company.The revelations were made in an article published by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which states that over 800 Canadian citizens purchased fake degrees from Axact.Former FBI agent, Allen Ezell, who was probing the Axact ""diploma mill"" case, said this is just one operation and it does not specify the number of fake degrees sold in Canada on the whole.""All of us can be harmed by any professional that … does not have the full extent of training that his credentials purport that he has,"" Ezell said.According to Ezell the fake degree mill was probably grossing $ 1 billion a year with 35 bank accounts in 19 different countries.Hamid pled guilty on April 6 this year to conspiracy to commit wire fraudIn the regard, the case of Gilbert Correces is very important, who acquired one such Almeda University degree from Axact. Correces was previously a contractor, but he is now a ""psychotherapist"".But the PhD and Correces's alma mater are both fake. Almeda University is affiliated with Axact's international diploma mill scheme, and is not an accredited post-secondary institution.Yasir Jamshaid, a former quality assurance employee of Axact, said 95 per cent of the education customers ""were crooks themselves.""""They knew they're buying something that is not real but they're still going for it. They're not innocent.""Jamshaid said that when he blew the whistle on the software company in early 2015, Axact had by then recovered approximately $600,000 for about 20 customers who he believes were actually deceived.In connection with the scandal, a US court on August 29 sentenced an Axact executive, Umair Hamid, to 21 months in prison and levied a fine of $5,303,020 ""for his role in an international diploma mill scheme operated through the Pakistani company”.""Hamid, 31, of Karachi, Pakistan, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison”, according to a press statement by US Department of Justice in April, this year.He was arrested on Dec 19, 2016, according to a statement by former Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara.

56,"NOTTINGHAM: West Indies coach Stuart Law is looking to the remainder of the one-day international series against England to help him build a settled team ahead of next year´s World Cup qualifying tournament.Defeat in the first ODI at Old Trafford on Tuesday ended West Indies´ hopes of gaining direct entry to the 2019 World Cup in Britain.Instead the two-time champions will now have to come through a qualifying tournament, set to take place in Zimbabwe early next year, if they are to secure a spot in the business end of the showpiece 50-over event.West Indies reached the first three World Cup finals, all staged in England, winning the inaugural edition in 1975 and repeating that achievement in 1979 before suffering a shock defeat by India at Lord´s in the climax of the 1983 edition.But this year saw the Caribbean side fail to qualify for the elite Champions Trophy one-day tournament as they were outside the world´s top eight 50-over teams. So it was no surprise when West Indies missed out on an automatic place at the World Cup.Following a washed-out second ODI at Nottingham´s Trent Bridge on Thursday, Law´s men only have three more matches in England -- starting with Sunday´s fixture in Bristol -- and a three-match ODI series in New Zealand scheduled before the qualifiers.""Our plan is to go to Zimbabwe next year with a settled team, a team where everyone knows their roles and what they want to achieve,"" Law told reporters at Trent Bridge.""It´s a balancing act. I´d like to go to New Zealand with a team which is pretty settled before the qualifiers,"" the former Australia batsman added.Chris Gayle, who suffered a hamstring injury while warming-up at Trent Bridge, and fellow senior batsman Marlon Samuels returned for the limited-overs leg of West Indies´ tour after missing the preceding 2-1 Test series loss.Meanwhile, spinner Sunil Narine could come back into the ODI side as well.Narine was named man-of-the-match in the West Indies´ win over England in the lone Twenty20 international of the tour at Chester-le-Street on Saturday, as they repeated their World Twenty20 final win against the same opponents in Kolkata last year.Narine, however, has said he wants to play domestic one-day cricket before returning at international level -- his last ODI was 11 months ago.""Sunil Narine showed his class in the T20. He stated he wanted to get some 50-over cricket in, which is fair enough, but if he decides he wants to give ODIs a go he´d be one of the first picks with the spin he provides,"" said Law.West Indies could also soon be welcoming back Andre Russell, with the big-hitting all-rounder due to complete a one-year ban for missed drugs tests on January 31, 2018.""Most people would be excited to have a guy like Andre Russell champing at the bit to play international cricket,"" Law said.But Law is aware of the need to steer a path between recalling star names and backing the current squad.""It´s a balancing act because what some players bring is extraordinary and you don´t want to nullify that effect,"" he said.Law added: ""We´ve still got some selectorial conversations to have, to understand if we have the best players to take this team forward.""This group I feel has a lot of good, that´s why they are here."""

Chishti’s father left Pakistan and became an Imam in the UK after General Ziaul Haq staged a military coup and hanged Bhutto. Rehman Chishti came to the UK at the age of six and since then has lived in Gillingham and Rainham. He was close to former prime minister David Cameron and enjoys good relations with PM Theresa May. Within the Conservative Party, Rehman Chishti is seen as a rising star."
59,"LONDON: Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Barjees Tahir has said that minus-Nawaz formula will never be acceptable to the workers of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the people of Pakistan and those wishing for it should learn lessons from history.Barjees Tahir visited London for two days to meet the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who has been here for over three weeks now. On Friday, Barjees Tahir met the former premier at Hasan Nawaz Sharif’s office for an hour and exchanged views with him. Barjees Tahir’s son Sakib Barjees and the PML-N UK’s senior vice president Nasir Butt were also present in the meeting.Speaking after the meeting, Barjees Tahir said he inquired about the health of Begum Kulsoom Nawaz from Nawaz Sharif and conveyed him the message of his supporters that they are devoted to him and have full faith in him.Barjees Tahir said: “Begum Kulsoom Nawaz is a role model for Pakistan’s political activists. She stood gallantly against the dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf and suffered a great deal, she is a democracy icon because she fought for democracy and was persecuted for it. We all have huge respect for what she did for the restoration of democracy in the worst of times. I have come to London to pay homage to her role, I remember how she inspired us all not to be scared off by the persecution we all faced from Pervez Musharraf.”Barjees Tahir said it’s a known fact now that Nawaz Sharif has been disqualified out of revenge and what happened in the name of accountability is the mockery of justice. “Nawaz Sharif stands vindicated in the eyes of Pakistani people. So much fuss was created about the Panama case to oust Nawaz Sharif but nothing was found against him in the Supreme Court. There is not even an allegation of corruption of public funds. He has been ousted on the basis of an Iqama and that has humiliated the respect of vote and democracy has been insulted. Supporters of Nawaz Sharif are fully aware that their leader is sadiq and ameen and that what happened to him is an injustice.”Barjees Tahir said billion of Rupees have been wiped off Pakistan’s stock market and Pakistan’s economy has suffered after the ouster of Nawaz Sharif. “The whole world knows that Nawaz Sharif had put Pakistan’s economy on the right track. His ouster has dented faith of the international community, the fact is Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification on weak grounds has destabilised Pakistan. This is not something that Pakistan needs.”Barjeez Tahir said Nawaz Sharif is loved by Kashmiris because he has always been there for them. “Nawaz Sharif enjoys popularity amongst Kashmiris because not only that he is a Kashmiri himself, he has worked for their rights and welfare, for the independence of Kashmir. This love was reflected during the last general elections in Azad Kashmir when Muslim league swept polls in the name of Nawaz Sharif. Kashmiris voted for him because they know he’s their man. I meet Kashmiris on daily basis and they are heart-broken that their leader has been ousted out of revenge, I passed their love and wishes to Nawaz Sharif in our meeting.”"

He has also represented Pakistan in three ODIs.About Yasir Shah, Inzamam said the spinner would prove to be ideal in UAE conditions.“Yasir Shah has been our best bowler over the recent years,” he said.Young spinner Shadab Khan and veteran all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez were omitted from the squad.

67,"As far as media hype went, the recent by-election in the NA-120 constituency received the same kind of rolling TV coverage that national elections would. The hype didn’t already exist, it was built up - largely by the ruling party.For the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz the by-polls were a matter of political existence or demise, or at least that is how they portrayed it. A defeat on September 17, could have spelt defeat in 2018.On the day of the by-polls, leaders of the PML-N were visibly shaken.Preliminary and unofficial results put Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf’s Yasmin Rashid in the lead. She was ahead by 2,000 votes, when I received a call from a federal minister. “This is not possible,” he said, “How can this be? Our blood pressure has shot up in the last one hour.” I am guessing his blood pressure finally settled, later that night, after Kulsoom Nawaz’s votes picked up, leading her to win.From the start, the PML-N was a sure shot to win the polls in their home constituency. Yet, PTI gave it it's all. They needed a good showing in NA-120 to walk confidently into the 2018 general elections. PTI’s chief, Imran Khan, himself appeared for a gathering on the border of the constituency and also lead a rally to the Data Darbar.According to official results, PTI polled six per cent less than in 2017 compared to 2013, while the PML-N polled 13 per cent less. Now, by-elections are usually uninteresting for voters, hence the turnout is below average. Both candidates witnessed a slump in their vote count slump, but there was a greater dent in the PML-N vote bank.The PML-N’s tone even after the win has remained accusatory. It has dubbed the vote drop as a conspiracy by invisible forces. Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the party’s heir apparent, went so far as to claim that her workers were abducted a night before the polling. Others complain that banned organizations were allowed to organize themselves and contest the elections against Nawaz’s party. Banned organizations have become mainstream because they have been allowed the space to organize their political and charitable front. For that, the PML-N has only itself to blame. It should instead hold the Interior Ministers, both from its party, Chaudhry Nisar and Ahsan Iqbal, accountable.If the PML-N truly believes that 12,000 of its voters were stopped from casting their ballot in NA-120, then that is a cause for concern. In the 2013 elections, there were 16 constituencies from where PML-N lost with a very narrow margin. Take, NA-104. Here Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain’s brother Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain lost to Nawaz’s party by a margin of only 3,800 votes. In NA-122 by-election, PML-N’s Ayaz Sadiq won with a lead of only 2,500 votes. In NA-164, PMLN’s Rai Mansab Ali won with 3,200 votes; NA-57 PML-N’s Sheikh Aftab Ahmed got 3, 900 votes more than the opposing candidate and in NA-41 PML-N’s Ghalib Khan won with a lead of 1,100.The PML-N forayed into this election worried only about rival PTI. It should have been equally concerned about the banned organizations that formed political wings only last year, and yet managed to frazzle the ruling party.The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."
68,"LONDON: An accountability court has asked Pakistan High Commission (PHC) to serve bailable arrest warrants to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s children and his son-in-law Captain Safdar at the Avenfield apartments, but none other than Hasan Nawaz lives at the mentioned address making it impossible for the summons to be served in the correct manner.Maryam Nawaz, Hussain Nawaz, Asma Nawaz and Captain Safdar are living at a separate location and are not at the Avenfield apartments. Nawaz Sharif stays with Hasan when in London while others in the family visit Avenfield block regularly and its believed that the whole family stays at this address. Hence, the accountability court sent summons to this address. It has created problems for the PHC which can present the summons for Hasan Nawaz to his porter who manages the reception of Avenfield block but PHC officials have no clue where Maryam, Hussain and others are currently staying.It can be confirmed that out of the four apartments mentioned in the Panama Papers, only Hasan Nawaz’s flat is suitable for accommodation while the other three flats are undergoing maintenance work and are not suitable for lodging. A source said that Hussain, Maryam and Safdar have been staying at rented accommodation nearby to be close to Kulsoom Nawaz..There is not enough space in Hasan Nawaz’s four bedroom apartment to accommodate his siblings and relatives, hence two flats have been rented nearby to accommodate family and relatives. Begum Kulsoom Nawaz has been staying with Hasan since she reached London for treatment and is attended by a doctor and an assistant round the clock while staying at this address.A source confirmed that bailable arrest warrants for Hassan, Hussain, Maryam and Safdar were sent through “fax and parcel” three days ago and officials of PHC have confirmed the “receipt” to the Foreign Office of Pakistan.The source said two copies of the warrants for each accused had been received at the high commission. The source said that the high commission delivered the summons and legal notices at Avenfield apartments during the Panama case hearings and the same method was used by Wajid Zia’s cousin Akhtar Raja who sent letters to Hasan and Hussain Nawaz on the same address. A PHC spokesman refused to comment when asked if the arrest warrants have been served to the concerned individuals or not.Nawaz Sharif appeared before the NAB court on Wednesday but Geo News had reported on Saturday, prior to Nawaz Sharif’s departure, that his children will not become part of the accountability proceedings while Nawaz Sharif will seek an exemption from his appearance.The NAB court has announced to indict the ex-premier on October 2 in cases pertaining to Avenfiled apartments and Azizia Steel Mills against the Sharif family. The accountability court in Islamabad on Tuesday summoned Maryam Nawaz, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Nawaz and Captain (R) Mohammad Safdar to appear before the court on October 2 but it’s understood that none will appear before the NAB court because the Sharif family and its supporters say that Nawaz Sharif is being victimised and that he failed to get fair trial at the Supreme Court."
69,"ABU DHABI: Captain Dinesh Chandimal made an unbeaten 155 as Sri Lanka put the pressure on Pakistan on the second day of the first Test in Abu Dhabi on Friday.Openers Sami Aslam (31 not out) and Shan Masood (30 not out) negotiated 23 overs to take Pakistan to 64-0, still trailing Sri Lanka´s first-innings total of 419 by 355 runs.They need another 156 to avoid the follow-on, a task which should be simple on a flat Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch.Both Masood and Aslam, opening for the first time together, looked assured as Sri Lanka attacked through all their three spinners and two seamers in short spells.But it was a memorable day for Sri Lankan skipper Chandimal, whose marathon knock of over nine hours in hot conditions propelled his team to a strong total.He came in to bat with his team in trouble at 61-3 on Thursday, but led the fightback in a fourth-wicket stand of 100 with Dimuth Karunaratne (93).On Friday, after Sri Lanka resumed at 227-4, Chandimal added 134 for the fifth wicket with Niroshan Dickwella (83) and another 92 for the sixth with Dilruwan Perera, who made 33.Chandimal faced 372 balls and struck 14 boundaries to leave Pakistan toiling for wickets, before the tail succumbed to some good pace bowling by Mohammad Abbas, who took 3-75.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah finished with 3-120 in a marathon 57 overs of hard work.The Chandimal-Dickwella stand was only broken in the 22nd over of the day when Dickwella played on to fast bowler Hasan Ali, spurning a good chance to post his maiden Test hundred.Dickwella hit nine boundaries and a six during his rapid 117-ball knock and bettered his previous best Test effort of 81, made against Zimbabwe in Colombo earlier this year.Chandimal reached his ninth Test century - his first in four matches as captain, and first against Pakistan - by driving left-arm paceman Mohammad Amir through the covers for his 11th boundary.Pakistan's misery was compounded as they did get Perera twice on nought, but the all-rounder made successful reviews on both decisions -- once each off Shah and Haris Sohail.Perera also survived a stumping decision before finally falling to part-timer Sohail for his first wicket.Shah then had Rangana Herath for four before Abbas took the wickets of Lakshan Sundakan (eight) and Nuwan Pradeep (nought) from successive deliveries. Yasir is the joint-second fastest bowler to reach 150 Test wickets along with Waqar YounisOn Thursday, Yasir Shah matched fellow countryman Waqar Younis as the joint second fastest to 150 wickets - both achieving the milestone in their 27th Test.Australia's Sydney Barnes holds the record after reaching the landmark in just 24 Tests.The Test is Pakistan's first since the retirement of legendary batsman Younis Khan and their most successful Test skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq.Pakistan handed a Test cap to batsman Haris Sohail, while Sri Lanka went into the game with three spinners and two seamers."

Violations will be punished with a fine of up to 150 euros ($177).Starting in October, people wearing garments in public that cover a woman's face will be subject to fines of 150 euros""Acceptance and respect of Austrian values are basic conditions for successful cohabitation between the majority Austrian population and people from third countries living in Austria,"" Vienna says.The measures, similar to those in other European Union countries, also apply to visitors even though large numbers of Arab tourists holiday in the Alpine country.The legislation was brought in by the outgoing centrist government of Chancellor Christian Kern.Elections on October 15 are expected to see the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPOe) come second or third and potentially enter a coalition with Sebastian Kurz of the centre-right.Kurz, who is only 31, has managed to steal considerable numbers of voters from the FPOe, polls show, experts say in part due to him moving to the right on issues such as immigration.""The immigration seen in recent years is changing our country not in a positive but in a negative way,"" Kurz told German television in an interview broadcast this week.Other measures to apply from October 1 include immigrants signing an ""integration contract"" and compulsory courses in the German language and ""values""."
72,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.75 percent on the back of continued momentum in economic growth and contained inflation rate.Announcing its monetary policy after a committee meeting headed by Governor SBP Tariq Bajwa on Friday, the central bank said GDP growth was poised to reach its target of 6.0 percent for fiscal year 2018, backed by ""an upbeat industrial outlook and a promising assessment of major crops"".""Macroeconomic environment remains conducive to growth without impacting headline inflation. Favorable initial estimates of major crops, a healthy growth in credit to private sector and growing productive imports all indicate solid gains in the real sector,"" said the central bank in its monetary policy statement. “Based on current projections of agriculture sector growth, GDP growth is likely to reach the annual target of 6.0 percent for FY18 leading to an improved capacity to accommodate rising domestic demand,"" it said. The State Bank also forecast that inflation would remain well below its target of 6.0 percent for fiscal year 2018.""Core inflation (non-food-non-energy), reflecting the underlying demand pressures in the economy, continues to maintain its higher level of 5.6 percent in the initial two months of the fiscal year. This is also visible from IBA-SBP's Consumer Confidence Survey of September 2017, which shows a modest rise in expected inflation during the next six months,"" it added. It said that manufacturing activity was expected to benefit from higher development spending, growing investments in projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, improvement in the country's security condition, and the continued trend of stable and low cost of borrowing. The central Bank also gave an optimistic assessment for the tertiary sector, saying ""an upbeat industrial outlook and a promising assessment of major crops are going to have positive spillovers on the services sector"" as well. However, the State Bank cautioned that higher growth activity had also resulted in complementary external sector pressures on the economy. ""The current account deficit for the first two months of FY18 has widened to US$ 2.6 billion. This is primarily driven by higher imports of productive goods, especially of machinery, metal and petroleum products. The increase in import of these three groups was strong enough to offset the combined impact of healthy growth in exports and workers' remittances during Jul-Aug FY18,"" it said. Foreign direct investment recorded net inflows of US$ 456 million in Jul-Aug FY18, more than double the level of inflows in the corresponding period last year. ""This, together with other financial flows, was however not enough to manage the higher current account deficit.""The central bank said exports presented an encouraging picture compared with information in July 2017.""Going forward, there are anticipations of gain in exports on account of favorable global economic conditions, improvement in domestic energy supplies, and incentives given to exporting industry,"" said the central bank. But it cautioned that imports were also expected to rise due to ongoing CPEC-related investments and domestic economic activities.""Amid declining number of workers proceeding abroad there are prospects of sluggish growth in workers' remittances. Hence, an improvement in the country's external account and its foreign exchange reserve relies upon timely realization of official financial inflows along with thoughtful adoption of structural reforms to improve trade competitiveness in the medium term,"" it recommended. "

77,"BAGHDAD: Iraqi forces Friday launched an assault on the northern town of Hawija, one of the last bastions in the country still held by Daesh, which is also under attack in neighbouring Syria.The operation came after Daesh released what it said was an audio recording of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urging resistance, the first such intervention in nearly a year.""The leaders of the Islamic State and its soldiers have realised that the path to... victory is to be patient and resist the infidels whatever their alliances,"" said the voice in the recording, whose authenticity Washington said it had ""no reason to doubt"".Since Baghdadi's previous message to his followers last November, the territory the militants still hold in the cross-border caliphate they proclaimed in 2014 has shrunk to a fraction of its former extent.""A huge military operation has begun to liberate Hawija and its surrounding areas,"" the operation's commander, Lieutenant General Abdel Amir Yarallah, said in a statement.Iraqi forces launched an offensive to retake the militant enclave around Hawija on September 21, swiftly taking the town of Sharqat on its second day before pushing on towards Hawija itself.Yarallah said that Friday's assault marked the second phase of the operation and aimed to recapture Hawija and the towns of Al-Abbasi, Riyadh and Rashad to its west, east and south.All are mainly Sunni Arab towns that have long been bastions of insurgency and were bypassed by government forces in their push north on second city Mosul last year which culminated in the militant's defeat in their most emblematic stronghold this July.Yarallah later announced that troops had taken Al-Abbasi and raised the Iraqi flag there.He said the operation involved the army, the federal police, counterterrorism units and the Rapid Intervention Force, as well as tribal volunteers and the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation force.The enclave lies east of the Tigris River and south of one of its major tributaries, the Little Zab, and troops erected pontoon bridges during the night to enable the assault to begin, Yarallah said.The Popular Mobilisation force said that Daesh had set fire to two oil wells in the Alas field, southeast of Hawija, in a bid to provide cover and slow the advance of loyalist forces.Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi hailed the second phase of the operation to recapture the area.""As we promised the sons of our country, we are going to liberate every inch of Iraqi land and crush the Daesh terrorist gangs,"" Abadi said.""We are on the verge of a new victory to liberate the residents of these areas from those criminals.""The Hawija enclave is one of just two areas of Iraq still held by Daesh, along with a stretch of the Euphrates Valley near the Syrian border which is under attack too.Further up the Euphrates Valley on the Syrian side of the border, Daesh is facing rival offensives by US-backed fighters and Russian-backed government forces.The militants launched a major counteroffensive against government forces on Thursday, killing at least 73 troops and militia in a series of attacks along their supply lines, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.Most of the dead came near the desert town of Sukhna, on the main highway between the big cities of the west and Euphrates Valley city of Deir Ezzor, the Britain-based monitoring group said.Syrian troops pushed through the desert and broke a three-year Daesh siege of government enclaves in Deir Ez Zor earlier this month. They are now battling to retake the rest of it.Further upstream, a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters is poised to capture the onetime Daesh bastion of Raqa, once a byword for militant atrocities.A top US-led coalition commander told AFP on Thursday that the jihadists were now breathing their ""last gasps"" in the city.He said the coalition was already setting its sights on another Daesh-held town in the Euphrates Valley - Al-Mayadeen, between Deir Ezzor and the Iraqi border."

Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which swells lymph nodes and can be treated with antibiotics.But the more dangerous pneumonic form invades the lungs and can kill a person within 24 hours if not treated. About half of the 104 known cases are pneumonic, the WHO said.WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva that areas affected included the capital Antananarivo and the port cities of Mahajenga and Toamasina.The U.N. health agency said it feared that the outbreak could worsen because the season for plague, which is endemic in Madagascar, had only just begun, and runs until April. On average, 400 cases are reported each year.“The overall risk of further spread at the national level is high,” WHO said in a statement."

86,"KARACHI: Dismissed reserve policemen and unpaid teachers clashed with police at the Karachi Press Club in the Saddar area of the metropolis on Tuesday.During the clashes, police arrested a number of protestors. Teachers were protesting unpaid salary duesThe protestors were trying to march onto the high-security Red Zone, where the Chief Minister's House is located, to protest and present their demands. Barred from doing so, police and the protesting teachers skirmished, with the police baton charging and using water cannons to disperse the crowd. A number of minor injuries were reported from the clash and some protestors were also arrested. The protestors threw stones and glass bottles at the riot police deployed to control the situation, following which police pushed the protestors back with the help of a water cannon. The teachers claimed that they had been protesting for the past two days for their salaries, but were yet to be contacted by any government official. On July 25, around 300 government school teachers renewed their demand for salaries outside KPC.A similar protest was held earlier as well, which ended in front of Sindh Assembly on June 5, the same day the provincial budget was announced.The protest ended after Secretary of School Education Abdul Aziz Uqaili assured the protesters that their problems will be resolved within a week.Teachers across the provinces have been protesting non-payment of salaries for the last five years. "
87,"LONDON: Police have identified one of the suspects being held in connection with the Parsons Green bombing as 21-year-old Syrian refugee Yahyah Farroukh.Farroukh was arrested on Saturday close to midnight in West London, according to The Sun. He was arrested under Britain’s Terrorism Act. The arrest was made after CCTV footage showed one of the suspects preparing form the London Tube bombing was broadcast on British TV. Earlier, police arrested an 18-year-old man in relation to the London train bombing that injured 30 people.He was also arrested under the Terrorism Act in the southern port area of Dover.Four previous attacks in London and Manchester this year claimed the lives of 35 people.A home-made bomb on a packed rush-hour commuter train in London engulfed a carriage in flames and injured 29 people on Friday, but apparently failed to fully explode, in Britain’s fifth major terrorism incident this year.Some suffered burns and others were injured in a stampede to escape the station — one of the above-ground stops on the underground “Tube” network — but health officials said none were thought to be in a serious condition."
88,"NEW DELHI: Alphabet Inc’s Google on Monday launched a localized payments app for India as it tries to gain a foothold in the country’s rapidly-growing digital payments space.India’s crowded digital payments market, expected to grow ten-fold to $500 billion by 2020, received a shot in the arm after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned old high-value notes last year, forcing people to use e-wallets and card payments.A state-backed payments system, Unified Payment Interface (UPI), has also helped banks enter the fray, forcing wallet players to actively partner with lenders or adopt the platform in the world’s fastest growing internet services market.Google’s payments app named Tez, meaning fast in Hindi, uses UPI and allows users to connect their bank accounts to the service. Google has partnered with State Bank of India, the country’s biggest lender, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank for the service.Tez will compete, among others, with Paytm which is backed by SoftBank and Alibaba. Paytm is the country’s largest e-wallet with more than 225 million users.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley who launched Tez in New Delhi said Google was keen on joining India’s transformation into a digital economy, especially after the demonetization.“The Google team was extremely keen because they saw a great potential, both in the economy and the businesses in India.”Google has increasingly stepped up its efforts to reach deeper into the Indian market. It provides free wifi at several railways stations across the country and launched a version of its video platform YouTube that runs on a slower network.Bharti Enterprises-backed Hike launched a UPI-linked wallet within its messaging platform earlier this year, while Facebook’s popular WhatsApp instant messaging service is also mulling foraying into digital payment services in India, its biggest market and home to 200 million of its billion-plus users."
89,"NOWSHERA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-Chairman and former president Asif Ali Zardari on Monday said efforts were being made to weaken the PPP but the party was not afraid as it has always preached democracy.“The PPP is a federation party with its presence in all four provinces,” the former president said while addressing a workers convention in Nowshera. “Efforts are being made to weaken our party but we are not afraid [to face this] because we preach love and democracy.”The former president also claimed that he understands the nation’s pain better than all other [political opponents].Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) should not lose hope, he said, adding that the PPP will combine the powers of the province with its own strength to bring an end to all of KP’s issues. Earlier in the day, Zardari had said that he had told former prime minister Nawaz Sharif that he would do politics not in the first four years of the government but in the final year before General Elections 2018.The former president addressed a crowd in Peshawar, also speaking about the recent by-polls in Lahore’s NA-120, where Kulsoom Nawaz emerged victorious.“I don’t see the establishment backing me up,” said Zardari, adding that he sees a ‘Jiyala’ at his back.“If you listen to Maryam Nawaz’s statements following the victory, there is a lot to observe,” he remarked.Zardari said that if Nawaz intended to implement Charter of Democracy back in the day, then the PPP workers wouldn’t have languished in jails.“I had warned them not to be royalty but they turned into kings and princes,” said the former president mocking the PML-N leadership.During Zardari’s speech, the workers got unruly and chanted slogans against the party leadership.The workers reportedly had a grievance that the PPP co-chairman did not meet them.The former president’s address came a day after the hotly-contested NA-120 by-elections, where PML-N candidate and former PM Nawaz’s wife secured the seat from her party’s stronghold."
90,"COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh: Rohingya Muslims fleeing a Myanmar military offensive arrived in Bangladesh on Monday with fresh accounts of violence and arson as a rights group called for sanctions and an arms embargo to stop what the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing.The latest wave of violence in western Myanmar's Rakhine State began on Aug 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people.The Myanmar military response has sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, escaping what they and rights monitors say is a campaign aimed at driving out the Muslim population.Buddhist-majority Myanmar rejects that, saying its forces are carrying out clearance operations against the insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which claimed responsibility for the August attacks and smaller raids in October.Hundreds of refugees traveled by small boats to an island on the southernmost point of Bangladesh late on Sunday and on Monday, telling of persecution and destruction.""The army came and they burned our homes, they killed our people. There was a mob of Rakhine people too,"" said Usman Goni, 55, after he stepped off a boat with his seven children and wife, clutching two sticks tied in rope and a sack.Many of the refugees have spoken of ethnic Rakhine Buddhist civilians joining the Myanmar army in its attacks. Myanmar denies that and has blamed Muslim insurgents for the violence.Myanmar has largely sealed the area off to aid workers and reporters.Rights groups say satellite images show about 80 smouldering Muslim villages. They have seen evidence of arson attacks on Buddhist villagers, but on a much smaller scale.Most of the new arrivals said their villages had been torched on Friday, when huge clouds of smoke were clearly seen over Myanmar.""There's nothing left,"" said a Nurhaba, 23, who said she was from a village close to Maungdaw town.About a million Rohingya lived in Rakhine State until the recent violence. Most face draconian travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many Buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Myanmar government leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced a barrage of criticism from abroad for not stopping the violence.The military remains in charge of security and there is little sympathy for the Rohingya in a country where the end of army rule has unleashed old animosities. The military campaign in Rakhine State has wide support.Suu Kyi is due to speak to the nation on Tuesday about a crisis the United States has called a ""defining moment"" for her country.US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy is due in Myanmar this week.He will travel to Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, to meet government officials and representatives of different communities, including Rohingya, but he is not seeking to travel to the conflict zone in northern Rakhine State.Human Rights Watch said Myanmar security forces were disregarding world condemnation and the time had come to impose tougher measures that the generals could not ignore.It called for governments to ""impose travel bans and asset freezes on security officials implicated in serious abuses; expand existing arms embargoes to include all military sales, assistance, and cooperation; and place a ban on financial transactions with key ... military-owned enterprises"".For years, the United States and Western allies imposed sanctions on Myanmar in support of Suu Kyi's campaign for democracy. Its response was to forge closer ties with China.US-Myanmar ties have been improving since the military began withdrawing from the government in 2011, and paved the way for a 2015 election won by Suu Kyi's party.A Trump administration official said the violence made it harder to build warmer ties, and there would likely be some ""easing"" in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions.""People are too invested in the last five years of thawing, which is understood by everyone to be strategically sound,"" said the official, who declined to be identified.""Long-term, the trajectory is probably tighter relations.""In a rare expression of support for the Rohingya from within Myanmar, a group from the Karen ethnic minority, called for the military to halt its operations and for economic sanctions to be considered.For decades of army battled autonomy-seeking Karen insurgents that sent more than 100,000 villagers fleeing to Thailand. The insurgents have now made peace.Bangladesh is struggling to cope with the refugees and aid workers fear people could die due to a lack of food, shelter and water, given the numbers.Bangladesh has said all refugees must go home. Myanmar has said it will take back those who can verify their citizenship.Several thousand protesters tried to march on the Myanmar embassy in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, but police kept them well back."
91,"LAHORE: Police on Tuesday claimed to have foiled an assassination plot targeting Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif, sources informed Geo News. A suspected terrorist was arrested from the Model Town area of the provincial capital by security agencies. Police claimed the suspect was working as a driver in a house located in Block H of Model Town and was employed by an officer of PITB.The offices of PITB are located in Arfa Karim Tower, near which a bombing on July 26 claimed the lives of 26 people.An investigation has revealed that the July 26 bombing was also meant to target the chief minister. Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah also confirmed the arrest of a suspect by security agencies. A suicide jacket was also recovered from the suspect's possession, added sources.Earlier today, two suspected terrorists were killed in a raid by the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Chak 23 of Jalalpur Pirwala.According to CTD officials, information was received that a suspected terrorist, Ijaz Asghar, along with five associates, was hiding in the area. As the CTD officials reached the site to nab the suspects, an exchange of fire took place in which two suspected terrorists were killed, while others escaped. The most high-profile assassination to target a member of the provincial government took place in August 2015, when Punjab Home Minister Col (r) Shuja Khanzada was among at least 19 people killed when suicide bombers attacked the political office of the retired colonel in his native village in Attock district.A jirga (open court) was underway at Khanzada’s political office in his native Shadi Khan village when the suicide attackers detonated their explosives. The blast caused the roof of the building to collapse under which the provincial home minister was trapped for several hours. "
92,"ISLAMABAD: The Swiss Ambassador to Pakistan, Thomas Kolly, was summoned by the Foreign Office in Islamabad on Monday, to lodge a protest over an anti-Pakistan advertisement campaign in Geneva.Pakistan has said that Switzerland should not let its territory be used against another sovereign country and such acts are against international law. Drawing the attention of the Swiss Government to the issue, Pakistan's Permanent Mission to United Nations at Geneva demanded the Swiss government to take strict actions against those involved in the campaign.Ambassador Farukh Amil, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations (UN), in a letter has requested the Swiss authorities to take action against those using Swiss soil to further the propaganda against Pakistan.Amil, in the letter, wrote that the posters used in the campaign have been sponsored by an organisation called Balochistan House and added that Balochistan Liberation Army is behind the act. He further said that Pakistan, the United Kingdom and other countries have declared the BLA as a terrorist organisation and the US State Department has termed the activities of the group as terrorist acts. ""BLA and Balochistan House's leadership has committed many crimes against security forces and civilians in Pakistan,"" said the letter. Amil demanded that investigations should be conducted to ensure that the propaganda is blocked permanently. He expressed hope that the Swiss authorities will proceed against the local accomplices of the BLA, who lend support to the terrorist group. "
93,"RAWALPINDI: A delegation of defence committees from the Senate and the National Assembly visited the General Headquarters on Monday, said a statement released by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).The delegation also held a session with Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa.The lawmakers were given a detailed briefing on the evolving security situation, including the situation on the country's borders.The delegation was led by Senator Lt Gen (retd) Abdul Qayyum, and also laid a wreath at the Martyr's monument.The session concluded with a resolve to continue the struggle against the menace of violent extremism through a synergetic national approach based on the principle of “collective potential and shared responsibility”, added the ISPR. "
94,"KARACHI: The arrangements, including that of security, made by the local administration in Lahore and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for the three-match Independence Cup series between Pakistan and World XI have received a thumbs up from former South Africa Cricketer Hashim Amla.Hashim was one of five South African cricketers who came to Pakistan with the World XI squad, led by his Protea captain Faf du Plessis. The South African batsman says hospitality in Pakistan made him feel at home during his stay in the country.“It was great. The people [in Pakistan] were so welcoming and really made the World XI team feel at home,” Amla told Geo.tv in an interview conducted via e-mail.The 34-year old South African cricketer added that they were briefed before they arrived.“That’s when we understood how much planning had gone into this event to give it the best chance of succeeding,” Amla added while expressing his satisfaction with arrangements made by PCB for the series.The South African run-machine, who has an experience of 107 Tests and 156 ODIs, termed the World XI series as “big effort” by PCB in an attempt to restore international cricket in Pakistan.“Our experience has been a good one,” he said when this correspondent asked him about the message to the international community.“Slowly with time the confidence will build again. The PCB made a big effort and if they continue to do so then things will only improve,” added the South African legend.Hashim Amla also talked about his association with the Qalandars franchise in South Africa’s T20 Global League, which is set to commence this November and said that he’s amazed at the passion and vision of the franchise owners.“I didn't know what to expect when the owners were announced and to be honest I have been amazed by their vision and passion,” he said.“I am quite excited and look forward to the selfless and fearless ethos which is the backbone of the franchise,” Amla added.He also praised the Rising Stars program by Qalandars’ PSL team Lahore Qalandars.“Simply astonished at the bravery to even conduct a talent search and social program of that magnitude,” he said, adding the expression of “wow” while commenting on the program which last year featured 113,000 participants and this year the number of aspiring Qalandars has increased from the last edition.However, Amla said that he’s not likely to be available for Pakistan Super League’s season three early next year as he’ll be busy playing Test cricket for his country.“It is unlikely as we have Test matches planned during that time next year. If at a later stage I am free and the opportunity arises then why not,” he concluded."
95,"CHAMAN: At least one person was killed and 22, including security personnel, were injured in a blast near the Pak-Afghan border in Chaman on Monday.According to reports, the blast targeted a vehicle of security forces near a border taxi stand.Levies sources said the explosion was a suicide attack. The Pak-Afghan border was closed and the area was sealed by security forces soon after the incident. The injured have been shifted to District Headquarter Hospital Chaman, Levies sources said five of the injured were shifted to a private hospital. Chief Minister (CM) Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri issued a statement condemning the blast. He expressed regret at the loss of life and issued orders to provide the best possible medical care to the injured.""Those involved in planning and executing the explosion must be immediately arrested and brought to justice,"" the CM said. "
96,"Pressure grew on Myanmar Monday as a rights group urged world leaders to impose sanctions on its military, which is accused of driving out more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims in an orchestrated ""ethnic cleansing"" campaign.The call from Human Rights Watch came as the UN General Assembly prepared to convene in New York, with the crisis in Myanmar high on the agenda.It also came on the eve of a highly-anticipated national address Tuesday by Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, her first on the crisis in Rakhine state.The exodus of Rohingya refugees from mainly Buddhist Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh has sparked a humanitarian emergency. Aid groups are struggling to provide relief to a daily stream of new arrivals, more than half of whom are children.Myanmar has suggested it will not take back all who had fled across the border, accusing them of links to the Rohingya militants whose raids on police posts in August triggered the army backlash.Any clear moves to block the refugees' return will likely anger Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. She will use the General Assembly to press Myanmar to take back all the Rohingya massing in shanty towns and camps in Bangladesh near the border.Human Rights Watch also called for the ""safe and voluntary return"" of the displaced as it urged governments around the globe to punish Myanmar's army with sanctions for the ""ongoing atrocities"" against the Rohingya.""The United Nations Security Council and concerned countries should impose targeted sanctions and an arms embargo on the Burmese military to end its ethnic cleansing campaign against Rohingya Muslims,"" the group said in a statement.Myanmar's military was hit with Western sanctions during its 50-year rule of the country. But most have been lifted in recent years as the generals have allowed a partial transition to democracy.""Burma's senior military commanders are more likely to heed the calls of the international community if they are suffering real economic consequences,"" said John Sifton, HRW's Asia advocacy director.Nobel peace laureate Suu Kyi has shocked the international community with her near-silence on the plight of the Rohingya and her failure to condemn the actions of the army, with whom she has a delicate power-sharing arrangement.Speaking to the BBC over the weekend, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Suu Kyi had a ""last chance"" to stop the humanitarian calamity.But analysts say it will be difficult for her to appease both global outrage and combustible religious tensions at home, where there is broad support among the mainly Buddhist population for the army's crackdown.""I'm worried that there is almost no possibility given the political climate in Myanmar for balancing the expectations of most of the country and the expectations of the international community,"" Richard Horsey, an independent analyst based in Myanmar, told AFP.The sharp divide was on display Monday as protests broke out in Dhaka - where 20,000 people marched in solidarity with the Rohingya - and in Yangon, where a group of 300 gathered to blast global interference in the conflict.While the world has watched with horror, there is little sympathy for the Rohingya inside Myanmar.Many Buddhists revile the Muslim minority and have long denied their existence as an ethnic group, insisting they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.Suu Kyi's government has so far defended the military campaign as a legitimate crackdown on the Rohingya militants, who first emerged as a fighting force last October.On Sunday Myanmar's Information Committee accused those who fled to Bangladesh - more than a third of the Rohingya population - of working in cahoots with the Rohingya militants, a rag-tag group of fighters armed with mostly rudimentary weapons.""Those who fled the villages made their way to the other country for fear of being arrested as they got involved in the violent attacks,"" the statement said.""Legal protection will be given to the villages whose residents did not flee,"" it added.The violence has gutted large swathes of northern Rakhine in just over three weeks, with fires visible almost daily across the border from the Bangladesh camps.Some 30,000 ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Hindus have also been displaced by unrest in northern Rakhine, where foreign aid has been severely curtailed.On Monday, Doctors Without Borders repeated calls for ""unfettered access"" to the conflict zone, saying hundreds of thousands of people are thought to be languishing ""without any meaningful form of humanitarian assistance""."
97,"Pop star Lady Gaga has called off the entire European leg of her world tour because of ""severe physical pain"", her promoters said Monday.The US singer revealed last week that she has fibromyalgia, a chronic illness which can cause pain all over the body.The 18-city European arm of her ""Joanne"" tour, which has been postponed until early 2018, was to begin in Barcelona on Thursday, before shows across the continent, including in Milan, Amsterdam, Paris and five in the UK.Her promoters Live Nation said the agony she was experiencing had ""impacted her ability to perform"".""She remains under the care of expert medical professionals who recommended the postponement earlier today. Lady Gaga is devastated,"" Live Nation said in a statement.""She plans to spend the next seven weeks proactively working with her doctors to heal from this and past traumas that still affect her daily life, and result in severe physical pain in her body,"" it said.""She wants to give her fans the best version of the show she built for them when the tour resumes.""The 31-year-old singer, known for her spectacular live shows, had already cancelled a concert in Rio de Janeiro last week after being hospitalised for ""severe pain"".She also had to pull out of a show in Montreal earlier this month.On Thursday she told her 70 million followers on Twitter that she was suffering from fibromyalgia, having previously acknowledged living with chronic pain since she was 18.Last year she disclosed on social media some of the ways she deals with pain, from infrared saunas to ice baths.The exact causes of fibromyalgia are unknown, though it affects around seven times as many women as men.It can lead to pain, stiffness and numbness all over the body, induce headaches and migraines, and hamper sleep."
98,"Rolling Stone, the iconic 50-year-old magazine of music and counterculture, is putting itself up for sale amid an increasingly uncertain outlook, its founder said.Jann Wenner - who started Rolling Stone in 1967 as a hippie student in Berkeley, California and now runs it with his son Gus - told The New York Times that the future looked tough for a family-run publisher.""There's a level of ambition that we can't achieve alone,"" Gus Wenner told the newspaper in an interview published late Sunday.""So we are being proactive and want to get ahead of the curve,"" he said.One of the most influential magazines covering rock music, Rolling Stone has also been a home for experimental writers such as the gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.But the magazine's reputation - and finances - were badly damaged when it retracted a 2014 story about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia, with a review finding that Rolling Stone did not undertake basic journalistic procedures to verify the facts.Rolling Stone last year sold a 49 per cent stake to a Singaporean music and technology start-up, BandLab Technologies, which is headed by Kuok Meng Ru, the scion of one of Asia's richest families.It was not immediately known if Kuok would want to take a controling stake in Rolling Stone.The Wenner family earlier this year sold its other two titles - celebrity magazine US Weekly and lifestyle monthly Men's Journal - to American Media, Inc., a publisher of supermarket tabloids including The National Enquirer.If American Media, Inc., were interested in Rolling Stone, it would mark a sharp change in owners' ideologies.The tabloid empire is led by David Pecker, an ardent ally of President Donald Trump, while Rolling Stone tilts strongly to the left and has featured lengthy interviews with Democratic presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.Jann Wenner, 71, who is also a key force behind the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, said that he hoped to keep an editorial role at Rolling Stone but that the decision would be up to its new owner."
99,"FRANKFURT: German carmaker Audi is taking a lead in bringing more automated driving to roads, but rivals seem in no rush to follow while legal and regulatory uncertainties still cloud the technology.At the Frankfurt car show, Audi paraded the A8 which can drive itself under certain conditions, help the driver to change lanes and does not require drivers to monitor the road - though they must be ready to intervene at the sound of an alarm.On a scale where zero is a fully manual car and five a fully autonomous one, the A8 is a level three, putting it ahead of level two features offered by Tesla and General Motors (GM).Struggling to emerge from the shadow of parent Volkswagen’s diesel emissions scandal, Audi is badly in need of a new prestige model and a marketing coup.“It’s gratifying that we are able to set a positive sign for real ‘Vorsprung durch Technik’,” said research and development chief Peter Mertens, referring to Audi’s advertising slogan meaning “advancement through technology”.But with special approval still required almost everywhere to drive such a car, and question marks over how quickly the driver has to take back control - and who is responsible during handover - some rivals are skeptical the market is ready.“Who will accept to pay for something that they can use only in extremely limited conditions?” asked Didier Leroy, European chairman of Japanese carmaker Toyota.“The fact that Audi is introducing this one now doesn’t mean that we will rush in the coming months to say that we are able to do it too. That is not our logic,” he told Reuters at the car show.Among the A8’s new features is the “traffic jam pilot”, which can completely control driving at up to 60 kilometers (37 miles) per hour on a divided highway.The German company expects customers will be able to use all the model’s self-driving functions next year or in 2019. It is applying for approval country by country, starting with Germany, a spokesman said during the show.Audi thus hopes to leapfrog Tesla, whose Autopilot technology suffered a major blow when a driver using it was killed in a crash, and GM, whose Super Cruise feature to be offered this autumn will allow limited hands-off driving at highway speeds on limited access roads like dual carriageways.In the wake of the crash, Tesla said the driver was using Autopilot in conditions for which it was not intended, and US regulators said automakers should take steps to make sure semi-autonomous systems are not misused.Regulatory regimes vary widely across the world and, in the United States, even from state to state, creating a headache for manufacturers. Some authorities would rather they held back.“We’re very concerned about the idea that drivers will be encouraged to pay even less attention than they already are and that manufacturers are rolling out these systems without existing federal standards,” Linda Bailey, executive director of the US National Association of City Transportation Officials, told Reuters.Florida, seen as the least restrictive state, has essentially legalised all forms of autonomous driving without the need for a permit or insurance requirements. New York, at the other end of the spectrum, has a law that demands drivers always have at least one hand on the wheel.Michael Jellen, president of Velodyne, which develops lidar sensing technology that is used in autonomous cars, said the industry still had a long way to go.“When they truly launch a hands-free, driver disengagement system, that’s when we think (the industry) will have evolved,” he said in an interview. “Today, when someone has their hands on the wheel and their foot ready to brake, I call that driving.”In Europe, Germany is the pioneer, having passed a law in May that legalizes autonomous driving in principle as long as a licensed driver is behind the wheel - although approval still has to be sought for individual models.German politicians hope to persuade the European Union to adopt common regulations to speed adoption of autonomous driving and prevent self-driving systems from having to switch themselves off or change parameters when they encounter national borders - so-called geofencing.German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt hosted ministers from France and Luxembourg at the Frankfurt show on Thursday to establish a cross-border testing ground.In an attempt to address one area of uncertainty, Audi says it will assume liability for any accidents that happen when its automated driving technology is in use.But it will come at a price.While Audi has not yet fixed premiums for level three technology, the base price for the A8 without optional extra technology is already $108,000.Though level three, unlike level two, means theoretically the driver need no longer monitor the road while the car is in charge, the need to potentially jump in to take control limits the activities the driver can do when not in charge.A risk is that drivers relax their guard too much.“It sets an expectation to the driver that the computer is in control - that’s what level three means. It means I can sit back and read a book,” said Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey.Autopilot features have long been used in aeroplanes, but the situation is very different there, where a pilot typically has plenty of time to react.“It’s very, very rare to face another plane coming just in front of you and just to react in two seconds to avoid a crash. In the car, it’s possible,” Toyota’s Leroy said.Even then, the hand-off from computer to pilot can be bungled, resulting in crashes such as an Asiana flight into San Francisco in 2013 that killed three people and injured scores.Some question the worth of introducing level three at all at this stage.German automotive supplier Continental, with 1.2 billion euros in assisted driving component sales last year, said industry experts were questioning whether the grey zone in which neither the driver nor the car was clearly in control could be overcome.“There is a discussion going on at the moment as to whether one shouldn’t skip level three after implementing level two,” Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart told Reuters at the show.Bosch, the world’s biggest automotive supplier, said it was seeing great demand for level three technology.Yet at its presentation at the show, it did not talk about autonomous driving in general, but rather only particular applications to solve particular problems, such as an automated valet parking garage it has built with Mercedes maker Daimler in Stuttgart, which should go into service next year.“Everything we do in driver assistance has a mass-market use,” Bosch mobility chief Rolf Bulander said. “We’re not interested in inventing things that will become reality only in a decade.”France’s PSA Group, which is developing autonomous driving technology with partners for its future Peugeot, Citroen, Opel and DS vehicles, said there was still value in technology that needed human oversight and regular intervention - with the right framework of rules.“It still allows you to send and receive emails or read, even while staying on the alert,” programs and strategy chief Patrice Lucas told Reuters. “The biggest hurdles are regulatory.”"
100,"LAHORE: Minister for Railways and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Khawaja Saad Rafique Monday said that Maryam Nawaz needs to be ""cautious when addressing public meetings"".Speaking exclusively to Geo News, the PML-N leader said the former first daughter is like a younger sister to him.

101,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s premier first-class tournament, Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, is being played at different venues with several top players from the country in action for different teams.However, it seems, security at these matches is not among the priority which has left players angry with the board and local administration.Geo.tv has received videos from Jinnah Stadium Sialkot where Pakistan cricketers Umar Gul and Ahmad Shahzad were seen getting angry at fans.Upon investigation, one player informed that cricketers were harassed by the fans at the venue and there was no security.“Some fans were pushing us, some were pulling our shirts, one player was literally punched in the back by someone,” said a player on condition of anonymity.“Fans didn’t let us move towards our bus, we were literally squeezed,” the player added.Another video footage received by Geo.tv showed how players had to struggle to move towards their vehicle at the end of the match.The sources, meanwhile, told Geo.tv that PCB has also taken a note of the incident at Jinnah Stadium Sialkot and demanded a report from the regional association.“The security was the responsibility of local regional association and the PCB had inquired from them on the matter,” said a source.“The RCA of Sialkot informed the PCB that despite repeated requests, the local administration of the city didn’t provide security at the stadium,” the source added."

104,"WASHINGTON: US Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price promised on Thursday to repay the nearly $52,000 cost of his seats on private charter flights, as expensive air travel by Trump administration officials drew sharp scrutiny from Congress.“Today, I will write a personal check to the US Treasury for the expenses of my travel on private charter planes,” said Price, a former member of Congress, in a statement. “The taxpayers won’t pay a dime for my seat on those planes.”Price was one of a handful of senior officials in President Donald Trump’s administration put on the defensive over reports about their use of charter flights and government aircraft, sometimes for personal travel, when they could have flown commercial for less money.commercial for less money.Price told Fox News on Thursday that Trump had spoken to him about the matter and was not happy. Asked if he retained Trump’s confidence, Price said he worked at the president’s pleasure.Washington media outlet Politico reported that Price had taken at least two dozen private charter flights since May at a cost to US taxpayers of more than $400,000.Politico in a report on Thursday night said the White House had approved the use of military aircraft for other trips by Price to Africa, Europe and Asia in the spring and summer that cost taxpayers more than $500,000.“Secretary Price will write a personal check to the US Treasury for $51,887.31,” a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday.Price is paying his individual share of the charter flight cost, an HHS official said. Price said earlier on Thursday he believed he retained Trump’s confidence.Senior US government officials travel frequently, but are generally expected to keep the costs down by taking commercial flights or the train when possible.Price, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin were all in the spotlight for their travel habits.Politico reported late on Thursday that Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke took a charter flight from Las Vegas to Glacier Park International Airport in Montana in June that cost $12,375. The route is served by commercial flights.Zinke also took charter flights between St. Croix and St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands in March and used a military aircraft to travel to Norway in May, according to Politico.“As with previous interior secretaries, the Secretary travelled on charter flights when there were no commercial options available,” Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement. “All travel is pre-approved by the ethics office before booking and the charter flights went through an additional level of due diligence.”Republican Senator Chuck Grassley urged Trump in a statement ”to emphasise to cabinet secretaries the necessity of using reasonable and cost-effective modes of travel in accordance with federal restrictions.”In his statement, Price said his travel had been approved by legal and departmental officials. But he expressed regret over the concerns raised and pledged to take no more private charter flights while health secretary.“I was not sensitive enough to my concern for the taxpayer,” said Price, an orthopaedic surgeon. He was confirmed in February as health secretary despite questions about how he had been buying shares in publicly traded healthcare companies while working on legislation affecting them.As a conservative Republican US representative in 2009, Price chastised “the fiscal irresponsibility” of private-plane use by government officials in an appearance on CNBC television that he also posted on Twitter.Price’s travels and those of the entire Trump Cabinet are being probed by a US House of Representatives committee. Senate Democrats wrote to Price on Thursday demanding information about his flights.The inspectors general at HHS, EPA and Treasury are investigating to see if government travel rules were followed.The EPA’s inspector general said last month it was investigating Pruitt’s frequent travels to his home state of Oklahoma. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Pruitt had taken at least four non-commercial and military flights since mid-February, costing taxpayers more than $58,000.EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said Pruitt did use one charter flight but that other commissioned flights were done on government planes.“The administrator flies commercial, unless there is a necessity to do otherwise, and with approvals from EPA’s ethics office,” said EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox.At the Treasury Department, the inspector general is reviewing Mnuchin’s use of a government plane to fly to Kentucky in August for a visit to Louisville and Fort Knox. Mnuchin and his wife viewed the solar eclipse during the trip.On the “CBS This Morning” programme on Thursday, Mnuchin said he would use military planes in the future only when there are national security issues or “there’s no other means” of travel."
105,"An Australian blogger who faked brain cancer and professed to have cured the disease with natural therapies was fined Aus$410,000 (US$320,000) on Thursday over the false claims.The Federal Court in Melbourne found that Belle Gibson deceived people when she launched a popular cookbook and smartphone app in 2013 asserting she overcame cancer through alternative treatments, including Ayurvedic medicine and a gluten-free diet.In 2015 she confessed to an Australian magazine that she lied about the diagnosis. It also emerged that she failed to make donations she had publicly pledged to charity.""If there is one theme or pattern which emerges through her conduct, it is her relentless obsession with herself and what best serves her interests,"" Justice Debra Mortimer said in handing down the fine for misleading and deceptive conduct.Gibson, 25, who did not attend the hearing, made some Aus$420,000 from her book and a popular social media business, promising much of the earnings to charity.Mortimer said people bought her app as they incorrectly believed profits were going to a good cause.In one of ""the most serious"" instances Gibson promised a week's earnings to a family whose child had a brain tumour.""She did this to encourage members of the public to buy her product (The Whole Pantry app), to generate income for herself and her company, and generally to promote herself and her commercial activities,"" the judge said.""She consciously chose to use the terminal illness of a little boy in this way."""

107,"North Korea's Asian Cup football qualifier with Malaysia was postponed for a third time on Thursday after Malaysia imposed a ban on travel to the country, citing rising nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula.Next week's game in Pyongyang had already twice been delayed following a row over the assassination of Kim Jong-Nam, half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-Un, at a Kuala Lumpur airport.On Thursday, Malaysia's foreign ministry banned travel to North Korea with immediate effect, citing the ""escalation of tensions in the Korean peninsula"" arising from Pyongyang's missile tests.""All Malaysians are banned from travelling to North Korea until further notice... The travel ban will be reviewed once the situation has returned to normal,"" the foreign ministry said Thursday.The Asian Football Confederation said Thursday's game was now postponed, adding it ""will now refer the matter to the appropriate committees to decide on the future status of this match"".The game was originally scheduled for March 28, but was deferred because of the row over the murder of Kim Jong-Nam in Malaysia in February.Kim's assassination sparked a diplomatic crisis which saw both countries banning each other's citizens from leaving, and withdrawing their ambassadors. Tensions have since eased.The fixture was rescheduled to June 8 in Pyongyang but then moved again to the next best available date in the international football calendar, which fell on October 5.The latest postponement comes after Malaysia's football chief Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim met a North Korean envoy in Malaysia last week and discussed the safety of players and officials, in what appeared to be positive talks.Tunku Ismail, who had earlier warned about the dangers of Malaysian players being poisoned in North Korea, was told he could travel directly through North Korean airspace any time he wanted to visit the country.""It is the highest honour as any other world leader will need to stop by in Beijing beforehand,"" a statement said."
108,"BARCELONA: Thousands of striking high school and university students rallied in Barcelona Thursday to defend Catalonia's right to hold an independence referendum which Madrid has vowed to stop.""We will vote!"" and ""Independence!"" they chanted as they marched along the Gran Via — one of Barcelona's main avenues — blocking traffic. Many were draped in red and yellow Catalan independence flags.Barcelona police said 16,000 people took part. Organizers put the figure five times higher at 80,000.The Catalan government has insisted it will press ahead with Sunday's plebiscite in the wealthy northeastern region which is home to 7.5 million people, despite a crackdown by Madrid which wants to prevent a vote ruled unconstitutional by the courts.The showdown is one of Spain's biggest political crises since the end of the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco four decades ago and it had deeply divided Catalonia.Opinion polls show Catalans are split on the issue of independence, but a large majority want to vote in a legitimate referendum to settle the matter.""The majority of young people are separatists, and if they weren't, they have become separatist after seeing what Spain has done in recent weeks,"" 16-year-old high school student Aina Gonzalez told AFP.Over the past few days, judges and prosecutors have ordered the seizure of electoral material including millions of ballot papers, the closure of websites linked to the vote, and the detention of key members of the team organising the referendum.The electoral board set up to oversee the vote has been dissolved, and on Wednesday a judge ordered police to prevent public buildings from being used as polling stations.The crackdown continued Thursday as police seized more than six million ballots and envelopes and 100 ballot boxes at a warehouse in Igualada, a town near Barcelona, a police source said.It is the first time ballot boxes have been confiscated though it is unclear if they were destined for the referendum, as the company alleges they were for internal elections at the FC Barcelona football club.Some students have said they may occupy schools and universities that could be used as polling stations, which firefighters and farmers have vowed to protect.Mossos d'Esquadra — Catalonia's regional police force — has warned of the risk of ""the disruption of public order"" if officers try to prevent people from casting ballots. But Spain's central government downplayed the risk of violence.""If the judge's orders are carried out… there is no reason for there to be a violent response on the part of anybody, and I trust this will be the case,"" Jose Antonio Nieto — secretary of state for security — told reporters.Justice Minister Rafael Catala accused Catalan president Carles Puigdemont of ""serious irresponsibility"" for pressing ahead with the vote and repeated Madrid's call that the separatists ""stop this process"".Madrid argues that the referendum is illegal as it goes against the Constitution.Catalonia's leaders retort they have a right to decide their future even if it not allowed by the Constitution.""This referendum does not solve anything, it is a problem because it pits the two sides of Catalonia against each other,"" said Alex Ramos — the vice president of a group that opposes secession called the Sociedad Civil Catalana (SCC).He said the ""silent majority"" of Catalans who oppose the referendum would not protest in the streets to avoid raising tensions.Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau called for European Union mediation in the standoff over the vote in an opinion piece in Britain's Guardian daily newspaper, writing the city ""does not want a collision with unforeseen consequences"".Meanwhile, media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders complained that journalists were the target of pressure from both the pro and anti-independence camps.The Bank of Spain warned that political tensions over the independence drive in Catalonia — which accounts for about a fifth of the Spanish economy — put its growth forecasts at risk although it kept them unchanged for this year and the next.Lorena Torrecillas — a 27-year-old physiotherapist who passed by the student protest — said she opposed independence because the pro-separatist camp had not explained well enough what the advantages of splitting from Spain would be.""I prefer to remain with what is known than with what will come because it could be very good or very bad,"" she told AFP."
109,"Twitter said on Thursday it had suspended about 200 Russian-linked accounts as it probes online efforts to meddle with the 2016 US election, but an influential Democratic senator slammed its steps as insufficient.Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, summoned Twitter officials to testify behind closed doors on Thursday as part of a broad investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election. Facebook faced a similar grilling earlier this month.Lawmakers in both parties suspect social networks may have played a big role in Moscow’s attempts to spread propaganda, sow political discord in the United States and help elect President Donald Trump. Moscow denies any such activity, and Trump has denied any collusion.Twitter also briefed the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee on Thursday.Warner said Twitter officials had not answered many questions about Russian use of the platform and that it was still subject to foreign manipulation.The company’s presentation to the Intelligence Committee “showed an enormous lack of understanding from the Twitter team of how serious this issue is,” Warner said. He took particular umbrage at what he said was Twitter’s decision to largely confine its review to accounts linked to fake profiles already spotted by Facebook.Twitter said it had identified and removed 22 accounts directly linked to about 500 fake Facebook pages or profiles tied to Russia and that it unearthed an additional 179 accounts that were otherwise related.Twitter declined to comment when asked about Warner’s comments.In addition to the private testimony by its officials, the company published a public blog post on Thursday with its most detailed discussion to date of the steps it was taking to combat propaganda.Warner in remarks to reporters called Twitter’s statements “deeply disappointing” and “inadequate on almost every level.”The comments signalled that the congressional investigations into Russia’s use of social media platforms would not ease up. Twitter, Facebook and other Internet companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google are facing a steady stream of criticism as more information emerges about manipulation of their platforms during the 2016 election campaign.Users, lawmakers and technology analysts have long criticized Twitter as too lax in policing fake or abusive accounts. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows both anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making it far more difficult to police the service.On Thursday, researchers at Oxford University published a study concluding that Twitter bots disseminated misinformation and propaganda at a higher rate in US battleground states than in noncompetitive states during a 10-day period around Election Day in November.San Francisco-based Twitter said Russian media outlet Russia Today, which is close to the Kremlin, had spent $274,100 on Twitter advertisements and promoted 1,823 tweets potentially aimed at the US market.Those ad buys alone topped the $100,000 that Facebook this month linked to a Russian propaganda operation during the 2016 election cycle, a revelation that prompted calls from some Democrats for new disclosure rules for online political ads.Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, was more tempered in his assessment of Twitter’s briefing, saying in a statement that the firm expressed a desire to work cooperatively with investigators and conduct additional analyses.Twitter announced new measures to toughen restrictions on suspect spammers, for example by reducing the time that suspicious accounts stay visible during company investigations.To thwart abuse via applications interacting with Twitter, the company said it had suspended 117,000 apps since June that had been responsible for 1.5 billion “low-quality” tweets this year.Twitter said it wanted to strengthen disclosure rules on political advertising, as Facebook has just done.Warner is leading efforts to introduce legislation requiring internet platforms to reveal who is purchasing online political ads, which would bring them in line with rules governing ads on radio or television.He told reporters on Thursday he did not have a Republican co-sponsor for a draft measure he was circulating he was confident there would be bipartisan interest."

112,"UNITED NATIONS: The United States pressed Thursday for the International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out more nuclear inspections in Iran, warning that failure to do so would make the nuclear deal with Tehran ""an empty promise"".Nikki Haley — the US Ambassador to the United Nations — said that some countries were trying to shield Iran from more inspections by the IAEA, which is charged with verifying Tehran's compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord.""Without inspections, the Iran deal is an empty promise,"" she said in a statement.Haley's push for more inspections comes just 15 days before Trump must certify to the US Congress whether Iran is in compliance with the agreement.""If the Iran nuclear deal is to have any meaning, the parties must have a common understanding of its terms,"" Haley said in a statement.""Iranian officials have already said they will refuse to allow inspections at military sites, even though the IAEA says there must be no distinction between military and non-military sites.""Now it appears that some countries are attempting to shield Iran from even more inspections.""Although she named no countries, diplomatic sources said she was referring to Russia.Ten days ago, the head of the Iranian nuclear program, Ali Akbar Salehi, accused Washington of sabotaging the agreement and called on IAEA to resist Washington's ""unacceptable demands.""He took particular aim at Haley, who he said had made unjustifiable demands regarding the verification of the nuclear accord. Those demands included IAEA inspections of Iranian military sites.The United States has recently multiplied its attacks on the accord, which Trump had vowed to scrap last year during the US presidential campaign.At a debate Wednesday organized by the Asia Society, Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif warned that a US withdrawal from the accord would be a ""strategic mistake.""""The US needs to show it is a reliable partner,"" he said.He also defended Iran's role in Syria and Iraq as justified by the need to defend populations threatened by terrorist organizations.Iran's missile development programs also were needed, he said, to protect the Iranian people at a time when other countries in the region, like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are making massive arms purchases.The Iranian nuclear accord — signed in July 2015 by Iran and six world powers, including Germany, China, the United States, France, Britain, and Russia — puts Iran's nuclear installations under strict surveillance.The accord's aim is to guarantee that Iran's nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only, in exchange for a gradual easing of international sanctions."

115,"OTTAWA: Netflix will spend Can$500 million (US$400 million) over the next five years to make original films and television shows in Canada, the company and Heritage Minister Melanie Joly announced Thursday.This amounts to about five percent of the video streaming service's estimated total US$7 billion production budget for 2018.As part of a deal with Ottawa, Netflix will open its first production company outside of the United States in this country, while avoiding minimum Canadian content regulations and paying into a government arts fund.It agreed also to highlight Canadian-made content in both English and French on its global platform.""It is important for us to see and hear stories that reflect back to us who we are as we are learning about our place in the world,"" Joly said in a speech.""I hope this (deal) will be a model followed by other countries in the world,"" she later told reporters.Ottawa had been under pressure by Canadian broadcasters to impose a tax on Netflix, akin to fees paid by broadcasters, that could be used to fund Canadian programming.Canadian broadcasters also must fulfil a quota of Canadian content on air, which streaming services are not required to match.Facebook, Netflix, Spotify, YouTube, and other online firms reach Canadians directly, outside of Canada's regulated broadcast system.Most of their content is produced outside of Canada.The government's deal with Netflix under the Investment Act allows it to claim a victory for Canadian content while also avoiding imposing new regulations on Internet companies.According to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), there were about 11 million households in this country hooked up to cable or satellite television in 2016.But their numbers are dwindling, with an estimated 200,000 or two percent of television subscribers per year cutting the cord, said an April report titled ""The Battle for the North American Couch Potato.""The trend started in 2012 — two years after Netflix began offering streaming services in Canada — and is expected to accelerate over the coming years, said the Convergence Research Group, which authored the study.Netflix, which government sources say has about five million subscribers in Canada, had lobbied against being treated like a traditional broadcaster.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rejected a so-called ""Netflix tax"" in the 2015 election that swept his Liberals to power.Joly cited already high rates paid by Canadians for broadband Internet access in her decision not to add a new tax on streaming services.""Our government won't increase the cost of these services to Canadians by imposing a new tax,"" Joly said.Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said investments like this one would give Canadian producers and creators more access to financing, business partners and ways to connect with audiences around the world.""Fans around the world are already falling in love with Netflix originals produced in Canada,"" he said. ""Today's announcement affirms there's more to come as Netflix launches Netflix Canada, our permanent production presence in Canada.""The company has already co-produced a handful of Canadian television series with public broadcaster CBC and others, including Anne, based on the novel Anne of Green Gables, and Canadian author Margaret Atwood's Alias Grace.As part of a swath of new cultural policies, Joly also announced new ""cultural trade missions"" abroad to help Canadian creators break into new markets.Ottawa will seek to expand international co-production treaties to grow production budgets and attract financing partners, she said.As well, parliament will be asked to review Canada's Copyright Act, as well as update the Broadcasting Act and Telecommunications Act for the digital age."

118,"KARACHI: Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday said that he is not disappointed with the verdict in the Inspector General of Police Sindh AD Khawaja's case.In a verdict passed on September 7, the Sindh High Court (SHC) dismissed the provincial government's order to remove Khawaja as Sindh Police’s top boss.IG AD Khawaja had been removed by the provincial govt earlier this year The two-judge SHC bench also restored the IGP’s powers of transfers and postings within the police department, declaring all postings and transfers carried out in the province after July 7 as illegal.""We have a few reservations [with the IGP's case] but consultations are underway,"" Shah said while talking to the media in Tando Allahyar. The court, on April 3, had dismissed the provincial government’s decision to remove the Sindh police chief after a group of activists approached the SHC challenging his controversial removal.The legal wrangling between civil rights activists and the provincial government, which lasted for over ten months, ended with the court's orders, but the ruling party remains disgruntled with the verdict.Appearing on Geo News' program Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath after the verdict was announced, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Saeed Ghani said, ""If courts will decide the transfers and postings of IGPs, then the provincial government shouldn't be held accountable for any situation that may arise, for which the Sindh government is constitutionally responsible.""The senator added that despite no apparent issue with Khawaja's performance as the police chief, the 'uncomfortable relationship' between the IGP and Sindh government higher ups has made it seemingly impossible to maintain a smooth working relationship.Ghani lamented that while on one side, the province's former IGP Ghulam Hyder Jamali was removed at the Supreme Court's behest, the SHC has imposed the decision for Khawaja to continue as the IGP on the Sindh government.The federal government sacked the Sindh police chief last year on March 12 — a day after he conceded before the Supreme Court that illegal appointments had been made in the police department.The apex court gave the provincial government a choice to remove the police chief either during the inquiry or after it.Following the court's orders, the federal government on the recommendation of Chief Minister Qaim Ali Shah transferred Jamali and appointed Khawaja — then AIG Special Branch — as his replacement."
119,"LONDON: Ben Stokes has long been thought of as key to England´s chances of success during the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, and that view has only hardened since his place was put in jeopardy by his arrest.Speculation over Stokes´s future intensified Thursday when England suspended him from international matches until further notice after the publication of a video apparently showing him fighting outside a Bristol nightclub.The Test vice-captain was included in England´s Ashes squad announced this week, despite his arrest on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm in the early hours of Monday, after an incident which left him with an injured hand.The unseemly turn of events has left England in a quandary over Stokes, whose ability with both bat and ball makes him that most highly prized of cricketers -- a genuine all-rounder.That was true in more ways than one when this year saw Stokes became the Indian Premier League´s most expensive foreign player when he was signed by the Rising Pune Supergiant for £1.7 million ($2.2 million).He made good on the price-tag by scoring 316 runs at a strike rate of 142.98 and taking 12 wickets at an economy rate of 7.18 in the Twenty20 event.Stokes´s on-field failures can be as great as his successes -- the prime example being when Carlos Brathwaite hit him for four successive sixes to snatch a stunning win for West Indies in the last over of the 2016 World Twenty20 final.But Stokes, unlike many other players, has forged a successful career in all three international formats and often demonstrates more guile than is suggested by his all-action approach.Nevertheless, his capacity to score quickly, which excites crowds and frustrates opponents in equal measure, is the most eye-catching of a range of talents that also include excellent close-catching.The 2015 Lord´s Test against his native New Zealand -- the 26-year-old was born in Christchurch but moved to England with his family as a boy -- saw his innings of 92 and 101 help England regain the initiative, with Stokes taking three wickets as well.His left-handed batting also yielded a remarkable Test innings of 258 from just 198 balls against South Africa in Cape Town in 2016.Stokes can make an impact with the ball too, as he showed while taking six for 36 in the second innings of England´s Ashes-clinching victory against Australia at Trent Bridge two years ago.He has also thrived in a hostile cricket environment, making his maiden Test century against Australia in Perth during the 2013/14 Ashes series where England suffered a humiliating 5-0 defeat.Stokes´s fiery temperament was laid bare when he punched a locker and broke a bone in his right hand after a dismissal in 2014, forcing him to miss that year´s World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.His judgement in nightclubbing this week, during an ODI series against West Indies, may also be questionable but former Australia captain Ian Chappell was in no doubt of his value to the England side.""Stokes is two things -- he´s a class above the rest, and he´s such a match-winner that he drags the team along with him,"" Chappell told the Wide World of Sports.""If he gets things right and plays really well, he´s the sort of player who can lift the rest of the team.""Without him they (England) are no chance (to win the Ashes),"" he added.That helps explain why Stokes was made vice-captain to Test skipper Joe Root, with England coach Trevor Bayliss -- himself an Australian -- saying he was ""a leader within this group when it comes to cricket"".""If England must do without him, they will be badly damaged before a ball has been bowled (in Australia),"" former England captain Michael Atherton wrote in The Times.In one sense England need Stokes more than he needs them, as he is among the first generation who can play Twenty20 tournaments rather than Tests to enjoy a lucrative career.But no one should doubt his pride in playing for England, or the hurt he´ll feel if he does indeed miss the Ashes."

122,"SARAJEVO: The remains of about 20 victims from Bosnia´s 1990s civil war, most likely Bosnian Muslims, have been exhumed from two newly-discovered mass graves, the Missing Persons Institute said Wednesday.One of the graves was discovered in the mountainous area of Koricanske Stijene in central Bosnia, where more than 200 civilian men were executed by Serb forces in August 1992 following their eviction from a northwestern region.It marked one of the most brutal episodes in the inter-ethnic conflict, which lasted from 1992 to 1995 and left around 100,000 people dead.At the end of the war, 31,500 people were reported missing. Since then, the remains of 25,000 victims have been exhumed from hundreds of mass graves, according to the Bosnian Institute, leaving 6,500 unaccounted for.""Since the beginning of the exhumation at Koricanske Stijene on September 7, about 30 clusters of human bones have been exhumed, essentially incomplete skeletons,"" said Lejla Cengic, a spokeswoman for the institute.She said identities would be determined by DNA testing, adding that the 30 clusters did not necessarily correspond to the remains of the same number of people.Five previous exhumations in the same area, between 2003 and 2013, recovered the remains of 117 victims and the search is still ongoing for 98 others, Cengic said.The second mass grave was uncovered in the eastern region of Vlasenica.""Exhumation work began on Tuesday and so far we have discovered the complete skeletons of 10 people. We believe they´re Bosnian Muslim victims killed in 1992,"" she said.According to the country´s victims´ associations, 2,600 Bosnian Muslims from Vlasenica were killed during the conflict."
123,"LONDON: Prime Minister Theresa May watched as the first ever game of cricket was played in Downing Street, led by a British Pakistani female cricket coach.Saba Nasim, who is a practising lawyer and a certified English Cricket Board (ECB) coach, led the historic cricket game session in which Stuart Broad and Heather Knight also took part. The event was organised by charity organisation Chance To Shine which encourages youngsters to take part in sports and make a positive contribution.Saba Nasim said it was a thrilling experience to play cricket outside 10 Downing Street because “it's for the first time in the history of 10 Downing Street that cricket was played outside the famous number 10 door and watched on by the British Prime Minister”.“The aim was to show people of different backgrounds playing cricket and to show that British Asians also have talent and that cricket is accessible for all no matter what your background. Some of my Pakistani girls were also playing and handed the PM a shirt as a gift,"" she added.Saba Nasim was awarded the British Empire Medal by the Queen earlier this year for services to cricket in London and also Coach of the Year Award by Chance to Shine last November for running a girls project and for introducing cricket to many Asians in local communities in east London at the grassroots level.She shared: “I was asked to lead the session and took along some girls from my successful Chance to Shine Street project at Redbridge. It was a fantastic opportunity to play cricket in the most famous street in the UK and to showcase the work that the charity is doing in bringing cricket to those most disadvantaged in our communities.""The Prime Minister, a keen cricket fan, said: “It’s been a privilege to meet the young players and inspirational coaches today. The work Chance to Shine does, introducing young people from disadvantaged communities to this great, fast-paced version of cricket, is invaluable. After the success of the England team in the Women’s World Cup this year, I hope boys and girls all over the country will continue to be inspired to get involved with this brilliant sport.”Chief executive of Chance to Shine, Luke Swanson said: “Over the course of this magnificent summer for English cricket, many boys and girls have picked up a bat and ball for the very first time. We want to show that the beautiful game is for all young people, and can be played anywhere. What better way to do that than with a game of street cricket in the most famous street of all.”"
124,"LONDON: Doctors have told Dr Asim Hussain that he will be advised about his “fitness for surgery” after detailed examination of his blood tests and scans including medical reports of the past year.The former federal minister and close aide of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) leader Asif Ali Zardari arrived in London two days ago, after the Supreme Court of Pakistan allowed him to travel abroad on medical grounds.Asim was placed on the Exit Control List in November 2015. He subsequently petitioned the courts to be allowed to travel abroad for medical treatmentDr Asim, who is staying at his son’s central London flat, visited Wellington Hospital on Wednesday where he was examined in detail by leading neurological surgeon Dr James Alibone.“I visited Wellington Hospital for my disc surgery and to inform the doctors about the acute complications I have faced which have impacted my health generally, especially while I was in detention,” Dr Asim told this correspondent in a conversation. “Dr James Alibone will be assessing my reports and will be giving his opinion in few weeks.”Dr Asim confirmed that he has consulted Prof DiMario, a cardiologist at Royal Brompton Hospital, and was advised seven days Holter monitoring of the heart for his cardiac arrhythmia after which he will be assessed for fitness for surgery.“I will return to Pakistan as soon as doctors allow me to do so,” Dr Asim said, adding that he taking his health issues very seriously and that’s the main purpose of his journey to London.Former petroleum minister, out on bail in two cases of corruption and one of terrorists' support, was recently allowed by the Supreme Court to travel abroad for treatmentDr Asim reached London on the weekend after his legal counsel succeeded in getting his name struck off from the Exit Control List (ECL).The former federal minister is out on bail in two cases of corruption and one of facilitating terrorists. He has maintained that the cases against him are baseless and “politically motivated.” Dr Asim insists that there is no evidence against him and so far the prosecution has failed to come up with anything substantial to prove the allegations.  The Supreme Court ordered the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency on August 29 to remove Dr Asim's name from the ECL, overturning an earlier Sindh High Court ruling.Dr Asim was allowed to leave for abroad for one month for medical treatment after submitting a surety of Rs6 million.Asim was placed on the ECL in November 2015. He subsequently petitioned the courts to have his name removed."
125,"JERUSALEM: Israel supports the establishment of a Kurdish state, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday, as Kurds in Iraq gear up for a referendum on independence that lawmakers in Baghdad oppose.Israel has maintained discreet military, intelligence and business ties with the Kurds since the 1960s, viewing the minority ethnic group — whose indigenous population is split between Iraq, Turkey, Syria and Iran — as a buffer against shared Arab adversaries.On Tuesday, Iraq’s Kurdish leader Massoud Barzani said he would press ahead with the September 25 referendum despite a vote by Iraq’s parliament rejecting it.“(Israel) supports the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve their own state,” Netanyahu said, in remarks sent to foreign correspondents by his office.Western powers are concerned a plebiscite in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region - including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk - could divert attention from the war against Daesh militants.Netanyahu said Israel does, however, consider the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) a terrorist group, taking the same position as Turkey, the United States and the European Union.An Israeli general told a conference in Washington last week that he personally did not regard the PKK, whose militants have been fighting Turkey for more than three decades, as a terrorist group.Netanyahu, who is due to address the UN General Assembly on September 19, voiced support for “the Kurds’ aspirations for independence” in a speech in 2014, saying they deserve “political independence”.His latest remarks appeared to be a more direct endorsement of the creation of a Kurdish state.But they will cut little ice in Baghdad, which has no diplomatic relations with Israel and has strong ties with Israel’s arch-foe Iran.Iraq’s neighbours — Turkey, Iran and Syria — oppose the referendum, fearing it could fan separatism among their own ethnic Kurdish populations.Kurds have sought an independent state since at least the end of World War One when colonial powers divided up the Middle East after the collapse of the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire."

It is irresponsible of the authorities to continue the use of the shotguns despite being aware of the damage they do.""Government forces in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK) have been using pellet guns since 2010 as a ""non-lethal"" weapon following widescale civilian protests against Indian rule.After a spate of gruesome injuries last year that earned the title ""epidemic of dead eyes"", Amnesty and other rights groups called for a complete ban on the use of the shotguns.A single cartridge fired releases at least 500 high-speed metal pellets. These lodge in any available body part and are difficult to remove.""In some cases, those injured by pellet-firing shotguns still have the metal pellets lodged in their skulls, near their eyes,"" said Dr Zahoor Wani, the lead campaigner in the group.In its report, Amnesty said it interviewed people aged from nine to 65.Among them was nine-year-old Asif Ahmad Shiekh, whose eyes were damaged by the pellets.""Watching cartoons on TV, playing with my friends on the street, reading books for hours — this is what I dream of now,"" the report quoted him as saying.Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947.

128,"KABUL: A suicide bomber blew himself up near a cricket stadium in the Afghan capital Kabul on Wednesday, killing three people including a policeman and wounding five others, police said.The attacker detonated the bomb after he was stopped at a security checkpoint by suspicious police as he walked towards the Alokozay Kabul International Cricket Ground where a match was under way.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, the latest in a series of deadly assaults in the city.""The security forces by sacrificing themselves have prevented the attacker from reaching the crowd (inside the stadium) and creating a catastrophe,"" police spokesman Basir Mujahid told AFP.Two of the wounded were police officers.Several ambulances were seen speeding away from the scene, apparently taking the injured to hospital, an AFP reporter said.Scores of police blocked the road leading to the stadium where the sixth match of the Shpageeza Cricket League season between the Boost Defenders and Mis Ainak Knights was under way.The competition started Monday.Hundreds of spectators could be heard from outside the stadium as firefighters washed down the area where the bomber had blown himself to bits.Afghanistan Cricket Board spokesman Farid Hotak told AFP the match was briefly interrupted and ""all players and cricket board officials are safe"".The last major attack in Kabul happened on August 29 when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a bank days before the Eid festival, killing five people and injuring several others.Wednesday´s assault came hours after eight Afghans expelled from Germany arrived in Kabul after Berlin resumed deportations of Afghan asylum-seekers.It had suspended the process when a huge truck bomb tore through the city´s highly fortified diplomatic quarter on May 31, killing around 150 people and wounding hundreds more.The latest group represented the sixth wave of repatriations of Afghans from Germany since December under a disputed Afghan-European Union deal aimed at curbing the influx of migrants.Berlin has argued that it can safely repatriate people to Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan, even as Taliban and Islamic State militants terrorise much of the country.""They told me that there is no problem in your country and you can live there so you can´t stay here (Germany) anymore,"" Mohammad Jamshidi, one of the deportees, told AFP."
129,"LAHORE: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Najam Sethi on Friday said the board made a mistake while deciding ticket prices for the ongoing three-match Independence Cup series between Pakistan and World XI.The PCB chairman admitted that a reason for spectators not turning up to watch the match was the high price of tickets for the series.The first match between the two teams on Tuesday could not get a full house at Lahore’s Qaddafi Stadium.PCB had priced the tickets at Rs500, 2,500, 4,000, 6,000 and 8,000 for different enclosures, and for many it was just too expensive.“I have a family of five, if I am going to the Imran Khan enclosure (Rs6,000), I will have to pay 30,000 rupees, and few more for food and other expenses. That would be Rs35,000 for three hours entertainment,” a fan had pointed out yesterday.When a journalist raised the issue during Sethi’s press conference with ICC’s CEO David Richardson, the PCB chief admitted the mistake and promised that the board will learn from this and will make a better price list next time.“You are absolutely right about prices,” Sethi responded to the journalist. “We made a mistake by setting such high prices.”He said the PCB, while setting prices for the tickets, was misled by the trend it witnessed during the PSL final in Lahore earlier in March.“We were misled by the trend we saw in PSL when prices were unimportant and irrelevant and people paid high prices to come and witness the event,” the PCB chairman added.Sethi said it was a learning experience and following the comparatively low turn-out, the board will review its pricing policy for future events.“We should have kept lower prices for the three-match series. But I can assure you that we’ll learn from this and considerably and significantly reduce prices for future.”The PCB chairman also highlighted that some people did not turn up due to strict security arrangements at various points in the city.“The security was so tight that many people from different areas couldn’t reach or went back home,” he said.“We can do very little about it as, despite our requests, the Punjab government is relentless in providing security,” Sethi added."

131,"LAHORE: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has termed the Independence Cup series between Pakistan and World XI as a stepping stone in the right direction but added that the complete resumption of cricket in Pakistan is a long process and will happen gradually.Talking to media in Lahore, along with PCB chairman Najam Sethi, Dave Richardson, the former South Africa cricketer, said that security arrangements for the series are satisfying and things in Pakistan have improved during the last two years significantly.“A test series is by its nature much longer than three T20s,” he said when asked about prospects of a full series in Pakistan.“I think the next step is to grow capabilities, improve capabilities in areas and cities outside of Lahore, to build the confidence of teams like Australia and England, and all other teams that it’s safe to tour Pakistan on a more regular basis and for much lengthier periods of time,” he said.Richardson, while talking further on the complete return of cricket to Pakistan, added that this might take some time.The ICC CEO added that through this tour, Pakistan can convince other teams to tour the country but ruled out any ICC event before 2023, saying that hosting rights of all events have already been awarded to different countries.“ICC events till 2023 have already been decided and awarded. I think Pakistan, in the last two years has made tremendous strides in improving the security situation. It is a long process and an early stepping stone. Let’s get through this tour and have other teams touring Pakistan,” he said.Richardson further confirmed that ICC is facilitating the PCB by investing and improving security related capabilities in the country.“ICC has already agreed to invest in security and developing and improving the security capabilities for a three year period. Whether the second and third year include a World XI tour has not been decided, maybe not,” he said.“I think the intention would be to bring more and more PSL matches to Pakistan, but also to bring member countries to tour Pakistan, not just a world XI tour and it would be ideal to have international cricket return to Pakistan under normal circumstances,” Richardson added.He also spoke about ties between PCB and BCCI and brushed aside the impression that ICC has been favoring India against Pakistan.Over the matter of not having an Indian player in the touring World XI side, Richardson said that the political situation between the two countries would have added unnecessary pressure on any Indian player in the side.He said that from a political point of view, because of the relationship, the focus would have been on the Indian player and one can imagine the pressure from the security point of view. “PCB and Flower have taken a practical line on it.”"

133,"STOCKHOLM: How many people have won a Nobel Prize? Who was the oldest winner? How much do they win? Here are some facts and figures about the Nobel Prizes:-- 5 prizes were created by Alfred Nobel in his 1895 will for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace, which were awarded from 1901. A sixth prize in economics, ""in memory of Alfred Nobel"", was created by Sweden´s central bank in 1968.-- 6 laureates have declined the prize. The only two to do so of their own will were France´s Jean-Paul Sartre, who turned down the 1964 literature prize, and Vietnam´s peace negotiator Le Duc Tho, who refused to share the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize with US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Adolf Hitler forbade three German laureates -- Richard Kuhn (chemistry 1938), Adolf Butenandt (chemistry 1939) and Gerhard Domagk (medicine 1939) -- from accepting the prize, while Soviet authorities forced Boris Pasternak to decline the 1958 literature prize.-- 17 was the age of the youngest laureate to be honoured, Malala Yousafzai of Pakistan (Peace 2014). The oldest laureate was Russian-born American Leonid Hurwicz (Economics 2007), who was 90.-- 18 laureates have been affiliated with the two universities claiming the most Nobels: Stanford and the University of California, Berkeley.-- 21 years: That´s how long Myanmar´s Aung San Suu Kyi had to wait before she could travel to Oslo to collect the peace prize she was awarded in 1991. Also deprived of their liberty: German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky (Peace 1935), who died in 1938 without being allowed to leave his country; and Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo (Peace 2010), who died earlier this year after being granted medical parole from prison.-- 28 English-language writers have won the literature prize, ahead of French (14), German (13) and Spanish (11) laureates.-- 48 women have won a Nobel prize, including Marie Curie who won it twice (Physics 1903 and Chemistry 1911). The economics prize, with only one female laureate in 2009, and the physics prize, with only two laureates, remain the most inaccessible prizes for women.-- 49 is the number of times the various juries have decided to not award the prize. The peace prize has had no recipient 19 times, most recently in 1972.-- 50 years must pass before the juries´ top secret deliberations are made public.-- 67 is the average age of the economics prize laureates - the oldest average age across all disciplines. The youngest average age can be found among physics laureates at 55.-- 318 is the tally of nominations for the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize. 104 people have received the prize since its creation, and 26 groups or organisations. In 1942, 1943 and 1944, no nominations were accepted.-- 579 is the number of times a Nobel has been awarded, to 911 individuals, between 1901 and 2016. A third of laureates were born in the United States. The laureates born in Sweden (29), Norway (12) and Denmark (11) have together won more than those born in Japan (24), China (11) and India (7) together.-- 500 metres of linen tablecloth are placed on the 60 tables at the Nobel gala banquet celebrating the laureates, held each year at Stockholm´s city hall on December 10 in honour of the death of Alfred Nobel.-- 1,350 people are typically invited to the banquet, where 260 waiters serve food on 7,000 pieces of china, along with 5,400 glasses and 10,000 pieces of silver cutlery.-- 9 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million or 940,500 euros) is the sum to be awarded for each Nobel Prize in 2017, to be shared if several laureates are honoured in the same discipline.

Australia are playing for pride after losing the first three games.Warner, who smashed 124, put together a 231-run opening stand with Aaron Finch, who made 94, to pulverize the Indian bowling attack at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.The left-handed Warner hit 12 fours and 4 sixes during his 119-ball innings. It was his 14th ODI century since making his debut at Hobart in 2009. The batsman got to his milestone with a boundary off part-time spinner Kedar Jadhav, jumping for joy as the runs were marked up. He later fell to Jadhav´s off-spin and walked off to a standing ovation.Finch, who missed out on his second successive century, soon followed his partner back to the pavilion after getting caught at mid-on off paceman Umesh Yadav. He hit 10 fours and 3 sixes in his 96-ball knock.The 30-year-old Warner is the eight batsman in world cricket to register a ton in his 100th ODI with West Indies´ Gordon Greenidge being the first against Pakistan in 1988."
136,"ISLAMABAD: Opposition Leader Khursheed Shah Thursday said the reports regarding appointment of a new chairman of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) did not have substance, adding that no name had yet been proposed for the key slot.Shah, in his statement issued to media, said he was in touch with all political parties and would expedite consultation after Ashura Muharram. ""I have held consultation with Tehreek-e-Insaf, besides meeting the prime minister. But neither the premier, nor the opposition has yet proposed a name for NAB chief,"" he said, adding that only Jamaat-e-Islami has proposed a name for the post.The leader of the opposition said that he would suggest a unanimous name to the prime minister after consultation with all opposition parties. ""People's party decides on national affairs through consultation, while in the past too we took opposition parties into confidence on such matters.""He further said if the government and opposition failed to reach a consensus on appointment of the NAB chairman, then the matter would be forwarded to concerned parliamentary committee.Shah said the 12-member committee, which had six members each from the government and opposition, would appoint the NAB chief through voting.Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) member Naeemul Haq said he had heard that the Intelligence Bureau (IB) director general was being made the NAB chief. ""If this happened, we would oppose it,"" he added."
137,"COX'S BAZAR: At least 10 children and four women were killed when a boat carrying Rohingya fleeing violence in Myanmar capsized off Bangladesh on Thursday (Sep 28), as the number of new arrivals topped 500,000.The latest disaster came as a UN visit to Myanmar's conflict-battered Rakhine state was postponed Thursday, thwarting efforts to reach the epicentre of violence for the first time since the start of the massive Rohingya exodus.At the scene of the accident, witnesses and survivors said the boat overturned just yards from the coast after apparently hitting a submerged object and was later washed ashore in two parts along with the victims' bodies.""They drowned before our eyes,"" said Mohammad Sohel, a local shopkeeper. ""Minutes later, the waves washed the bodies to the beach.""One distraught survivor said he had set off for Bangladesh from a coastal village in Myanmar late Wednesday with his wife, who was killed in the disaster along with one of his children.""The boat hit something underground as it came close to the beach. Then it overturned,"" Nurus Salam told AFP.Another survivor who was seen weeping on the beach told an AFP reporter at the scene that her parents and children were missing.Local police constable Fazlul Karim told AFP 14 bodies had so far been washed ashore, and there were fears the number could rise.The UN said more than half a million refugees had now crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar since Aug 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts prompted a military crackdown.It said the flow of new arrivals had slowed and the new figure of 501,800 - up from around 480,000 - was due mainly to the counting of refugees not previously included in the tally.The huge influx of Rohingya to Bangladesh - the largest mass movement of refugees in the region in decades - has created a humanitarian crisis as the government and aid agencies struggle to provide food, clean water and shelter.Those who have made it to Bangladesh have brought with them multiple accounts of murder and systematic arson of their villages by Myanmar soldiers and mobs of ethnic Rakhine, who are Buddhists.Rakhine has long been a cauldron of ethnic and religious tensions, but the last five years has seen communal relations plunge to their worst yet, and there are reports thousands more Rohingya could be waiting to enter Bangladesh.Images circulated by Myanmar authorities on Wednesday showed hundreds waiting to cross the Naf River that divides the two countries.Access to Rakhine by relief agencies and global media has been heavily controlled by Myanmar's army and government, making it difficult to assess the situation there.On Thursday, the UN said a planned visit to the state was postponed due to weather conditions there.The United Nations has been demanding access since its humanitarian organizations were forced to pull out of Rakhine when Myanmar's military launched operations against Rohingya rebels in late August.Police in Bangladesh say an estimated 120 Rohingya have drowned trying to reach the country's shores in small fishing boats that coastguards say are woefully inadequate for the rough seas, many of them children unable to swim.Survivors said the boat that capsized on Thursday was carrying around 40 people, many of them children.Local police chief Abul Khair said at least 18 people survived the accident and they were trying to find out how many were missing.""We have sent nine of the survivors to hospitals,"" he told AFP."

140,"KABUL: Haji Rabbani was preparing for afternoon prayers when he saw the US helicopters hovering above his mud-brick house in a residential area of Kabul. Moments later bombs started raining down.Six members of his family, including four children, were wounded in Wednesday's airstrike that was supposed to hit insurgents fighting Afghan security forces several kilometres from where US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was meeting with officials.Two bombs struck Rabbani's home - several hundred metres from where the insurgents were holed up - destroying an upstairs room, shattering windows and sending debris toppling into the courtyard.NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan expressed regret for the ""harm to non-combatants"" caused by the US airstrike - the first carried out inside the city in recent memory - and blamed a defective missile. An investigation is underway.The strike was launched in support of Afghan security forces who had confronted militants armed with mortars and suicide vests after they fired a volley of rockets near the capital's international airport - hours after Mattis arrived in the country for a high-profile visit.One person was killed and 11 wounded - including the six people at Rabbani´s house - in the fighting that lasted several hours as Mattis and NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg met with Afghan leaders to discuss the broader conflict.Both the Taliban and the Daesh’s local Khorasan province affiliate claimed responsibility for the rocket attack.After the airstrike, Rabbani ran inside his home to get his family out. A child in the upstairs room that took the full force of the explosion was on the floor, mud bricks covering most of her small body.""I just got out of the bathroom and came out to perform the ablution when the strike took place,"" Rabbani told AFP on Thursday as he sat on a carpet in his debris-covered courtyard, smoking and drinking green tea with relatives.""I rushed towards the house and shouted for my children.""Two children and two adults remain in hospital.Shrapnel from the bombs had peppered the rooms and blood spatters could be seen on door frames, walls and in the courtyard.Rabbani said he did not understand why foreign forces had targeted his family when he had no links to the insurgents firing rockets near the airport.""I do not belong to the government nor am I affiliated with anyone. I am a poor person who works in the city,"" said the 49-year-old taxi driver.Large fragments of the bombs lay on the ground nearby, one piece showing a partial label that read ""50.9 KG"".""There are no Daesh or Taliban in this area and the fighting is almost three kilometres from here - and they bombed my house.""It is not the first time a US bombing attack has hit the wrong target.An American airstrike in 2015 destroyed a Doctors Without Borders trauma centre in northern Kunduz province, killing over 40.In July a US airstrike killed 16 policemen in Helmand province. It came after a US strike in Helmand´s Sangin district killed at least 18 civilians, mostly women and children, in February.Rabbani and his family have joined a growing list of civilians who have become casualties of Afghanistan´s grinding 16-year war.The number of civilians killed and wounded was at a record high in the first six months of 2017, a UN report shows, made worse by the Afghan Air Force carrying out its own airstrikes along with US Forces.""Airstrikes carried out by international and Afghan air forces caused 590 civilian casualties (in 2016), nearly double that recorded in 2015,"" a separate UN report shows, with women and children accounting for more than half of the victims.While NATO has acknowledged its mistake, Rabbani´s family wants compensation not sympathy -- and for the strikes on ordinary Afghans to stop.""They do not target the enemies in front of their eyes -- they target our house and kill our people,"" said Rabbani. "
141,"CHICAGO: Two toddlers were hospitalized in critical condition after a playmate accidentally shot them with a loaded gun at a daycare in the US state of Michigan.Police in the Detroit suburb of Dearborn said the child managed to get a hold of a loaded gun on Wednesday inside a private home that functioned as a daycare. The toddler fired either one or two shots that struck two children -- both three years old, according to US media which also reported that there were multiple guns inside the home.""I´m not going to guess on what occurred in there, but obviously there were weapons in proximity to where kids are, and that´s totally unacceptable to me,"" Dearborn Police Chief Ronald Haddad told reporters. As many as 1.7 million American children live in homes with an unlocked, loaded gun, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun violence, and the incident was the latest case of children being injured by unsecured firearms.Nearly 1,300 children die and 5,790 are treated for gunshot wounds each year in the United States, according to a recent study published in the medical journal Pediatrics. Michigan state law does not prohibit guns at child care facilities, television station WXYZ reported, but requires them to be unloaded and stored in a locked location away from children. The home daycare was run by Samantha Eubanks, herself a mother of six who regularly took care of other children according to neighbors and family members.Eubanks did not permit her husband Tim to keep weapons in their home, according to a woman identified by US media as her sister.""She would always say don´t you ever bring a gun in this house, it´s not going to happen,"" Ashley Escobedo told assembled reporters at the scene. The police chief told US media that the investigation was ongoing and charges were possible. "

We were no worse affected than other airports. It only lasted a few minutes,” the spokesman said.

Finding and training the painters to reproduce Van Gogh’s work.More than 4,000 artists from around the world applied for the job and 125 were chosen and put through three weeks training.“Even though we were hiring the very best oil painters, Vincent’s style look like it should be very easy but actually it’s difficult to do well,” said Welchman.“Even after training there were still quite a few painters who really found it impossible to get to grips with his style,” Welchman said.The $5.5 million production focuses on the last weeks of Van Gogh’s life before his death in 1890 in France at age 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Welchman said the film has triggered some unusual responses.“We’ve had a lot of people in tears at screenings. People are sending poems or making cakes with intricate Vincent paintings on the cake,” he said.He and Kobiela hope the film encourages audiences to discover more about Van Gogh.“I’d like them to think there is more to his story than he went mad, cut off his ears, was a genius and did these incredibly colourful paintings that sell for lots of money.”"

The teenagers was shifted to a private hospital for medical treatment. Earlier in the day, a 28-year-old woman was attacked in the afternoon. She had said that a man on a motorcycle, wearing a helmet, had attacked her with a sharp-edged instrument from behind.Women are being targeted in the mysterious attacks, which have been reported near Rabia City and Jauhar Chowrangi are of Gulistan-e-Jauhar in the last three days.One of the victims, who was attacked on September 26, told Geo News that an unidentified man on a motorcycle wearing a black helmet attacked her from behind.As a result, her leg was severely injured and she took a rickshaw to reach her house. The victim's mother then took her to a hospital and her father informed the police.However, when the police reached her house, they arrested her father for the incident. Her father, Abdul Rashid, remarked that he was detained overnight and claimed the police had asked him for a bribe.Another survivor, a student of seventh grade, informed police that she was attacked from behind near Rabia City in Gulistan-e-Jauhar. The girl said she was unable to identify the attacker as he had covered his face with a helmet.""I went outside to buy something when I was attacked by the assailants on a motorcycle,"" she said, adding that at least one of the attackers was wearing a black shirt.The victim’s mother said her daughter had received eight stitches for her wounds.According to the spokesperson of a private hospital in the area, as many as five girls have been brought to the hospital for treatment of knife injuries in the past few days.Speaking to Geo News, SP Gulshan said that as many as four women have been attacked by unidentified persons near Rabia City and Jauhar Chowrangi. He added four women were injured in two respective attacks on September 25, and one girl was attacked the very next day.Police have started investigations into the case, he said. Panic has gripped different localities in Gulistan-e-Jauhar following the attacks.Speaking in this regard, a female student of Karachi University said that police officers have advised women to be careful while walking on the streets. “We have been directed to not leave our houses after Maghrib prayers,” remarked another student.Female students also said that they are taking all possible precautions including avoiding walking alone at night and not staying out for too long.While referring to the attacker, one KU student said that the attacker seems to be suffering from a psychological disorder. “Normal people do not commit such acts,” she added. Another student said that government should take notice of the issue and resolve it immediately. "
149,"KIEV: The destruction of two ammunition depots this year have dealt the biggest blow to Ukraine’s combat capability since the start of its separatist conflict, security and military officials said on Thursday.Massive explosions at a military depot in the Vynnytsya region, 270 km west of Kiev, forced the authorities to evacuate 24,000 people on Wednesday. Another large depot was destroyed in March.It is not clear if the explosions were accidents or sabotage, either of which would underscore poor security at the bases, but officials traded blame for the resulting losses.“The country has suffered the biggest blow to our fighting capacity since the start of the war,” the secretary of the Ukrainian Security and Defence Council, Oleksandr Turchynov, told journalists.Earlier the defence ministry said the Vynnytsya depot contained 83,000 tonnes of ammunition.“There are many violations of fire and air safety at our arsenals. And these are the consequences,” Turchynov said. “We’ve shown that we’re not capable of protecting our strategic arsenals.”Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the Vynnytsya blaze, which the authorities have said may have been started deliberately, citing “external factors”.Chief military prosecutor Anatoly Matios said the site’s alarm system was out of order and its security team lacked sufficient guards and up-to-date equipment.“The main issue which must be addressed is the personnel problem of guards whose salaries are very low, and in general security is carried out by elderly people, who certainly don’t have hawk-eye vision,” Matios told journalists.There have been four large fires at ammunition and weapons depots since late 2015 - an additional drain on Ukraine’s military, which has been fighting separatists in eastern regions for more than three years.“It will be hard for the government to restore the military reserves that have destroyed by explosions over the past two years. This is hundreds of billions of hryvnias,” Matios said.Both Matios and Turchynov said Ukraine’s General Staff, which is responsible for the military’s day-to-day operations, should be held accountable for security failings at the depots.In a post on Facebook, Chief of the General Staff Viktor Muzhenko denied accusations his institution was incompetent.The comments were intended to “sow doubt about the armed forces’ ability to protect its people, (and) undermine trust in the army,” he said."

We also believe that the listing will strengthen Rovio’s brand recognition and brand awareness ... and thus enhances Rovio’s competitiveness,” Chairman Mika Ihamuotila said in a statement.Rovio grew rapidly after the original “Angry Birds” game was launched in 2009, but was slow to respond to a shift to freely available mobile games that make revenue from in-game purchases.The company booked an operating loss and cut a third of its staff in 2015. However, sales are now recovering on the back of the 2016 release of 3D movie “Angry Birds”, as well as new games.In the first half of this year, Rovio’s sales almost doubled from a year earlier to 153 million euros, while core profit increased to 42 million euros from 11 million a year earlier."
151,"LOS ANGELES: Nearly 31 million viewers watched live US television coverage of Donald Trump's presidential inauguration, far fewer than tuned into Barack Obama's first swearing-in, but otherwise the biggest such audience since Ronald Reagan entered office, ratings firm Nielsen reported on Saturday.The tally for Trump - 30.6 million viewers on 12 broadcast and cable networks that aired live coverage from about 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. EST - surpassed the TV audiences measured for his two most recent Republican predecessors - both inaugurations of George W. Bush and the one of his father, George H.W. Bush.The 2009 inauguration of Obama, who became the nation's first African-American president that year, was watched by nearly 38 million viewers, the second-highest number since Nielsen began compiling such figures with Richard Nixon's 1969 oath of office. Only Reagan drew a bigger US TV inauguration audience, with nearly 42 million viewers tuning in to see the California Republican sworn in for his first term in 1981. Just 25 million watched Reagan take his second oath of office four years later.Trump's total was greater than both swearing-ins of Democrat Bill Clinton - 29.7 million and 21.6 million - and the second inauguration of Obama, who drew an average audience of over 20.5 million in 2013, Nielsen said.George W. Bush holds the distinction for having the least-watched inauguration in Nielsen's historical data - 15.5 million viewers in 2005 after he defeated John Kerry for his second term in the White House. That was down sharply from the 29 million who tuned in for Bush's first oath in 2001, following his contested election victory over Al Gore.The elder Bush by comparison averaged 23.3 million viewers.Nixon, a Republican, was the only two-term president since Nielsen began compiling such records to draw a bigger audience in his second inauguration than his first, rising from 27 million in 1969 to nearly 33 million in 1973.The only Democrat besides Obama to ever score more inauguration viewers than Trump was Jimmy Carter, with 34.1 million viewers watching his 1977 swearing-in, according to Nielsen.  "

The leaders spoke by phone on Saturday and discussed meeting on Jan. 31, he said.Trump has said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, signed in 1994 with Canada and Mexico, in order to improve terms for US workers.Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also spoke by phone on Saturday and discussed setting up ""additional meetings in the days to come,"" Spicer said.  "
154,"Lebanese security forces foiled an attempted suicide bombing at a cafe in Beirut's busy al-Hamra district late on Saturday, a security source said.The suspected bomber was stopped while wearing an explosive vest as he attempted to enter the cafe and before he was able to detonate it, the source said, adding that he was injured during his arrest and taken to the hospital.Militants have carried out a number of bombings in Lebanon in recent years including some motivated by the war in neighbouring Syria, but no major incidents have taken place for months.In June, eight suicide bombers targeted a Christian village in north Lebanon near the Syrian border, killing five other people. Twin blasts in November 2015 left 43 dead in the mostly Shi'ite Muslim southern districts of Beirut.Islamic State, a militant Sunni group that holds extensive territory in Syria, said it was behind those attacks. Some smaller attacks also took place last year that it did not claim.Attacks in Lebanon risk widening sectarian fissures that lay behind the country's 15-year-long civil war which ended in 1990 and that have been aggravated by the war in Syria.  "
155,"President Donald Trump can hire his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a senior White House adviser without breaking federal anti-nepotism laws, the US Department of Justice said.In a letter dated Jan. 20 posted on its website, the department's Office of Legal Counsel said the president has special hiring authority that exempts White House positions from laws barring the president from naming a relative to lead a federal agency. The New York Times first reported the decision, saying it was posted to the department's site on Saturday.Questions about Kushner's role emerged as voters and lawmakers questioned potential conflicts of interest for Trump, given his wide-ranging business interests, history of employing family members, and the influence of his daughter Ivanka Trump, who is married to Kushner.The office of White House counsel had asked the Justice Department for a definitive opinion on Kushner's role.The Justice Department said that if Trump chooses to officially hire Kushner and give him security clearance usually granted for White House staff, then conflict-of-interest laws would apply and Kushner would have to abide by their restrictions.""Congress has not blocked, and most likely could not block, the president from seeking advice from family members in their personal capacities,"" the department wrote in its 14-page opinion.""Consequently, even if the anti-nepotism statute prevented the president from employing relatives in the White House as advisors, he would remain free to consult those relatives as private citizens,"" it said.  "

157,"LANGLEY: US President Donald Trump told CIA officers on Saturday that he has great respect for the agency, denying that he had a feud with the intelligence community. In his first official visit to a government agency as president, Trump - who had said US intelligence tactics were reminiscent of Nazi Germany - sought to leave no doubt with officers that he supported their work.""Very, very few people could do the job you people do and I want you to know I am so behind you,"" Trump said, to cheers and loud applause.Ahead of the speech, some analysts said it would take more than a quick visit for Trump, who engaged in an unprecedented feud with the Central Intelligence agency and other US intelligence agencies before his inauguration, to patch up relations with a community he denigrated.Trump harshly criticised intelligence officials after they concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed hackers to breach Democratic emails to try to boost Trump's presidential election campaign.Then, after leaks about an unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a private security firm suggesting Moscow had compromising information about him, Trump blamed intelligence agencies for using Nazi-like tactics.Trump made no mention of Russia during his off-the-cuff remarks, which lasted about 15 minutes.He said the feud with intelligence agencies was made up by the media, and he called reporters ""among the most dishonest human beings on earth.""Trump also took issue with television shots and still photos of crowds that had gathered for his inauguration on Friday on the National Mall, suggesting that they were misleading and showed fewer people present than actually in attendance.Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell said Trump's visit to the CIA would be ""an important and positive gesture.""""The real test of the relationship between the president and his most important intelligence agency, though, will depend on how open he is to what CIA has to say about what is happening in the world,"" Morell said before Trump's speech.Outgoing CIA director John Brennan had stern words for Trump last Sunday, saying he needed to be more ""disciplined"" in his public comments.""I don´t think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia´s intentions and actions,"" Brennan said of Trump on Fox News Sunday.Trump, likening US intelligence to Nazis, suggested Brennan himself may have leaked an unsubstantiated report that the Russians had gathered damaging salacious personal information about him.The intelligence agencies had given both Trump and Obama a summary of the dossier, which later was published in full by BuzzFeed.Brennan said the US intelligence chiefs considered it their responsibility to make Trump aware that it was in circulation. "
158,"The death of a deputy superintendent of police in Karachi nearly three months ago left his widow with nothing but false promises, entangled in bureaucratic red tape. Despite the fact that her husband's funeral was attended by the Chief Minister, the Inspector General of the Police, and many other high-ranking officials, her desperate plea for help and compensation fell on deaf ears.Hers is not the only case. Families of many martyrs among the security forces face real hardship to get their legal rights.The Sindh Compensation of Shaheed Act, 2014 had promised speedy relief to the families of the martyred law enforcement officials, and particularly police officers, who had laid down their lives in the line of duty. Under the Act, the slain officer's family would be given land, two of his children would be employed, and the monthly salaries would continue, along with a compensation package announced by the police or government.It was an encouraging move on part of the previous government which acknowledged the sacrifice and bravery shown by police officers who had been at the forefront of the war against criminal elements, particularly for the last 15 years. Since then, some figures estimate that 15,000 people, including thousands of policemen, have been killed in Karachi alone in ethnic, sectarian and political violence.It has been two years since the Act was passed. Yet, there is a lack of will to implement it, and an utter disregard by the bureaucracy which often causes obstacles to ensure smooth payment of compensation.Often, the families of the departed soldiers would be found hoping against hope, standing outside the offices of home department, police department, or in the courts, seeking relief and pleading for salaries of their loved ones who laid down their lives to protect the people.Many of them avoid speaking to the media out of fear as it could jeopardize their efforts to get compensation entitled by the law. Photo from Nov 28, 2016 shows Shindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah consoling the sons of slain DSP Fazi Ali ShaigriThe wife of the DSP Faiz Ali Shigri, who was killed in November last year, wrote to the authorities to claim the compensation package. But come January, she neither got the reward that was promised nor the security for the family as entitled under the law or even otherwise in wake of threats.In the letter to Sindh’s top cop, AD Khwaja, dated January 7, 2017, she pleaded: ""You, along with the CM, were kind enough to assure us all possible help and assistance at the funeral prayers of my slain husband, who embraced Shahadat on Nov 27. I live with three children and due to observance of iddat, could not move around. I request you to provide me security as we are under threat.""In her second plea she requested a flat in the police building located in Saddar, as she felt insecure in her current residence in the Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of the city.During her iddat period, she was asked by the department to provide an original 'death certificate', post-mortem report, copy of CNIC of both the Shaheed and the widow, and family registration certificate from NADRA. The department could have fulfilled most of these requirements on their own without bothering a grieving widow.There are numerous stories of similar nature where Shaheed families suffered in clear violation of the Act. In another case, the son of a police constable lost his legal battle of getting a job after being told in December 2016 that he was over-age, whereas the fact that his application remained unattended for three years went unheeded, simply because he didn't have enough money to bribe the concerned officers who'd arrange to process his job application. Today, he is selling sweet potatoes near his town in interior Sindh.SP CID Chaudhry Aslam was assassinated on 9 January 2014 in a bomb blast targeting his convoy on the Lyari Expressway in KarachiEven in a high profile case as that of the top investigator and officer of the Central Intelligence Department, late Choudhry Aslam's family also suffered. One of his colleagues disclosed that even when he was alive and his house was attacked by a suicide bomber in late 2011, he was accommodated from a 'secret fund' only after he used political influence.The Sindh Compensation Act was invoked to ensure that the government and department would look after the families of martyrs and would give them jobs, salaries, rewards and plots, but, the suffering of the families after Shahadat of their loved ones paint a sorry picture.Perhaps with the exception of the military institution, civilian security departments almost always have had to rush from pillar to post just in order to get what they are promised by law.Whether it is operation 'Zarb-e-Azb', the Karachi operation, or the National Action Plan, this aspect cannot be ignored. Families of the martyred expect more than just words form the provincial government. —The writer is the senior columnist and analyst of Geo, The News and JangTwitter:@MazharAbbasGEO"

But I don't think Farhan (Akhtar) has any story for Don 3 right now.""The superstar added: “Apart from that, it is his ‘Ra.One’ which has the potential to be taken forward, although they don't have a story for it yet”.So, let’s wait when King Khan breaks the good news."

165,"Pakistan dropped four catches and let through several unnecessary runs in the fourth ODI against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.Here’s a list of the Green Shirts’ major fumbling moments in the field today, accompanied by the overs and commentary:23.4 Junaid Khan to Smith, 1 run, dropped. Full and angled wide outside off, he chops at it and it flies to Sharjeel at knee height at backward point, and he's put in a lazy one hand out at this and put it down. Dismal effort.32.2 Imad Wasim to Warner, no run, Dropped! Back of a length on middle, goes back and tries to cream it to the right of Hasan Ali at mid-on, but he gets it high on the bat and it floats to the fielder. Ali goes slowly, low to his right, and falls over as he tries to take it, it's been put down.37.4 Hasan Ali to Maxwell, 5 leg byes, 139 kph, oh dear. It was a lovely yorker, rapped him on the pads and rolled to the right of slip, who has a needless shy at the stump. The bowler is walking back lazily and makes no attempt at stopping this, and it's four overthrows through mid-on.38.4 Imad Wasim to Maxwell, 2 runs, dropped. Good length on middle, goes for the sweep, gets a top edge, Hasan Ali changes direction four or five times as he's running backwards from short fine leg and in the end can barely get a finger on it away from his body.43.6 Junaid Khan to Head, 2 runs, Dropped, Sharjeel is the culprit again. What are you doing Pakistan? Are you trying to out-Pakistan yourselves? Possibly a slower ball, full on middle and leg, Head miscues it in the air. Sharjeel lazily runs to his right from long-on. The ball pops in and pops out. The Pakistan fans in the stands can't believe it. Regulation catch.45.5 Junaid Khan to Head, 2 runs, Head is floored. Wide full ball outside off, reaches out and slices it away to short third man. Hasan Ali fires it miles over the head of Rizwan. Wild, wild throw. Horror fielding. Mickey Arthur can't watch this horror show. He covers up his face in his hands.48.3 Junaid Khan to Maxwell, 2 runs, attempts a yorker outside off, comes out as a full-toss, which is punched to mid-off where Azhar fumbles now.Credit: ESPNcricinfo "

168,"LAHORE The director of Rumi Forum and former principal of Pak-Turk School, Mesut Kacmaz, was ‘kidnapped’ along with his wife and two daughters by unidentified people from his residence in Wapda Town Sattukatla police limits in wee hours of Wednesday.Police are still clueless about the missing family. No FIR was registered till filing of the report. Sources in police said the family has been shifted to unknown location by the personnel of sensitive agencies over their suspicious activities.Police quoting eyewitnesses said at least 15 men in civvies entered Mesut Kacmaz’s house at around 1:30am and took away him, his wife and two daughters.A former teacher of Pak Turk School who lived in the same building was also taken away by the unidentified men when he resisted the kidnapping of the Turkish family, but he was released later. Turkish-language teacher, Fatih Avci, later approached the police to report the matter. Police have received the application but indecisive to register an FIR.The complainant told the police that the incident took place at around 1 am. He said out of the total ‘kidnappers’ five were females. They did not conduct any search-and-seize procedure, he told the police. He said as he saw the kidnapping attempt he protested over which they took him in custody as well. He said when the unidentified people took them to a building after the drive of 30-minute, they told him that he was not on their given list. They then blindfolded him again and drove him back to the gate of the housing society where he lived in.Sadr SP Rizwan Gondal on the issue said police are still clueless about the family. We have been trying to locate them by contacting other law enforcement agencies, he added. Once the situation gets clear legal action will be taken, the SP maintained.Sources said Mesut Kacmaz is currently on ‘UNHCR asylum-seeker certificates’ since November 2016 when Pakistan revoked visas of staffers working with the Pak-Turk Schools on the request of Turkish government. Turkey has blamed US-based preacher Fethullah Gülen for the failed coup in July 2016 and launched a crackdown on his supporters in country and globally. The ‘kidnapped’ director of Rumi Forum was also active against Tayyip Erdogan in Pakistan on social media.Since the attempted coup, Turkey has fired 21,000 teachers and arrested hundreds of academics. In a chain of 28 Pak-Turk Schools and Colleges in Pakistan, around 11,000 students are studying. The project was launched in 1995 by the Pak-Turk Foundation."

The security agencies were told that the money was being sent to a mosque, he revealed further.Ayyan Ali was stopped at Islamabad’s Benazir Bhutto International Airport on March 14, 2015 before reportedly boarding a flight to Dubai. She was arrested on charges of money laundering after customs officials recovered $506,000 from her luggage.In November 2015, Ayyan pleaded guilty when she was indicted for attempting to smuggle more than half a million dollars in cash out of the country. Ayyan’s name was also put on the Exit Control List which was finally lifted in February this year by the interior ministry, after which she was able to fly out of the country."

Pakistan has enhanced its diplomatic efforts and reiterated its strong commitment towards establishment of longstanding peace in Afghanistan. The efforts come as a backdrop of the announcement of US President Donald Trump’s strategy for the region in August, harshly criticising Pakistan for providing a safe haven to ""agents of chaos"".The US president cleared the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops to Afghanistan, backtracking from his promise to rapidly end America's longest war, while pillorying ally Pakistan.After the criticism, Pakistan proceeded to display its displeasure at Trump's remarks and postponed a visit by US acting Assistant Secretary of State Alice Wells.On August 24, in a meeting of the National Security Committee, the government strongly rejected certain allegations levelled against the country.A statement released also said that Pakistan has an interest in Afghanistan’s peace and stability and the country has dealt with the Afghan refugee problem after the withdrawal of Russia."
173,"WASHINGTON: The US Navy hospital ship Comfort is due to leave its home port in Norfolk, Virginia, on Friday for deployment to the hurricane-battered island of Puerto Rico, its first civilian disaster mission in seven years, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.The USNS Comfort, equipped to carry as many as 1,000 hospital beds, 12 operating rooms and one of the largest trauma units in the United States, is expected to arrive in Puerto Rico by the middle of next week, according to Defense Department officials. It takes up to four days to load and prepare the vessel.The vessel’s departure date was set a week after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico and three days after former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton urged Republican US President Donald Trump in a Twitter message to deploy the ship.Trump and Defense Secretary James Mattis “should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens,” Clinton, who served as secretary of state under Trump’s predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, tweeted on Sunday.Critics of Trump’s disaster response in Puerto Rico seized on the Clinton tweet, launching a petition on the website Change.org that drew some 260,000 supporters for the idea and igniting a #SendtheComfort social media campaign.The Pentagon did not explain why the vessel was not dispatched sooner or say whether Clinton’s admonition was a factor.But a Defense Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier this week that the Comfort was not deployed before then because the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA), which is overseeing disaster relief on the island, had not requested it.Asked why the Comfort had not been prepositioned in case of a deployment request, the official said weather conditions in the Caribbean and the incoming hurricane would have made it difficult.Maria, the most powerful hurricane to strike Puerto Rico in nearly a century, cut a swath of destruction across the island last Wednesday with roof-ripping winds, torrential rains and pounding surf.The storm claimed at least 16 lives on the island, knocked out the territory’s entire power grid, unleashed severe flooding and caused widespread heavy damage to homes and infrastructure. Governor Ricardo Rossello called it an unprecedented disaster for the island.Medical facilities were especially hard hit, many of them left wind-damaged, flooded and short-staffed. A majority of the island’s 69 hospitals were without electricity or fuel needed to run backup generators, according to a Defense Department assessment.The 890-foot (270-meter) Comfort, originally designed to treat US troops wounded in combat, has taken on a secondary mission during the past decade as a major asset for the Navy to deploy in response to natural disasters.Its last civilian relief assignment was in Haiti following a devastating earthquake there in January 2010. The Comfort also was dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and was sent on months-long goodwill humanitarian missions through Latin America and the Caribbean in 2007 and 2011.The ship, equipped with a large helipad, typically anchors offshore and takes aboard patients ferried to the vessel from land by helicopter or small boats.The Comfort will not be the only Navy ship sent to Puerto Rico. Two amphibious ships were previously deployed there - the USS Kearsarge and the USS Oak Hill."

My social media wall was inundated with public outpouring. I was humbled and overwhelmed. But when I started reading the verdict, the euphoria dissipated. There were high hopes from the court. It had promised a decision to be remembered for decades. Many thought the judges would hand a verdict that no saner mind could question on merit. That the Sharif family would be left with no excuse to portray itself as a victim, was yet another expectation. However, that much-awaited verdict was not only contrary to expectations, it lacked merit as well. It was thought to be based on reasoning instead of heresay. More so, the bench that handed the verdict comprised judges known for rising above personal biases. However, the reading of the verdict was a rude shock. The decision itself, according to Cyril Almeida, was found in search of reasoning. It though sent the prime minister home, the verdict provided him enough fodder to plead innocence in the court of public. The case started from the Panama Papers culminated at the Iqama of UAE. Nawaz Sharif was disqualified for not declaring the salary which he claimed having never received as Chairman of the Capital FZE. The learned judges thought it was receivable, no matter he didn’t get it. The benefit of doubt, according to criminal jurisprudence, goes to the accused. That benefit was denied which made it a unique case. Why the prime minister was sent home on a frivolous matter when a credible case could have been built through the Panama Papers revelation? The Sharif family was already running short of explanations. Why the court was in haste when the bench hearing the case was in control of everything right from its investigation to prosecution? Nobody can dare ask them. However, the process started becoming questionable after the Whatsapp calls were made to the heads of SECP and SBP for the choice officer. This could have been done through official channel as the court was justified in appointing the investigators it trusted. The induction of ISI and MI officers in financial investigation and the objectionable conduct of the JIT under control of the agencies raised further suspicions. More so, because the officers conducted DawnLeaks inquiry which dealt a severe blow to the government, were chosen for this task. The decision of giving administrative control of the JIT to ISI raised many eyebrows. Who leaked picture of Hussain Nawaz appearance before investigators was never explained despite promise. Did the khakis play any role in the ouster of the prime minister? We don’t have any evidence to establish the involvement of establishment like the judges didn’t have evidence to prove that Nawaz Sharif was receiving salary but nevertheless disqualified. However, the harassment of journalists voicing concerns about the fairness of trial and conduct of the JIT is indicative of the fact that there is more than what meets the eye. The emergence of sectarian and jihadi organizations in NA-120 election and inconvenience to the PML-N voters at the polling stations have left many questions unanswered. Holding the high and mighty is a welcome step but the way it is being done has muddled the entire accountability process. Right from the JIT's formation to disqualification of Nawaz Sharif on a petty matter and then hearing the review petition; referral of cases to NAB and the appointment of a referee judge; instruction for reopening the Hudaibiya Papers Mills case to hearing the appeal, all has been done by the three-member bench. How will this dispensation of justice be remembered in history? Only time will tell. However, if the ongoing debate is any guide, critics have started comparing it with Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s hanging. The decision of the case is credited to other forces instead of the court. This is certainly not a compliment for the judiciary. So when people congratulate me on my “role in ousting” the sitting prime minister, I refuse to accept such compliments, to the disappointment of my well-wishers. I return the greeting by voicing disappointment on the way it happened. As a journalist, I’m public surrogate. We are duty-bound to watch public interest, not that of rulers. Every story has its default beneficiaries and victims. The Panama Papers was a great story, nay, one of the best in my career. It made me dream of the day when the prime minister would face disqualification on merit and on the basis of solid charges. However, undue haste in removing him has shattered this dream. He has emerged as a victim instead of villain due to this questionable process."

179,"TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe officially dissolved parliament Thursday, effectively kicking off a national election campaign where he faces an unexpected and formidable challenge from the popular governor of Tokyo.Members of the lower house raised their arms and shouted ""Banzai"" three times -- the Japanese equivalent of ""three cheers"" -- after the speaker read out a letter from Abe officially dissolving the chamber.Voters in the world's third-biggest economy will go to the polls on October 22, as Abe seeks a fresh popular mandate for his hardline stance on North Korea and a new tax plan.""A difficult battle starts today,"" Abe told reporters, shaking his fist.""This is an election about how to protect the lives of people,"" said the premier. ""We have to cooperate with the international community as we face the threat from North Korea.""Abe asked for public support for his ""strong diplomacy"" on North Korea, which has threatened to ""sink"" Japan into the sea and fired missiles over its northern Hokkaido island twice in the space of a month.""We need to fight for our children's future.""Abe stunned Japan on Monday with a surprise call for a snap election, seeking to capitalise on a weak opposition and a boost in the polls, as voters welcome his hawkish North Korea policy.But Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has upended Japanese politics in recent days, stealing Abe's limelight with her newly launched ""Party of Hope"" that seeks to shake up the country's lethargic political landscape.Koike's new party, formally unveiled Wednesday, has attracted an influx of lawmakers from a wide range of ideological backgrounds and could unify opposition to Abe, presenting Japanese voters with a credible alternative to the premier.The head of the main opposition Democratic Party proposed to members that the DP should not run candidates in the October 22 poll and that they were free to join Koike's new group.For the moment, although Koike is leading the party, she is not running for a seat in parliament, preferring to concentrate on governing the world's most populous city in the run-up to the 2020 Olympic Games.But pundits say the charismatic former TV presenter, 65, could yet go all-in on her high-stakes gamble if she thought she could deflect criticism for ditching her current job after only a year.""The party may gain some seats in the Tokyo area, but a risk for her is that voters may feel betrayed as they voted for her as Tokyo governor and now she is working in national politics,"" Kensuke Takayasu, professor of political science at Seikei University, told AFP.But surveys show that Koike's gambit is starting to put pressure on Abe, 63, who until recently seemed to be a shoo-in for a fourth term at the helm.Abe enjoyed a healthy lead in the polls of more than 30 points only a week ago but the gap appeared to have narrowed following Koike's high-profile announcement.A survey in the Mainichi Shimbun suggested that 29 percent of voters would cast ballots for Abe's conservative LDP, while 18 percent would vote for the Party of Hope.Polls also suggest there are a large number of undecided voters, giving some hope to Koike's party that it can bridge the gap.Abe returned to power in December 2012 and has pushed a nationalist social agenda as well as his trademark ""Abenomics"" economic policy -- big-spending and easy money -- to end deflation and to kick-start the once world-beating economy.The scion of a political dynasty, Abe had promised to achieve two-percent inflation and stable growth in two years, but nearly five years later, he has failed to deliver on those pledges.He said on Monday he would use a planned hike in consumption tax from eight percent to 10 percent for new social spending, such as free early childhood education, while pushing back his pledges to restore the nation's fiscal discipline.Critics argue that Abe called the election to divert attention from an series of scandals in recent months that weighed on his popularity, including allegations of favouritism to a friend in a business deal -- which the premier strongly denies.The timing of the election, amid the North Korean crisis, has also faced questions, including from Koike, who said it created a ""vacuum"" at a time of national tension.Media-savvy Koike has vowed a break with old-school politics, promising to ""reset"" Japan and carry out reforms that are un-tied to vested interests.She hopes to put up as many as 100 candidates in the election."

This is a truly historic day,"" she told The Australian newspaper.""I'm being honest. I just cried.

I refused to give it up. My family kept it for me.

""I was pushed out of my job. After that, I had to move from my home.""Without a safe place to work or live, with other Saudis calling for my death, I had no choice but to leave the only country I had ever known.""She added: ""I had driven with the hope of freeing women in Saudi society -- and by freeing women, I also hoped to free men.""Saudi Arabia has some of the world's tightest restrictions on women.Under the country's guardianship system, a male family member -- normally the father, husband or brother -- must grant permission for a woman's study, travel and other activities.It was unclear whether women would require their guardian's permission to apply for driving licence."

185,"Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, who helped usher in the 1960s sexual revolution with his groundbreaking men's magazine and built a business empire around his libertine lifestyle, died on Wednesday at the age of 91, Playboy Enterprises said.Hefner, once called the ""prophet of pop hedonism"" by Time magazine, peacefully passed away at his home, Playboy Enterprises said in a statement.Hefner was sometimes characterized as an oversexed Peter Pan as he kept a harem of young blondes that numbered as many as seven at his legendary Playboy Mansion.This was chronicled in ""The Girls Next Door,"" a TV reality show that aired from 2005 through 2010. He said that thanks to the impotency-fighting drug Viagra he continued exercising his libido into his 80s.""I'm never going to grow up,"" Hefner said in a CNN interview when he was 82. ""Staying young is what it is all about for me. Holding on to the boy and long ago I decided that age really didn't matter and as long as the ladies...feel the same way, that's fine with me.""Hefner settled down somewhat in 2012 at age 86 when he took Crystal Harris, who was 60 years younger, as his third wife.He said his swinging lifestyle might have been a reaction to growing up in a repressed family where affection was rarely exhibited.His so-called stunted childhood led to a multi-million-dollar enterprise that centered on naked women but also espoused Hefner's ""Playboy philosophy"" based on romance, style, and the casting off of mainstream mores.That philosophy came to life at the legendary parties in his mansions – first in his native Chicago, then in Los Angeles' exclusive Holmby Hills neighborhood – where legions of male celebrities swarmed to mingle with beautiful young women.Long before the Internet made nudity ubiquitous, Hefner faced obscenity charges in 1963 for publishing and circulating photos of disrobed celebrities and aspiring stars but he was acquitted.Hefner created Playboy as the first stylish glossy men's magazine and in addition to nude fold-outs, it had intellectual appeal with top writers such as Kurt Vonnegut, Joyce Carol Oates, Vladimir Nabokov, James Baldwin and Alex Haley for men who liked to say they did not buy the magazine just for the pictures.In-depth interviews with historic figures such as Fidel Castro, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and John Lennon also were featured regularly.""I've never thought of Playboy quite frankly as a sex magazine,"" Hefner told CNN in 2002. ""I always thought of it as a lifestyle magazine in which sex was one important ingredient.""Hefner proved to be a genius at branding. The magazine's rabbit silhouette became one of the best known logos in the world and the ""bunny"" waitresses in his Playboy nightclubs were instantly recognizable in their low-cut bathing suit-style uniforms with bow ties, puffy cotton tails and pert rabbit ears.Hef, as he began calling himself in high school, also was a living logo for Playboy, presiding over his realm in silk pajamas and a smoking jacket while puffing on a pipe.""What I created came out of my own adolescent dreams of fantasies,"" he told CNN.""I was trying to redefine what it meant to be a young, urban unattached male.""After writing copy for Esquire magazine, Hefner married and worked in the circulation department of Children's Activities magazine when he began plotting what would become Playboy magazine.The first issue came out in December 1953 – featuring nude photos of actress Marilyn Monroe – and was a hit.As the magazine took off, it was attacked from the right because of the nudity and from the left by feminists who said it reduced women to sex objects.Hefner once declared sex to be ""the primary motivating factor in the course of human history"" and, using that as a business model Playboy flourished during the sexual revolution and into the 1970s with monthly circulation hitting 7 million.He ran into trouble in the 1980s with competition from Penthouse and Hustler – magazines that had much more explicit photos – and Playboy's social impact faded considerably by the 21st century.The Playboy Clubs closed in 1991 but would be partially revived.After suffering a minor stroke in 1985, Hefner made daughter Christie chief executive officer of Playboy Enterprises and she gave the business a makeover before stepping down in 2009.Hefner's son, Cooper, who was nearly 40 years younger than Christie, assumed a major role in the company in 2014.""My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom,"" Cooper said in a statement, according to posts on social media.Playboy magazine, starting with its March 2016 issue, did away with full frontal nudity in a rebranding that would have been unimaginable in the publication's heyday. Playboy resumed nudity a year later as Hefner's son Cooper announced a new philosophy for the company.In August 2016, one of Hefner's neighbors, a private equity investor, announced he had bought the Playboy mansion for $100 million with the understanding Hefner could stay there until he died.Before Playboy, Hefner married Millie Williams in 1949 and they divorced in 1959, starting a period in which he became the ultimate bachelor.The many women who shared his round, motorized, vibrating bed included models who posed in his magazine and in 1989 he married one of them, Playmate of the Year Kimberly Conrad.They had two sons but Hefner's experiment with traditional domesticity ended in divorce after 10 years.Conrad moved into a home next to Hefner so he could stay close to their sons.In 2008 after one of his girlfriends, Holly Madison, broke up with Hefner, he said he had hoped to spend the rest of his life with her. Shortly afterward he added 19-year-old twins to his group before turning to marriage again with Harris."
186,"Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani, architect of the 18th amendment, which resolved the longstanding question of provincial autonomy, has recently warned against the conspiracy to roll back this landmark decision. What he has missed is the question regarding failure of provinces in transferring power to local bodies, the only nursery available in the country to produce political workers. This has been the dilemma of our national political parties, whose approach is too narrow when it comes to making institutions strong.It is also important to assess performances of provinces in the ministries, transferred to them after the 18th amendment, such as Education, Health and Labour. It is a sorry state of affair when it comes to governance.The future of national politics has to come out from the concept of 'win Punjab, win Pakistan,' for which a serious debate is needed on more provinces particularly at a time when population census may be held early next year.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and PML-N in 2013 gave a very positive message to Pakistan by allowing nationalists to form the government in Balochistan, opposition PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in Sindh. He can take a bold initiative in strengthening democracy through more provinces and transferring powers to the local government's level.Such steps are needed for national harmony. China-Pakistan Economic corridor (CPEC) can become a game changer, if we are really sincere in changing the game.  Defending democracy against dictatorship is one thing and we all stood for the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution, but, within democracy it is the political parties which create hurdles in making people empowered and negate the very concept of democracy i.e. government of the people, for the people.Political parties lack a culture of democracy within themselves. As a result, they fail to empower people into taking decisions about their own future, weakening democratic institutions. Even the unanimously passed 1973 constitution could become a deterrent to the coup in 1977, 1999 and 2007.The parties did not even have the courage to challenge controversial amendments passed by the illegal parliaments of General Zia ul Haq's Majlis-e-Shora. The maximum it did was abolishing 58-2(B) and that too after four governments were dismissed.Today, the 1973 Constitution is not in its original form but in a distorted shape as weak and undemocratic national parties comprising cronies of military dictators could not correct the historic wrong.All this led to the failure of national politics as all political nurseries like student and trade unions had been destroyed and the parliament was left unable to restore the right of association and right to information. It is our national tragedy that we lost a major province before resolving the issue of provincial autonomy. Perhaps we have not learnt any lesson from past failures. We still defend feudalism. Some leaders implement ‘Jirgas’ to resolve issues in their area.It took almost 65 years to accept the demand of Pashtoons to rename North West Frontier Province (NWFP) to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, though it did not make the life of Pashtoons any better. It took us 60 years to settle the issue of provincial autonomy and no one knows how much time it will take to resolve issue of more provinces followed by empowering people.Pakistan since its inception in 1947, hardly has a party with a national character particularly after Pakistan Muslim League (PML) divided into fractions and as a result a democratic system could not be evolved. The break up of Pakistan also resulted because of the absence of national parties.If we just go through the very structure of the three mainstream parties, PML-N, PPP and PTI they can't be called true representatives of all the four provinces. This tendency in our political culture led to the rise of nationalist parties but with the passage of time they too became ethnic in nature and undemocratic, and as a result could not make inroads in the electorate. Most of these parties only play the role of pressure groups, like many religious parties.Most of the nationalist parties particularly in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, were the outcome of ban on the left-wing National Awami Party. Had NAP not been banned it would have had the potential to become a national party.Muhajir nationalism or its political dynamics also exist because of the absence of national politics and the failure of national parties in urban Sindh.The left-oriented National Awami Party despite its characteristics of a national party, and strong presence in then-NWFP and Balochistan, could not form government at the center due to its poor presence in East Pakistan and Punjab.  General Zia had shrunk national parties and promoted ethnic and sectarian politics on the one hand and through non-party based elections created further division in our national character. PPP was the worst affected, not only because of the hanging of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, but also because of a well hatched conspiracy to marginalise PPP. Benazir's assassination and post-BB politics of PPP confined the party to Sindh.PPP's political vacuum was filled by Imran Khan and PTI, but in the last three years, he could not consolidate his position in Sindh and Balochistan in particular and the next election would determine his strength in Punjab. His popular base still remained KP, and this leaves an interesting scenario.If PTI swept polls in Punjab, it would be an end to Sharif's politics as PML-N stands no chance in any other province; but if PML-N retained its position despite losing some seats it would still be able to form a government at the center.Either way the national crisis would persist and unless parties like PML-N, PTI and PPP expand their political structure to all the four provinces, national politics would continue to face difficulties in removing the sense of deprivation despite the 18th amendment and provincial autonomy.   Federating Units must be empowered by creating more provinces, which would also change the narrow nationalist approach of our nationalist parties. Can our parliamentarians and so called national parties take some bold steps to save democracy and resolve this unresolved national question? —The writer is the senior columnist and analyst of Geo, The News and Jang.

188,"Chief selector and former Test captain Inzamam-ul-Haq stopped by Geo Pakistan’s studios today where he answered some burning questions on Pakistan’s recent performance against New Zealand, first-class season and talent development, Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Hafeez’s selection dilemma and much more.Batting collapse in Christchurch TestOn Pakistan team’s batting woes against New Zealand’s pace attack, Inzamam said the team was unprepared to play on the fast, green pitch. He said there is a need to have more regular tours to places like Australia and New Zealand where our batsmen can get used to conditions different from the UAE’s slow, dry pitches.The chief selector offered his condolences on the demise of Misbah-ul-Haq’s father-in-law and confirmed Azhar Ali would lead the team into the second Test at Hamilton.Concerns over Amir, Asad ShafiqInzamam admitted Mohammad Amir’s bowling was not up to the mark recently. He expressed similar concerns over batsman Asad Shafiq.“These are all talented players but a good performance is overdue; hopefully they will regain their form in the next match,” he said, adding that the players need to feel confident in their abilities.‘Afridi’s return depends on performance, team’s requirement’Asked about Afridi’s chances of representing Pakistan again, the chief selector stressed that the all-rounder will only be considered if he performs in domestic cricket and if the team requires his services.“Performance alone is not enough. We will only consider including him if we need him,” Inzamam said.“The same applies to Umar Akmal and Ahmed Shehzad. They were kept out for disciplinary reasons and would need to earn their place back into the team.”‘Hafeez’s experience is valuable’Inzamam said the team is waiting to see results of Mohammad Hafeez’s bowling test. He added that the veteran player brings valuable experience with him into the team which would help the team's faltering batting.Focus on first-class cricketInzamam said that at the end of the domestic season in Pakistan, the selectors will round up the top 14 or 15 performers and call them to the team’s camp, where they will be coached and trained to prepare them for ultimate selection.The former captain criticised some players for choosing BPL over first-class cricket.“We don’t care how they perform in BPL, we want them to perform in domestic tournaments. That’s the selection criteria.”Inzamam added that the PCB is also focusing on discovering talent from rural areas of Sindh, Balochistan and FATA by holding trials in far-flung areas of the country.On a lighter note, when asked about his all-time favourite cricketers Inzamam said he was a big fan of Sir Vivian Richards.“Among bowlers obviously Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis,” he laughed. “The pacer duo were the hardest to face, which made it easier for us to face other quicks from around the world.”"
189,"LIMA: US President Barack Obama bid farewell to the world stage Sunday, pondering his legacy, offering advice to his successor and discussing his post-presidential life at the end of his final foreign tour.His historic presidency and charisma have made Obama a rock star on the international scene, even at times when the daily grind of politics dimmed the glow around his election as the United States´ first black president in 2008.Obama spoke to both the American people and the world as he gave his final foreign press conference in Lima, Peru.But ultimately, those two audiences are inseparably linked, he insisted.It was a key message as he prepares to hand over to President-elect Donald Trump -- who has spooked some in the international community with his volatile style and isolationist rhetoric.Several of Obama´s fellow world leaders said an emotional goodbye as they wrapped up a summit.""It´s a great moment, but a sad moment, to have our last meeting,"" said Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.""I am going to miss having Barack around,"" said Canada´s Justin Trudeau, in comments that were tinged with a sense of uncertainty about things to come.Here are some key points from Obama´s remarks:GlobalizationObama´s last presidential trip was dominated by the deep uncertainty Trump has unleashed about the postwar world order with his attacks on free trade and the US role as ""policeman of the world.""Obama said an increasingly borderless world has brought ""historic gains in prosperity, education and health,"" but acknowledged globalization had both winners and losers.""When jobs and capital can move across borders, when workers have less leverage, when wealthy corporations seem to be playing by a different set of rules, then workers and communities can be hit especially hard,"" he said.""That can reverberate through our politics. That´s why I firmly believe one of our greatest challenges in the years ahead across our nations and within them will be to make sure that the benefits of the global economy are shared.""President TrumpIt was an awkward trip for Obama, who campaigned against Trump as an unfit successor but now wants to reassure US allies on the future.He asked the world to treat the brash billionaire as he himself vowed to do: ""Wait and see.""At the same time, he sought to pre-empt his successor on some key issues.He announced his signature trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific, the TPP, was still alive despite Trump´s vows to kill it, and said he wanted to reach a deal on the Ukraine crisis before leaving office.He said Trump´s presidency would likely be far different from his candidacy.""Once you´re in the Oval Office, once you begin interacting with world leaders, once you see the complexities of the issues, that has a way of shaping your thinking,"" Obama said.SyriaThe brutal war in Syria has been the most difficult foreign policy challenge of Obama´s eight years in the White House.He defended is decision not to invade the country, but warned no end to the bloodshed was in sight.""I am not optimistic about the short term prospects in Syria,"" he said, blaming Russian and Iranian support for the Bashar al-Assad regime.""Assad has been emboldened. This is man who has decided that destroying his country, turning it to rubble and seeing its population scattered or killed was worth it for him to cling to power,"" he said.""At this stage, we´re going to need to have a change in how all parties think about this.""LegacyObama voiced regret that, despite high approval ratings, he was stymied on issues like gun control, a minimum wage increase and infrastructure spending.But he defended the values of his presidency.""The touchstone is what´s good for the American people,"" he said.""At the end of the day and at the end of eight years, I can look back and say that I consistently did what I thought was best. Doesn´t mean you don´t make mistakes. But it means you´re being true to your oath and the commitments you made to the people who elected you.""Life after presidencyObama was clear about his first priority for post-presidential life: ""Take (First Lady) Michelle on vacation.""The president said he wants to ""get some rest, spend time with my girls and do some writing, do some thinking.""He does not plan to immediately wade back into politics.""I want to be respectful of the office and give the president-elect an opportunity to put forward his platform,"" he said.But Obama didn´t rule it out altogether.""As an American citizen who cares deeply about our country, if there´s specifics that have less to do with some proposal or battle but goes to core questions about our values and our ideals, and if I think that it´s necessary or helpful for me to defend those ideals then I´ll examine it when it comes,"" he said."
190,"LONDON: Moeen Ali again proved England´s hero with the bat as they beat West Indies by six runs in a rain-marred fourth one-day international at The Oval to go an unbeatable 3-0 up with one to play in the series.England, without Ben Stokes after he was dropped following his arrest, were on course for defeat at 181 for five chasing 357 to win.But Ali, fresh from his match-winning century in the third ODI at Bristol on Sunday, made an unbeaten 48 off 25 balls including six fours and two sixes.Together with Jos Buttler (43 not out), he added 77 in eight overs.England were ahead under D/L when rain stopped play with their score on 258 for five off 35.1 oversYet the match might have been beyond them had Evin Lewis, who made a stunning 176, not retired hurt in the 47th over after deflecting a Jake Ball delivery onto his right ankle.It was later announced that man-of-the-match Lewis, who had to be wheeled off the field on a stretcher and went to hospital without fielding, had suffered a hairline fracture that would sideline him for at least two weeks.Defeat was also tough on West Indies paceman Alzarri Joseph, who took all of England´s wickets during an ODI best haul of five for 56.""Evin set the tone for us up front,"" said West Indies captain Jason Holder. ""Unfortunately he was unable to bat in the last few overs.""It´s not often one guy scores 170, another gets five wickets and you lose the game.""Lewis´s innings, which surpassed his previous ODI hundred of 148 against Sri Lanka in Bulawayo in November last year, was the cornerstone of West Indies´ 356 for five.He was eyeing a double century until his freak injury left him writhing in agony.The 25-year-old Trinidad left-hander remained unbeaten, having faced 130 balls including 17 fours and seven sixes.His innings was the fourth highest in ODIs by a West Indies batsman.The Windies had slumped to 33 for three following Chris Woakes´s treble strike that included the fourth ball exit of Lewis´s fellow left-handed opener Chris Gayle who made a dashing 94 in Bristol.This match took place just hours after England unveiled their Ashes squad.They knew they would be without all-rounder Stokes -- included in the Ashes party and retained as Test vice-captain -- after his arrest in the early hours of Monday morning.Stokes, who has a broken finger, remains under investigation after being released without charge.Victorious England captain Eoin Morgan told reporters there might need to be a re-think regarding nights out.""We´ve always policed it ourselves, (but) it´s something we´re going to look into -- in light of what´s happened -- because we need to look after each other as a team,"" he said.As for the match, Morgan said: ""Evin Lewis played well. We were up against it, but it was an extremely confident innings (from Ali)."" Lewis completed a chanceless century, off 94 balls.Often billed as Gayle´s heir apparent, Lewis -- a far shorter and less muscular batsman -- hit two sixes in as many balls off fast bowler Liam Plunkett, the second a magnificent straight drive.He was missed on 122 when Jason Roy, running back from cover, dropped a tough chance.Roy, only recalled after fellow opener Alex Hales was omitted together with Stokes after the pair were out late prior to the latter´s arrest, cashed in with 84 on his Surrey home ground.His 66-ball innings ended when he was caught behind off Joseph to end an opening stand of 126 with Jonny Bairstow (39), who fell in similar fashion.West Indies must have thought it was their night when Joseph took his fifth wicket via a diving slip catch by Gayle, not renowned for his athleticism, that dismissed Sam Billings.But Ali and Buttler, together with the London weather, combined to give England a 15th win in 16 completed ODIs against West Indies."

196,"The Indian government has blocked website for Islamic scholar Dr Zakir Naik’s not-for-profit organization the Islamic Research Foundation.According to reports in the Indian media, it has been decided that the United States will be contacted to block his pages on social media websites.On Saturday, an Indian investigative agency filed an FIR against Islamic preacher Dr Zakir Naik for spreading enmity among religions. Raids were conducted in 10 offices of Naik’s Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) located in Maharashtra, media reports said.Reports in NDTV said that the case was registered after speeches by Naik aired on his channel Peace TV partly funded by IRF were examined.Naik, 50, a medical doctor by profession, is currently in Saudi Arabia.Earlier this month, on the recommendation of Mumbai Police and National Security Agency, the Indian government imposed a five-year ban on IRF.The decision was taken in a cabinet meeting held in New Delhi.Days after militants killed more than 20 hostages in Bangladesh, Indian and Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies launched a probe against the speeches of Naik, whose sermons were said to have allegedly inspired two of the Dhaka attackers.""I disagree that I inspired this act of killing innocent people"" and declared ""terrorism is Devil-ish,"" Naik said.Naik told The Indian Express that he condemns the attack. “By using the name Islamic State, we are condemning Islam… They are the 'anti-Islamic state of Iraq and Syria' that has killed innocent foreigners.

197,"ISLAMABAD: Maria Bibi, 19, started chatting by Facebook first and then moved to call on Telegram with a commander of ultra-extremist militant group, the Islamic State (IS), generally known as Daesh, in Syria earlier this year.She has been watching videos of IS fighters on internet and then slowly but gradually convinced by a Syria based Daesh commander Qari Abid to wage ‘jihad’ with her husband. Following the teachings of Qari Abid, she finally convinced her young husband Tanzeel Ahmed, 17, to join the Daesh fighters in Syria last month. After embracing caliphate of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi through Qari Abid on Facebook, the young couple planned their trip for Syria via Iran and Turkey.“She [Maria] is just one of 14 Pakistanis who have joined IS/Daesh in Syria and Afghanistan [last month],” revealed a three-page highly confidential report prepared by law enforcing agencies assigned to eliminate footprints of Daesh in Pakistan.Shocking revelations were collected from a dozen militants of Daesh who were arrested by law enforcement agencies in Lahore last week. It happened at a time the Pakistani authorities claimed that there was no such support for the IS in the country.“Daesh commander Qari Abid through agents in Pakistan, Turkey and Afghanistan used social media [Facebook and Telegram channels] to convince young people to join IS,” revealed the secret report, also exclusively made available with Geo TV (ASKKS Programme)/The News.Qari Abid, through his nephew Nabeel Ahmed, alias Abu Abdullah [in Pakistan], funded the militants who wanted to fight in Syria, the report revealed. Then Nabeel Ahmed had a contact with another Daesh Commander Shahzeb in Turkey who put himself in touch with likeminded people in Pakistan to travel to Turkey via Iran (mostly as pilgrims to Shia holy sites) and through there to Turkey.Qari Abid has had a network of agents in Turkey and Iran, who helped these militants cross into Syria. Some of them travelled to Jalalabad, where Nabeel’s younger brother Tanzeel Ahmed and his cousin Muhammad Yasin alias Imran were their handlers. Yasin and Tanzeel were already there with their families and kids and carrying out attacks in Afghanistan with the IS fighters. The Daesh fighters had already carried out many robberies in Punjab and kidnappings of Shias to raise funds, revealed the report.Official documents also revealed Qari Abid of Badami Bagh, Hameed Ahmed of Makhan Pura and Hafiz Umer of Shad Bagh left Lahore to join Daesh in Syria. Later, Tayyeb alias Abu Ahmed of Islamabad, Hafiz Tanveer and Abdullah Attique of Sialkot city and Abdul Azeem also left for Syria. Those militants who joined Daesh in Afghanistan are: Tanzeel Ahmed of Cantonment Area, Lahore, Zarmina Tanzeel of Lahore, Yasin alias Imran of Gujranwala, Samia wife of Yasin, Tahir Bhatti from Sialkot city and Ibrahim Lahori from Lahore travelled to Afghanistan.Officials of the Counter Terrorism Department in Punjab not only confirmed that these militants had joined Daesh in Syria and Afghanistan but also revealed they got the information from activists of Daesh who were about to leave for Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan last week. The Punjab CTD arrested the eight-member group of Nabeel alias Abu Abdullah alias Irtat by detecting them through social media in Lahore, also killing a Daesh commander in Rawalpindi Division last week. “We’ve arrested over a dozen militants who were traveling abroad to join hands with the IS,” a senior CTD official told Geo News.“We’ve recovered weapons, literature of IS, stickers against Pakistan Army, laptops with IS videos and literature from their possession, which they were using for recruiting more young people and enhancing their capabilities,” the official, who did not want to be named, further revealed. The arrested Daesh fighters belonged to the heart of Lahore. They are: Nabeel Ahmed alias Abu Abdullah and his wife Khadeeja Bibi, Abdullah Dar, Muhammad Iqbal his wife Raqia Bano and daughter Iqra Iqbal, Yousaf al Islam, Badr-ul-Islam and Abu Bakkar alias Sarmad and his wife Aqsa, Haq Nawaz, Hafiz Raheel, Muhammad Anwar, Javeria wife of Tayyeb alias Abu Ahmed and Amna Bibi wife of Qari Abid.

207,"ISLAMABAD: Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Wednesday said that the Daesh flag was put up in Islamabad to distract the government.   Chaudhry reiterated Nisar’s stance on the presence of Daesh group in Pakistan and rubbished claims about the terrorist group's presence in the country. ""We have been informed that the [Daesh] flag was put up to distract [the government],"" Chaudhry said. “A special investigation team has been formed to probe the incident.”The Senate Standing Committee on Interior demanded a detailed report regarding the appearance of a militant Daesh group’s flag in Islamabad’s suburbs last week.Senator Mukhtiar Ahmed Dhamra expressed serious concern over the country’s security situation in the meeting.“The former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar had denied the presence of Daesh group in the country, yet the group's flag was hoisted in Islamabad,” Senator Dhamra said.The committee approved the law to install close-circuit cameras in the markets and trade centres of the capital. "
208,"DUBAI: World Cup 2022 host Qatar must urgently introduce laws to protect the lives of up to 800,000 migrant construction labourers working in scorching temperatures, Human Rights Watch said Wednesday.The New York-based organisation also called on the Gulf state to investigate workers´ deaths and make those findings public.""The Qatari authorities' failure to put in place the most basic protection from the heat, their decision to ignore recommendations that they investigate worker deaths, and their refusal to release data on these deaths, constitutes a willful abdication of responsibility,"" said report author Nicholas McGeehan.He also called on football's world governing body, FIFA, national associations and World Cup sponsors to demand further protection from heat and humidity for Qatar's workers.McGeehan added: ""They should also be demanding answers to two simple questions - how many workers have died since 2012 and how they have died?""Qatar has introduced laws to stop people working outside between 11:30 am and 3:00 pm annually from June 15 to August 31, when temperatures can reach around 50 degrees Celsius.But HRW says these measures do not go far enough.""Limiting work temperatures to safe temperatures - not set by a clock or calendar - is well within the capacity of the Qatari government and will help protect hundreds of thousands of workers,"" said Sarah Leah Whitson.Temperatures in Qatar are currently in the high 30s Celsius and humidity levels are above 50 percent.The HRW says medical research suggests heat stress is a genuine risk to those working outside, and it has called for greater flexibility by Qatari authorities.In rare praise for Qatar's World Cup organisers, it said the government should follow the example of compulsory work-to-rest ratios introduced for the 12,000 helping build venues for 2022.""If Qatar's World Cup organisers can mandate a climate-based work ban, then the Qatar government can follow its lead,"" added Whitson.However, it called for much greater transparency by Doha on the vexed issue of worker deaths.It said figures were last made available in 2012.Out of the 520 deaths then for workers from Bangladesh, India and Nepal, 385, or 74 per cent, were ""neither explained nor investigated"".The HRW said there had been 10 deaths reported by World Cup organisers between October 2015 and July 2017, eight classified as ""non-work related""."
209,"MOSCOW: Russia and the United States agreed Wednesday to cooperate on a NASA-led project to build the first lunar space station, part of a long-term project to send humans to Mars.The US space agency said earlier this year that it was exploring a programme called the Deep Space Gateway, a multi-stage project to push further into the solar system.The project envisages building a crew-tended spaceport in lunar orbit that would serve as a ""gateway to deep space and the lunar surface,"" NASA has said.And on Wednesday the Russian space agency Roscosmos announced that a cooperation agreement had been signed at an astronautical congress in Adelaide.""The partners intend to develop international technical standards which will be used later, in particular to create a space station in lunar orbit,"" the Russian agency said in a statement.The Russians and Americans would cooperate to build the systems needed to organise scientific missions in lunar orbit and to the surface of the Moon, the agency added.""NASA has already agreed on standards for a docking unit of the future station. Taking into account the country's extensive experience in developing docking units, the station's future elements will be created using Russian designs."" Igor Komarov, Roscosmos´s general director, said no fewer than five countries were building their own rockets and systems.""To avoid future problems over technical cooperation, part of the standards should be unified - for a possibility for various countries to work on their craft and dock to the international lunar station,"" Komarov was quoted as saying in the statement.Russia and the United States also discussed using Moscow's Proton-M and Angara rockets to help create the infrastructure of the lunar spaceport, the statement said, adding that the main works were slated to begin in the mid-2020s.Space exploration - including joint work on the International Space Station (ISS) - is one of the few areas where international cooperation between Russia and the US has not been wrecked by tensions over Ukraine and Syria.The $100 billion ISS, which has been orbiting Earth at about 28,000 kilometres (17,000 miles) per hour since 1998, is the world´s largest space project."
210,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s latest fast bowling sensation Shaheen Shah achieved yet another feat on Wednesday by taking eight wickets in an innings on his First Class debut.17-year-old Shaheen, hailing from Khyber Agency, made his first-class debut in the Quaid-e-Azam trophy on Tuesday and on Wednesday, announced his arrival by taking eight wickets, giving 39 runs.This is the best-ever performance by any Pakistani player on his first-class debut, previous best by a Pakistani was 8 for 58 by Nadeem Malik for Lahore against Sargodha in 1974.Of Shaheen’s eight wickets, three were bowled, two being trapped leg-before-wicket, and one being caught behind which reflects his disciplined bowling at the match.Shaheen was spotted at an Under-16 talent hunt program last year and was included in Pakistan’s U19 team for U19 Asia Cup.Videos of his smooth bowling action went viral earlier and he was tipped as Pakistan’s version of Mitchell Starc.His natural swing is in-swing to right-handers but he can also bowl away from the right-handers. When he was put on the speed gun during PCB U16 camp last year, he was consistently hitting 135+ kmh and occasionally 140+ kmh, and he was just 16 at the time.The bowler earlier got a two-year BPL contract with Dhaka Dynamites."

They are liabilities, I accept that they are liabilities. But give us time to get rid of these liabilities. You are increasing our liabilities further,"" said Asif.""Don't blame us for Haqqanis, don't blame us for Hafiz Saeeds. These were the people who were your darlings....20 or 30 years back. They were being dined and wined in the White House,"" added the foreign minister.""You cannot divorce history from the present or the future.""On a question regarding Hafiz Saeed, Asif said that he was already under detention. ""You have mentioned a name. It's a proscribed organisation. The gentleman is under house arrest. But I agree with you that on that score, on that account, we have to do more,"" he said.""There are people in Pakistan who can be a liability in times of crisis for Pakistan and for the region.""The Pakistani government has placed Hafiz Saeed under house arrest, which was extended by two months in August. He was also placed on the Exit Control List along with 37 others in February, all of whom were said to be affiliated with the Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) or Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).According to the interior ministry, JuD, LeT, and the Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF) are ""on the Watch List as per UNSC 1267 Sanctions"", and in ""the Second Schedule of the ATA 1997 (as amended)"".Earlier in his speech prior to the session, Foreign Minister Khaja Asif said that Pakistan cannot be blamed for issues plaguing Afghanistan. He added that India cannot term the genuine struggle of Kashmiris as terrorism.

213,"Pop sensation Momina Mustehsan has made it to BBC’s list of 100 inspirational women of 2017 from across the globe.“The women on the list will be part of the 100 Women Challenge, tackling some of the biggest problems facing women around the world,” BBC reported. “Coming together in four teams, the women will create innovate ways to tackle the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, street harassment and sexism in sports.” Mustehsan, a rising star in the world of music from Pakistan, is so far the only woman from the country on the list that has yet to fill 40 spaces. She told the news outlet the quote that helped her most in life: “It only gets better when you get better.” The 25-year-old singer said she found the quote inside a fortune cookie when she was binge-eating through depression. “That [quote] woke me up.” Besides being a singer, Mustehsan is an engineer and an ambassador for a cricket team, Islamabad United of Pakistan Super League.

214,"OSLO: Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi is the latest in a long line of Nobel Peace Prize laureates to disappoint many of those who once applauded her, and probably won’t be the last, a cautionary tale for the 2017 laureate who will be named next week.Suu Kyi is facing international criticism, including from fellow peace prize winner Desmond Tutu, for not doing more to stop what the UN says are mass killings, rapes and the burning of villages taking place in Rakhine state. The violence has forced 421,000 Rohingya Muslims into neighboring Bangladesh.That is a turnaround from 1991, when the Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded her the prize and praised “her non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights”. Once awarded, the prize cannot be withdrawn.“This has happened many times before that laureates have been criticized,” said Professor Geir Lundestad, who was the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 1990 to 2014.Lundestad said the prize remains a force for good, even if some winners later fall short of its ideals: “Aung Sang Suu Kyi was a very important spokeswoman for human rights in Burma and much of Asia. You cannot take that away from her.”The Nobel prizes were established by Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, whose fortune came in part from making and selling arms. A number of winners of the peace prize have gone on to launch wars or escalate them.Israeli leader Menachem Begin ordered the invasion of Lebanon in 1982, four years after sharing the Nobel with Egypt’s Anwar Sadat for their Camp David peace accord. Sadat was assassinated by an Islamist army officer in 1981.Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat shared the 1994 prize with Israel’s Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for the Oslo accords, which have not brought a lasting settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Rabin was assassinated by a far-right nationalist in 1995 and Peres was voted out of office eight months later. Arafat later presided over the Palestinians during the second intifada, a violent uprising against Israeli occupation.Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, awarded the prize in 1990 for his role in bringing the Cold War to a peaceful end, sent tanks in 1991 to try to stop the independence of the Baltic countries, though he later let them become independent.US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger shared the 1973 prize with North Vietnam’s Le Duc Tho for what turned out to be failed efforts to end the Vietnam War. Tho declined the award, the only laureate ever to do so, accusing Washington of violating the truce. The war ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon to the North Vietnamese.When US President Barack Obama won in 2009 just months after taking office, even he said he was surprised. By the time he came to Oslo to collect the prize at the end of the year, he had ordered the tripling of US troops in Afghanistan.“I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated,” he said in his speech. “I‘m responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land. Some will kill, and some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict.”Even saints face criticism. Mother Teresa, the 1979 Nobel winner canonized by Pope Francis last year, was faulted in 1994 by British medical journal The Lancet for offering neither diagnoses nor strong painkillers to dying patients in her Calcutta hospice.The decision to give the award in 2012 to the European Union was criticized at the time. Brussels was then imposing tough financial bailout conditions on member Greece that many economists said destroyed livelihoods. Tutu, among others, also faulted the EU as an organisation that uses military force.The risk of disappointment arises because Nobel committees pick laureates for the hope they carry or a recent achievement, rather than the sum of a career, said Asle Sveen, a historian of the Nobel Peace Prize.“It is an always a risk when they promote somebody because they are getting involved in politics,” he told Reuters. “And they cannot predict what is going to happen in the future.”“That is what makes the Nobel Peace Prize different from all the other peace prizes,” said Sveen. “Otherwise you would give the prize to very old people just before they die.”Among the favorites are parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, such as Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, EU Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini and John Kerry, the US Secretary of State at the time.Other possible contenders are Pope Francis, Syria’s “White Helmet” rescue crews, the UN refugee agency UNHCR and its high commissioner Filippo Grandi. UNHCR has already won twice.Last year’s prize went to Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end half a century of war that killed a quarter of million people."

216,"MEXICO CITY: Fourteen people were shot dead on Tuesday night at a drug rehabilitation center in northern Mexico as part of a territory fight between two criminal gangs, a spokesman for the state attorney general’s office said.The shooting took place in the Rosario neighborhood of the city of Chihuahua, the capital of the border state Chihuahua, and left 14 people dead and 8 injured, spokesman Carlos Huerta said on Wednesday.“We have an ongoing preliminary investigation wherein we believe it was an attack carried out by a criminal gang fighting for drug territory in the area,” Huerta said.The so-called Aztecas street gang attacked the rehab center where some members of the rival group Los Mexicles, associated with the powerful Sinaloa cartel, were located, Huerta said.The two groups are wings of cartels fighting over drug distribution routes, particularly for crystal meth.Last year, some 23,000 people were killed in violent incidents in Mexico, the deadliest year since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in late 2012.Since then, violence has grown as the country’s powerful drug cartels have splintered and consolidated while fighting ruthlessly for control of lucrative smuggling routes in the United States.Some 1,444 people have been killed so far this year in Chihuahua state alone, Huerta said."
217,"KARACHI: Opposition Leader Khursheed Shah said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi wants to replace party chief Imran Khan, in a statement issued on Wednesday.Shah remarked: “Shah Mehmood Qureshi is not targeting my position rather he wants to sideline Imran Khan.”“How can anyone ask for a bigger post than this party head?” Shah asked and shared “When Bilawal announced to become a part of the National Assembly, I said that Bilawal should become the opposition leader.”If Shah Mehmood Qureshi becomes the opposition leader then it will be a huge conspiracy against Imran, he added. “I have been saying time and again that a conspiracy is being hatched against Imran and not me.”A large number of PTI members, including Jahangir Tareen, are opposed to Qureshi's nomination, sources saySpeaking on whether he is nervous about his current post, he said “I am not worried, I believe in democracy. Imran should be worried about himself.”He also demanded that PTI should be open about their reasons for wanting to change the opposition leader. People they [PTI] have gone to ask for votes have also questioned PTI’s decision, remarked Shah.PTI leaders talk about democracy but are not willing to accept Pakistan People Party’s majority, Shah added.Shah, while speaking on Geo News programme Aaj Shahzaib Khanzada Kay Sath, reiterated his earlier claims and said that he doesn't understand PTI's decision to challenge opposition leader. He remarked that PTI leaders are trying to fulfill some other agenda through this move. ""The matter pertains to PTI's internal war."" Qureshi is trying to think of all the ways he can push Imran Khan back in the party politics, he added. On Tuesday, a delegation of PTI, including Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Firdous Shamim among others, met with the leaders of Muttahida Quami Movement-Pakistan.According to sources, the leaders of the two parties mulled over the possibility of replacing Pakistan Peoples Party stalwart Khursheed Shah as the leader of opposition in the National Assembly, before the caretaker government steps in ahead of 2018 General Elections.The leaders of the two parties mulled over the possibility of replacing Khursheed Shah with Shah Mehmood QureshiReports suggest that PTI has started making efforts to replace the opposition leader with its own senior member, Shah Mehmood Qureshi.The caretaker government is set up in consultation between the opposition and the present government.PTI officials said if all the opposition parties unite against the PPP then a new opposition leader can emerge in the Lower House of Parliament."

219,"FRANKFURT: Germany's blue-chip companies will have to explain to Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday why they have managed to hire fewer than 100 refugees after around a million arrived in the country last year.Merkel, fighting for her political life over her open-door policy, has summoned the bosses of some of Germany's biggest companies to Berlin to account for their lack of action and exchange ideas about how they can do better.Many of the companies say a lack of German-language skills, the inability of most refugees to prove any qualifications, and uncertainty about their permission to stay in the country mean there is little they can do in the short term.A survey by Reuters of the 30 companies in Germany's DAX stock market index found they could point to just 63 refugee hires in total. Several of the 26 firms who responded said they considered it discriminatory to ask about applicants' migration history, so they did not know whether they employed refugees or how many.Of the 63 hires, 50 are employed by Deutsche Post DHL, which said it applied a ""pragmatic approach"" and deployed the refugees to sort and deliver letters and parcels.""Given that around 80 percent of asylum seekers are not highly qualified and may not yet have a high level of German proficiency, we have primarily offered jobs that do not require technical skills or a considerable amount of interaction in German,"" a spokesman said by email.What is clear is that early optimism that the wave of migrants could boost economic growth and help ease a skills shortage in Germany - where the working-age population is projected to shrink by 6 million people by 2030 - is evaporating.""The employment of refugees is no solution for the skills shortage,"" industrial group Thyssenkrupp's Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger said during a visit by the German president earlier this month.Apprenticeship barriersMost large German companies, especially those in manufacturing, prefer to hire through structured apprenticeship programs, in which they train young people for up to four years for highly skilled and sometimes company-specific jobs.But the recent arrivals from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere are mainly ill-prepared for such training, they say.The DAX companies surveyed by Reuters were able to identify 190 apprentices in this or last year's intake.Many will have been through months of pre-training especially designed for migrants by large companies like engineering group Siemens, Mercedes maker Daimler or automotive technology firm Continental.Two Syrian interns whom Reuters visited at a Siemens power-plant construction site in April applied for apprenticeships but were turned down because they could not sufficiently prove their school-leaving qualifications. One is now doing temporary work in IT and the other is taking further German classes.It's simply too soon to expect large numbers of refugees to have been hired yet, most German companies say.""Our experience is that it takes a minimum of 18 months for a well trained refugee to go through the asylum procedure and learn German at an adequate level in order to apply for a job,"" said a spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, which plans to take on about 75 refugees as apprentices this year but has not made a permanent hire.Others among Germany's top listed companies, mainly in the financial or airline sectors, say it is practically impossible for them to take on refugees at all. They cite regulatory reasons such as the need for detailed background checks on staff.'Totally motivated'Many large companies see the main benefits of the migrant influx as an opportunity to introduce more diversity into their workforce and to bring their staff into personal contact with refugees. More than 1,000 internships have been offered by the companies surveyed by Reuters.""Refugees working at SAP are totally motivated, and this motivates our colleagues to support them,"" Uli Joos, project leader for refugees at Europe's biggest software company SAP, told Reuters in an interview.Reuters visited SAP five months ago to meet then-intern Somar Abraham, a Syrian refugee who arrived in Germany in 2013 with a university degree from his homeland in computer systems engineering. He has since been hired for a full-time job, along with four other refugees.About 346,000 people with asylum status were seeking jobs in Germany in August, according to the latest figures from the German Labor Office, up from 322,000 in July and 297,000 in June, the first month for which it published such statistics.Economists say that most refugees who have found employment are in the services sector, often in smaller companies or in smaller towns and cities to which refugees are dispersed under a strict German formula for allocating new arrivals according to the wealth and population of states and districts.""Obviously, in the low-skilled segment, mobility is low, Germans often won't go very far to find a low-skilled job. Now you have these refugees on your doorstep,"" said Thomas Liebig, an economist at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development who has specialized in migration for the past 15 years.""Will Germany manage?"" he said, referring to Merkel's mantra ""We can do this."" ""There's basically not a choice. The people are here."""
220,"BEIJING/TAIPEI: China on Wednesday warned Taiwan not to allow exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to visit, after a high-profile Taiwan legislator invited him to the self-ruled island Beijing claims as its own, a trip that would worsen already poor ties.China regards the 80-year-old monk as a separatist. Taiwan's former president, Ma Ying-jeou, who favored close economic ties with China, refused the Dalai Lama entry several times after his last visit to Taiwan in 2009.On that occasion, Ma allowed him in but did not meet him.Taiwan's new president, Tsai Ing-wen, elected in January, has not said whether the government would allow a visit by the Dalai Lama, who congratulated Tsai on her ""remarkable"" victory.Freddy Lim, one of Taiwan's most famous heavy-metal singers and an outspoken critic of Beijing, who was elected to parliament in January, invited the Dalai Lama when he met him in India last week.Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, told a regular news briefing in Beijing that the Dalai Lama ""wears religious clothes to carry out separatist activities"".""The intention of some forces in Taiwan to collude with separatists seeking 'Tibet independence' and to create disturbances will have a severe impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait,"" Ma said. ""We firmly oppose any form of visit.""Lim's assistant, Kenny Chang, told Reuters the Dalai Lama was highly respected in Taiwan.""Lim is inviting him to visit Taiwan to share his ideas and religious philosophy,"" Chang said.On Tuesday, Taiwan Foreign Minister David Lee told lawmakers that if the Dalai Lama decided to come, the ministry would review the matter carefully, media reported.A Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman told Reuters: ""If he submits his (visa) application, our government will handle it based on relevant rules"". She did not elaborate.China is suspicious of Tsai and her pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, even as Tsai insists she wants to maintain peace with China.In June, China stopped a communication mechanism with Taiwan because of the refusal of the government to recognize the ""one China"" principle, and relations have continued to deteriorate.China claims Taiwan as its own and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under its control. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to the island at the end of a civil war with the Communists in 1949.The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989, fled into exile in India in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Communist rule.Tenzin Taklha, an aide to the Dalai Lama in Dharamsala, India, the seat of a Tibetan government in exile, declined to comment when reached by telephone.The Dalai Lama, who is visiting Europe, says he wants genuine autonomy for his Himalayan homeland."

We have got to be brave. You have got to take the game on,” he said in an interview to ESPNcricinfo.  Mickey Arthur expressed frustration over Mohammad Irfan’s fitness, saying that he was a good bowler but clearly not fit to play ODI cricket. He added that fitness is the most important criterion for one-day cricket.""Fitness is the biggest problem plaguing Pakistan team,"" he said, adding that whoever does not meet the fitness standards will be dropped from the side.He said he would need to make some tough decisions for the betterment of the team.The coach further said Azhar Ali is a good batsman and is grooming with time. He also praised Shoaib Malik’s recent performance, noting the batsman’s innings of 77 against England at Cardiff in the final ODI of the series.Mickey Arthur said he is trying to streamline Pakistan cricket and that he hoped the Pakistan Cricket Board would allow him time to do so.There are only 14 ODIs scheduled before the September 30, 2017 deadline. If Pakistan fail to improve their ranking they would be required to compete in a qualifying tournament in April 2018. Ten teams would go in but only two teams would go through.Pakistan's number nine ranking in ODIs is in sharp contrast to the team's top ranking in Tests. The ICC will present the Test mace to Test captain Misbah-ul-Haq on September 21."
222,"DUBAI: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) will lead the redevelopment of Jeddah’s waterfront corniche in an 18 billion riyal ($4.8 billion) project that will include housing, shops, museums and a marina, the sovereign fund said on Wednesday.The project, to be built over 10 years, is part of economic reform plans that seek to move Saudi Arabia’s economy beyond dependence on oil exports by expanding industries such as tourism and entertainment.The PIF, which is the country’s main sovereign wealth fund and is believed to have about $180 billion of assets, is being mobilized to support many such projects. Its statement did not specify how much money the PIF would invest or how much would come from other investors including the private sector.Jeddah, Saudi Arabia’s commercial capital, is the largest port city on the Red Sea and the main gateway to Makkah, but its appeal to tourists has been limited by haphazard urban planning and a lack of public transport. The government plans a metro system for the city.The PIF’s waterfront project will have an area of 5 million square meters (54 million square feet) and include hotels as well as 12,000 housing units. Construction is due to start in 2019 with the first phase of the project likely to open in the final quarter of 2022, the PIF said."
223,"KARACHI: City authorities continued cleaning work on the second day of Eid ul Azha. While some parts of the city were cleared of the animal waste, other areas remained littered with the remains.Most of the main roads in Karachi have been cleaned up; however, various residential areas across the city continue to be littered with the animal waste, which is polluting the environment and posing difficulties to the residents.Piles of animal waste were found under a bridge near Karachi’s Jail Chowrangi. According to the area’s councillor, dumping sites were few and far and so people heaped the animal waste under the bridge. Similar situation was found in Kehkashan Society Malir Halt, Nazimabad, Federal B. Area and other areas.Earlier Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) leader Farooq Sattar lauded Karachi’s mayor, deputy mayor and municipal workers on the cleaning arrangements.Meanwhile Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) leader Raza Haroon urged the Sindh government to ensure cleanliness of the city and criticized Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, saying it had failed to remove the animal remains from the metropolis.He further cautioned that diseases could spread if the waste was not removed promptly, especially from under the flyovers.Animal waste could also be seen dotting Lahore, Peshawar and other cities. Local authorities have not yet been able to clean up the cities entirely.Islamabad mayor Sheikh Ansar Aziz visited different sectors of the capital where he reviewed the cleaning arrangements in place.

225,"KARACHI: Flamboyant all-rounder and former captain Shahid Afridi has said that he wants to retire on a high note but has never requested the PCB to give him a farewell series before retiring from the game.Reports suggest that PCB, on request of Afridi, is considering to include him for West Indies series to make it a farewell series for him and providing him opportunity to retire with the series.However, Afridi neither denied nor confirmed the report.“I have discussed my plans with the chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq and he has discussed his and board’s plans with me,” the former captain said.“I want to quit on a high note, if I wanted to retire just randomly then I would have done it after World T20 in India,” he added.The former captain said that whatever would come-out between him and PCB, it will leave a good precedent for the future of Pakistan Cricket.“I am not under any pressure from board to take West Indies series and retire, neither am I pressurizing the PCB. Whatever will be done, it will be in better interest of the Pakistan Cricket,” he added.“I want to leave Cricket respectfully, something which is unprecedented in Pakistan as not too many players have left Cricket with grace. I will opt for something which is graceful for both – me and PCB,” the former captain said.Afridi, a veteran of 98 T20Is, had last year announced retirement from ODIs, earlier in 2010 he left Test Cricket, but despite quitting Pakistan’s captaincy from T20s after World T20 this year, he insisted on continuing as a player in the shortest format."

227,"UNITED NATIONS: The deteriorating situation in Indian-occupied Kashmir has now made it crucial to establish an independent, impartial and international mission to assess the situation, the UN human rights chief has said, while regretting India’s lack of response to his request for access to its controlled part of the disputed state.UN rights chief Zeid Raad al-Hussein told the Geneva-based Human Rights Council that he received a letter from the Government of Pakistan on Sept 9 formally inviting a team from his office to visit Azad Kashmir but only in tandem with a mission to the Indian side.“I have yet to receive a formal letter from the government of India. I therefore request here and publicly, from the two governments, access that is unconditional to both sides of the Line of Control,” he said.“Two months ago, I requested the agreement of the governments of India and Pakistan to invite teams from my office to visit both sides of the Line of Control."" Zeid said in remarks delivered on Tuesday at the opening session of HRC.“We furthermore received conflicting narratives from the two sides as to the cause for the confrontations and the reported large numbers of people killed and wounded. I believe an independent, impartial and international mission is now needed crucially and that it should be given free and complete access to establish an objective assessment of the claims made by the two sides,” he said.The top UN official also said that they continue receiving reports of Indian forces using force excessively against civilian population under its administration.The Indian government has been coming under growing pressure over the level of casualties in the region during protests against Indian rule, which broke out after the death of a popular separatist leader on July 8 during a gun-battle with soldiers."

230,"KABUL: For archaeologists Afghanistan, rich in ancient treasures and once a key stop on the legendary silk road, is an ""open-air museum"", albeit one ravaged by war and plagued by looters.After 30 years of conflicts, Afghanistan's cultural heritage is in dire straits, but one group of archaeologists is trying to put the country's historical sites back on the map - literally.An international team is working to map the country's numerous sites and monuments with satellite imaging into a huge database -- a giant geographic information system (GIS).""The authorities have long feared encouraging looting by locating such sites... In fact, most have already been looted, "" says Julio Bendezu-Sarmiento, a French-Peruvian archaeologist who heads the French Archaeological Delegation to Afghanistan (DAFA).The project is going ahead now because ""it is often the looters who are best informed about where the archaeological sites are,"" he adds, so a database will not affect this.Afghanistan's location and the variety and abundance of its bountiful mines of gold, copper and precious stones make it an archaeological holy grail. The Afghan lapis-lazuli, a brilliant blue semi-precious gemstone, was used as decoration by the Egyptian pharaohs and the great kings of Assyria and Babylon, Bendezu-Sarmiento notes.In DAFA's offices a large satellite image of the country, with its bust bowls, deep valleys and steep mountains, is shown on a widesceen display. Heritage sites are indicated by yellow, blue and red dots depending on whether they have been excavated, identified or only recently discovered.The work consists of linking this mapping to each site in the database.In 1982, under pressure from Soviet Russia which had invaded Afghanistan, DAFA -- who had been there since 1922 -- had to leave the country where they'd identified 1,286 heritage sites.""Today, we've identified five times that,"" Bendezu-Sarmiento says.On the map, there are numerous marks as the archaeologists try to connect information from the first excavations in the 1930s.""The country is huge, with an enormous wealth of sites,"" says Elena Leoni, an Italian archaeologist specialising in Central Asia and GIS.Leoni gives the example of the historical town of Balkh in northern Afghanistan, known to the ancient Greeks as Bactra, where an incredible amount of gold was discovered.Often compared to the famed treasures discovered in the burial chamber of Egyptian king Tutankhamun, ""L'Or de Balkh"" is shown all over the world as part of a touring exhibition.Thomas Lorain, the organisation's scientific secretary adds: ""When one digs, one always stumbles across something.""- Copper vs. Buddhas -Mohamed Nader Rassouli, a consultant at DAFA who is esteemed by his colleagues as a living ""library of Afghan archaeology"" and studied the subject in Russia in the 1960s, has seen his country's vast cultural heritage tragically squandered.""Houses have been built over the sites around Kabul that DAFA excavated in 1937,"" he laments.""And in the provinces, sites have been destroyed by looters and antiquities traffickers as well as people simply working in the fields,"" he adds.For the Afghan authorities, the archaeological map will also serve as a tool for ministries to launch major development projects, explains Haroon Hakimi, spokesman for the ministry of culture.""People say Afghanistan is an open-air museum,"" he says. ""It is vital to identify these sites, then you know where they are when you want to build roads, operate mines or drill for oil.""This is especially important as the government is in the process of distributing mining concessions and according to sources plans to sign at least 25 contracts this year.""Interest in mineral resources is not a modern thing and it was the desire to exploit and manage these resources that undoubtedly led to the creation of these great cities,"" Bendezu-Sarmiento says.Mes Aynack, a huge historical site with thousands of Buddhas located south of Kabul, was discovered by a Chinese mining company because of the huge amounts of copper lying beneath the ruins.The Metallurgic Corporation of China agreed to suspend its work there, but Afghan archaeologist Rassouli says many other sites remain at risk.""Once this map is complete, it will be publicly available for people so that they can participate in its protection. Everyone must do their bit,"" Rassouli said."
231,"PARIS: The Gaia space probe, launched in 2013, has mapped more than a billion stars in the Milky Way, vastly expanding the inventory of known stars in our galaxy, the European Space Agency said Wednesday.Released to eagerly waiting astronomers around the world, the initial catalogue of 1.15 billion stars is ""both the largest and the most accurate full-sky map ever produced,"" said French astronomer Francois Mignard, a member of the 450-strong Gaia consortium.In a web-cast press conference at the ESA Astronomy Centre in Madrid, scientists unveiled a stunning map of the Milky Way, including stars up to half a million times feinter than those that can be seen with the naked eye.The images were captured by Gaia´s twin telescopes -- scanning the heavens over and over -- and a billion-pixel camera, the largest ever put into space. The resolution is sharp enough to gauge the diameter of a human hair at a distance of 1,000 kilometres (620 miles), said Anthony Brown, head of the Gaia data processing and analysis team.Gaia maps the position of the Milky Way´s stars in a couple of ways.Not only does it pinpoint their location, the probe -- by scanning each star multiple times -- can plot their movement as well.The data release today includes both kinds of data for some two million stars.But over the course of Gaia´s five-year mission, that catalogue is set to expand 500-fold.Orbiting the Sun 1.5 million kilometres (nearly a million miles) beyond Earth´s orbit, the European probe started collected data in July 2014. "
232,"SEOUL: Samsung said Wednesday it was doing its best to push through a challenging recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, as it offered a software fix to jolt users into returning defective devices. The success of the recall is seen as crucial to Samsung retaining brand trust and loyalty and preventing customers defecting to arch-rival Apple´s new iPhone 7 or cheaper Chinese-made models.The South Korean electronics giant moved quickly earlier this month to suspend sales of its latest large-screen smartphone and announced a recall of 2.5 million units already sold, after faulty batteries caused some handsets to explode during charging.Samsung had advised consumers in 10 countries to trade their handsets for temporary replacement phones provided by the firm until it releases new Note 7s.But many users have snubbed the offer, choosing to wait until the new phones were available, citing the inconvenience of switching devices for an interim period.And different regulatory practices in different countries -- as well as varying reactions from carriers -- have caused a degree of customer uncertainty and confusion that is hampering Samsung´s efforts to get the recall behind it as quickly and painlessly as possible. - No overnight fix - ""It´s not something that can be done overnight,"" said a Samsung spokeswoman.""The process is different for each country because they have different regulations and we also have to talk with the carriers in those countries,"" she said. In an effort to steal a march on Apple, the Note 7 was given an early launch in the key US market, making that a priority for the recall effort.Samsung is working with the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, but has yet to provide a specific date for replacing returned units.""We would like the consumers to receive their new phones quickly and easily but the situation is different for each country and we are doing our best in the given circumstances,"" the Samsung spokeswoman said.In a half-page advert carried by major South Korean newspapers on Wednesday, Samsung announced a Note 7 software update that will limit battery recharges to 60 percent of capacity.It would prevent the phones from overheating, and thus exploding, but would effectively mean a downgrade of the high-end device -- and therefore an incentive to turn it in.The automatic update for South Korean users will take place on September 20, a day after Samsung begins to hand out new Note 7 handsets with fault-free batteries. - ´Deep´ apology - Wednesday´s newspaper ads also carried a message of ""deep, sincere apology"" and a vow to retain the ""love and trust"" of Samsung consumers.The recall comes at a particularly sensitive time, with Samsung´s mobile division finally showing some real momentum after two years of profit growth declines in an increasingly competitive and saturated market.The degree of long-term damage is still difficult to estimate.""The company has acted aggressively to address the problem ... (but) the recall is likely to reverse improving profitability in Samsung´s IT and mobile communications segment over the next one to two quarters,"" credit ratings agency Moody´s said in a statement.The statement noted that the newly launched iPhone 7 smartphone could provide a tempting alternative to disgruntled Samsung consumers, and said the Korean firm might be forced to increase marketing expenses to regain consumer confidence.The mobile business accounts for a major share of profits at Samsung, which is the world´s largest smartphone maker but also produces home appliances and memory chips.Nomura has cut its profit forecast for Samsung´s mobile division in the third quarter by 900 billion won (800 million dollars) to 3.1 trillion won.""Nevertheless we are still positive on the company´s mid-long term competitiveness and earnings forecast mainly due to semi-conductor and display competitiveness,"" Nomura said in a research note. "

Pakistan believes that the promulgation of national laws with extra-territorial application sets a dangerous precedent that is likely to further complicate an already complex global environment. “The statement added, “Pakistan is convinced that the world today is better served through initiatives promoting amity and cooperation, rather than xenophobia and confrontation, particularly, those targeting countries or religions.”The US House of Representatives passed legislation by voice vote on Friday that would allow the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue Saudi Arabia’s government for damages, despite the White House’s threat to veto the measure.The US had Senate passed the ""Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act,"" or JASTA, unanimously in May.  "
236,"COLOMBO: The United Nations on Wednesday raised concern for the safety of Rohingya Muslim asylum seekers in Sri Lanka after Buddhist monks and hardline nationalists forced them to flee a UN shelter in the capital Colombo.The refugees, who were detained in April along with two suspected Indian human traffickers in a boat off Sri Lanka’s coast, are now in a camp in southern Sri Lanka to ensure their security after the incident in the capital.In Tuesday’s incident, the Sri Lankan monks and nationalists stoned the shelter, prompting its 31 Rohingya occupants - mainly women and children - to flee for their own safety, witnesses said. No injuries were reported.In a statement, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the incident was alarming, saying the refugees had been victims of violence and persecution in Myanmar, from which some 422,000 Rohingya have fled to nearby Bangladesh over the past month.“UNHCR emphasises that (the) refugees ... need international protection and assistance. UNHCR urges the public and all those concerned with refugees to continue extending protection and to show empathy for civilians fleeing persecution and violence.”It said the Rohingya had been staying in Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka with the Colombo government’s approval and UNHCR was providing assistance “until longer-term solutions can be found”.President Maithripala Sirisena’s government condemned the attack on the refugees as “shameful” and urged police to hunt down the perpetrators.Witnesses said the monks stormed into the safe house chanting, “Rohingyas are terrorists” and accusing them of having killed Buddhist monks in Myanmar.The Rohingya group fled Myanmar in 2012 and lived in India as refugees for nearly five years before trying to migrate illegally to Sri Lanka, a lawyer representing them told Reuters.Tension between Myanmar’s majority Buddhists and the Rohingya, most of whom are denied citizenship, has exploded several times over the past few years as old enmities, and Buddhist nationalism, surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule.There has been an exodus of Rohingya from Myanmar’s Rakhine state since Aug. 25, when the military launched a crackdown that the United Nations has branded “ethnic cleansing”.The authorities in Myanmar and Bangladesh each see the stateless Muslim minority as the other nation’s problem."
237,"KATHMANDU: A three-year-old girl has been named the new Kumari of Nepal´s capital Kathmandu after her predecessor retired when she reached puberty, continuing an ancient tradition that sees young girls worshipped as ""living goddesses"".Trishna Shakya will be anointed as the new Kumari in a ceremony on Thursday, when she will be taken from her family home to live in a palace in Kathmandu´s ancient Durbar Square where she will be cared for by specially appointed caretakers.She was selected from among four candidates, Uddhav Man Karmacharya, a Hindu priest who attends to the Kumari, told AFP on Tuesday.""She will take her place on the Kumari´s throne after we perform prayers and tantric rituals,"" Karmacharya said.Once she is anointed a living goddess, Shakya -- who, like her predecessors, belongs to the Newar community indigenous to the Kathmandu valley -- will only be allowed to leave her new home 13 times a year on special feast days.She will be paraded through Kathmandu in ceremonial dress and elaborate makeup to be worshipped.When outside, the Kumari -- who is considered an embodiment of the Hindu goddess Taleju -- is carried because her feet are not allowed to touch the ground.Selection criteria for aspiring Kumaris is strict and includes a number of specific physical attributes such as an unblemished body, a chest like a lion and thighs like a deer.Even if a girl fulfills all the physical requirements, she must then prove her bravery by not crying at the sight of a sacrificed buffalo.The Newar tradition blends elements of Hinduism and Buddhism, with the most important Kumaris representing each of the three former royal kingdoms of the Kathmandu Valley: Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur.The practice was historically closely linked to the royal family but has continued despite the end of Nepal´s Hindu monarchy in 2008.The tradition has drawn criticism from child rights activists who say the Kumaris are denied a childhood and their isolation from society hinders their education and development.In 2008, Nepal´s Supreme Court ruled the living goddesses should be educated and they are now taught inside the palace where they live and are allowed to sit their exams there.Many former Kumaris have spoken about the struggles they face reintegrating into society after they are dethroned.The outgoing Kumari, Matine Shakya, was anointed in 2008 at the age of three.But the number of girls being put forward by their families to be selected as a Kumari has dwindled in recent years."

251,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL: Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said on Tuesday that Kurds had voted “yes” to independence in a referendum held in defiance of the government in Baghdad and which had angered their neighbors and their US allies.The Kurds, who have ruled over an autonomous region within Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, consider Monday’s referendum to be an historic step in a generations-old quest for a state of their own.Iraq considers the vote unconstitutional, especially as it was held not only within the Kurdish region itself but also on disputed territory held by Kurds elsewhere in northern Iraq.The United States, major European countries and neighbors Turkey and Iran strongly opposed the decision to hold the referendum, which they described as destabilizing at a time when all sides are still fighting against Islamic State militants.In a televised address, Barzani said the “yes” vote had won and he called on Iraq’s central government in Baghdad to engage in “serious dialogue” instead of threatening the Kurdish Regional Government with sanctions.The Iraqi government earlier ruled out talks on Kurdish independence and Turkey threatened to impose a blockade.“We may face hardship but we will overcome,” Barzani said, calling on world powers “to respect the will of millions of people” who voted in the referendum.Earlier, the Kurdish Rudaw TV channel said an overwhelming majority, possibly over 90 percent, had voted “yes”. Final results are expected by Wednesday.Celebrations continued until the early hours of Tuesday in Erbil, capital of the Kurdish region, which was lit by fireworks and adorned with Kurdish red-white-green flags. People danced in the squares as convoys of cars drove around honking their horns.In ethnically mixed Kirkuk, where Arabs and Turkmen opposed the vote, authorities lifted an overnight curfew imposed to maintain control. Kirkuk, located atop huge oil resources, is outside the Kurdish region but controlled by Kurdish forces that occupied it in 2014 after driving out Islamic State fighters.In neighboring Iran, which also has a large Kurdish minority, thousands of Kurds marched in support of the referendum, defying a show of strength by Tehran which flew fighter jets over their areas.The referendum has fueled fears of a new regional conflict. Turkey, which has fought a Kurdish insurgency within its borders for decades, reiterated threats of economic and military retaliation.Barzani, who is president of the Kurdish Regional Government, has said the vote is not binding, but meant to provide a mandate for negotiations with Baghdad and neighboring countries over the peaceful secession of the region from Iraq.Baghdad said there would be no such talks.“We are not ready to discuss or have a dialogue about the results of the referendum because it is unconstitutional,” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Monday night.Abadi ordered the Kurds to hand over control of their airports to the central government within three days or face an international embargo on flights.Abadi, a moderate from Iraq’s Shi‘ite Arab majority, is coming under pressure at home to take punitive measures against the Kurds. Hardline Iranian-backed Shi‘ite groups have threatened to march on Kirkuk.“We as Popular Mobilisation would be fully prepared to carry out orders from Abadi if he asks to liberate Kirkuk and the oilfields from the separatist militias,” said Hashim al-Mouasawi, a spokesman for the al-Nujabaa paramilitary group.The Kurds, who speak their own language related to Persian, were left without a state of their own when the Ottoman empire crumbled a century ago. Around 30 million are scattered in northern Iraq, southastern Turkey and parts of Syria and Iran.The autonomous region they control in Iraq is the closest the Kurds have come in modern times to a state. It has flourished, largely remaining at peace while the rest of Iraq has been in a continuous state of civil war for 14 years.Since the fall of Saddam, they have had to carefully balance their ambitions for full independence with the threat of a backlash from their neighbors and the reluctance of Washington to redraw borders.In the past four years they achieved a measure of economic independence by opening a route to sell oil through pipelines to a port in Turkey. But that still leaves them at the mercy of Ankara, which draws a firm line at formal independence.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan warned that Iraqi Kurds would go hungry if Turkey imposed sanctions, and said military and economic measures could be used against them.“This referendum decision, which has been taken without any consultation, is treachery,” he said, repeating threats to cut off the pipeline.The Kurds say the referendum acknowledges their contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq.Voters were asked to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question: “Do you want the Kurdistan Region and Kurdistani areas outside the (Kurdistan) Region to become an independent country?”Iraqi soldiers joined Turkish troops for military exercises in southeast Turkey on Tuesday near the border with the Kurdistan region. Turkey also took the Rudaw TV channel off its satellite service TurkSat.Iraq’s Kurds have been close allies of the United States since Washington offered them protection from Saddam in 1991. But the United States has long encouraged the Kurds to avoid unilateral steps so as not to jeopardize the stability of Iraq or antagonize Turkey.The US State Department said it was “deeply disappointed” by the decision to conduct the referendum but Washington’s relationship with region’s people would not change.Asked about the referendum, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Monday: “We hope for a unified Iraq to annihilate ISIS (Islamic State) and certainly a unified Iraq to push back on Iran.”The European Union regretted that the Kurds had failed to heed its call not to hold the referendum and said Iraqi unity remained essential in facing the threat from Islamic State.The Kremlin said Moscow backed the territorial integrity of countries in the region. Unlike other powers, Russia had not directly called on the Kurds to cancel the referendum. Moscow has quietly pledged billions of dollars in investment in the past year, becoming the biggest funders of the Kurds.Iran banned flights to and from Kurdistan on Sunday, while Baghdad asked foreign countries to stop oil trading with the Kurdish region and demanded that the KRG hand over control of its international airports and border posts with Iran, Turkey and Syria.Iranian Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top adviser to the Supreme Leader, called on “the four neighboring countries to block land borders” with the Iraqi Kurdish region, according to state news agency IRNA. Tehran supports Shi‘ite Muslim groups that are powerful in Baghdad.Syria, embroiled in a civil war and whose Kurds are pressing ahead with their own self-determination, also rejected the referendum.KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani said he hoped to maintain good relations with Turkey.“The referendum does not mean independence will happen tomorrow, nor are we redrawing borders,” he said in Erbil on Monday. “If the ‘yes’ vote wins, we will resolve our issues with Baghdad peacefully.”"
252,"NEW DELHI: Indian soldiers killed a large number of suspected militants in a gunfight along the country's restive border with Myanmar, the army said Wednesday.A statement posted by the army's eastern command on Twitter said its offensive had resulted in ""heavy casualties"" to insurgents on the Indian side of the border.""A column of Indian army, while operating along the Indo-Myanmar border, was fired upon,"" it said.Indian troops fired in retaliation, killing ""a large number"" of militants.

Coli infection.This superbug is known to be resistant to all kinds of antibiotics, even Colistin which is only used by doctors when all else fails.Bugs that can resist the effect of Colistin were first discovered in China and tests showed evidence of their existence in both Europe and Asia. However, doctors have not been able to identify how the bug traveled to the US. The patient hadn’t traveled recently nor is Colistin used frequently by doctors in the US.Doctors fear that a superbug of this kind could lead to “the end of the road” for antibiotics and would also create more infections that can not be treated.Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thoman Frieden expressed his concern regarding the matter, ""The more we look at drug resistance, the more concerned we are,"" the BBC reported.""The medicine cabinet is empty for some patients. It is the end of the road for antibiotics unless we act urgently,” Frieden added.Dr Nasia Safdar, from the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health commented on the reports,""It wouldn't be a stretch to say that we are towards the end of effective antimicrobial therapy for antibiotic resistant bacteria,"" she said, the BBC reported.The World Health Organization deems antibiotic resistance one of the greatest threats to global health and doctors are urging drugmakers to develop drugs against superbugs of this particular kind.  "

Provincial population welfare departments regularly run campaigns to educate citizens on the benefits of various forms of birth control.Advertisements for condoms and other forms of birth control are rare in Pakistan.Contraceptive use in Pakistan is already low and fell by a further 7.2 percent last year, according to government statistics on the country's Couple Years of Protection (CYP), an internationally used metric for contraceptive use.Pakistan is the sixth most populous country in the world, with a population growth rate of 1.92 percent, according to the government. Its population is projected to increase to more than 227 million by 2025.""Reduction in population growth is one of the top priorities of the government of Pakistan to maintain balance between country's resources and population,"" said the government's annual report on contraceptive use.The lack of use of contraceptives may also have implications for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases like HIV/AIDS, which United Nations data show claimed over 2,800 lives in Pakistan last year.Television channels and radio stations that do not comply with the ban will face ""legal action under PEMRA laws"", the statement said, although no specific punishment was mentioned.PEMRA did not respond to a request for comment."

266,"Education authorities in Switzerland ruled on Thursday that students and families who refuse to shake hands with teachers will risk facing a fine of $5000.The issue first came to light when a school in the northern town of Therwil, near Basel allowed two Muslim students an exemption from shaking their female teacher’s hands.Two Muslim brothers aged 14 and 15 pleaded their cases saying that it is against their beliefs to shake hands with a female teacher and that physical contact with the opposite gender is only allowed with family members.The school later decided that the two students would not shake hands with their male teachers either to avoid any discrimination.The incident sparked debate as it is a Swiss tradition for students to shake their teachers’ hands at the beginning and end of the day.The local Education department released a statement on Wednesday stating the exemption was lifted because “the public interest with respect to equality between men and women and the integration of foreigners significantly outweighs the freedom of religion.” They also added that a teacher has the right to demand a handshake.The statement said if the students refuse to shake hands again, ""the sanctions called for by law will be applied.""The ruling received a lot of criticism from The Islamic Central Council of Switzerland the views expressed on their website called the ruling ‘totalitarian’ as its intent is to ""forbid religious people from meeting their obligations to God.""The council also said that it would take legal action if any fines were given out.Around 400,000 Muslims reside in Switzerland and make up 5% of the country’s population of 8 million.""Shaking hands when greeting one another is part of the culture in Switzerland and practiced as such at Therwil schools,"" Therwil's local council said in a statement last month. ""The decision of the school therefore doesn't reflect the position of the community council in this matter.""The ordeal for the two boys did not end with the ruling. Once the issue came to light the family’s application for Swiss citizenship filed in January was also put on hold.

267,"LONDON: The World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday rejected a call for the Rio Olympic Games to be moved or postponed due to the threat posed by large outbreak of Zika virus in Brazil.Responding to a call from more than 100 leading scientists, who said it would be unethical for the Games to go ahead as scheduled, the United Nations health agency said having the Games in Rio as planned would ""not significantly alter"" the spread of Zika, which is linked to serious birth defects.""Based on the current assessment of Zika virus circulating in almost 60 countries globally and 39 in the Americas, there is no public health justification for postponing or cancelling the games,"" the WHO said in a statement.In an public letter posted online on Friday, around 150 leading public health experts, many of them bioethicists, said the risk of infection from the Zika virus is too high for the Games to go ahead safely.The letter was sent to Margaret Chan, the WHO's director-general, and said that the Games, due to be held in Rio de Janeiro in August, should be moved to another location or delayed.""An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,"" the letter said.But the WHO rejected the call, saying Brazil ""is one of almost 60 countries and territories"" where Zika has been detected and that people continued to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons.""The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice,"" it said.The WHO's advice is that pregnant women should not travel to areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission, including Rio de Janeiro. It also advises everyone to make all efforts to protect against mosquito bites and to practice safe sex.Zika infection in pregnant women has been shown to be a cause of the birth defect microcephaly and other serious brain abnormalities in babies.The connection between Zika and microcephaly first came to light last fall in Brazil, which has confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly."
268,"LONDON: Two leading unions of Pakistani journalists in the UK – Pakistan Journalists Association (PJA) and Pakistan Press Club (PPC) – have called on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) leadership in Pakistan to publicly condemn and expel three activists who were involved in attacking a senior Pakistani journalist as well as others during a PTI demonstration outside Hasan Nawaz Sharif’s flat here.Veteran journalist Ahmed Ali Syed, who works for a private television channel from London, was attacked by Tariq Mahmood during the PTI demonstration and extremely vulgar language was used against the journalist as he reported back to his news channel about the estimated number of protestors in the demonstrations.Tariq Mahmood led the attack on Ahmed Ali Syed and later on he was joined by PTI senior PTI activist Faisal Khawaja in congratulating him on abusing the media. But it was Imran Khakwani who started the abusive and threatening language right from the start of the protest.He repeatedly called on this scribe and others to tell him in advance what they will write in their reports about the protest. When told that this is not how journalism is done, he started issuing threats, used threatening language and throughout the protest tried to harass journalists.Senior PTI leader Dr Muhammad Afzal even asked him to leave the protest but Imran Khakwani carried on. Imran Khakwani describes himself as “Chartered accountant, MSC Finance” on his profile. He runs a business called berkeleyaccountants.co.uk. His business address is registered at Berkeley Accountants, Tower Bridge Business Complex, B402 100 Clements Road, London, SE16 4DG.Representatives of both unions gathered in West London and decided that the PTI leadership in Pakistan will be requested to look into the “matter of high concern” and “take a strict public action against the goons involved in openly issuing insults and threats to media workers”.Media representatives said that PTI events in the UK will not be attended unless the party leadership takes a strict action against the three activists and publicly sanctions them for their actions. They said that it was alarming that the trend of attacking media has reached London which is known for democratic and tolerant values.Media workers agreed that attack on Ahmed Ali Syed was not an isolated incident because there was a pattern of violent behaviour against journalists at political events where the leadership simply “distances” itself from the activists blaming others, refusing to take responsibility. They said that eye-witness account and video footage showed that the attackers had support of their colleagues who shouted abuse at media while the protest organisers looked helpless in reigning into them.Journalists resolved that in future intolerant and abusive behaviour of no religious or political party will be tolerated and any group involved in harassment of media workers will be boycotted. Journalists said that it will be responsibility of the event organisers to arrange security of media and in the event of an attack on any journalist – whether verbal or physical - the concerned political party will be held responsible.Those who attended the meeting included senior representatives from PJA and PPC namely Wajahat Ali Khan, Moebeen Chaudhary, Shaukat Dar, Ahmed Ali Syed, Fayaz Ghaffur, Atta-ul-Haq, Nasim Siddiqui, Aamir Ghauri, Ghulam Hussain Awan, Inaam Sehgal, Wadood Mushtaq, Chaudhary Akram, Musarrat Iqbal, Waqar Zaidi and Irfan-ul-Haque.— Originally appeared in The News"
269,"RIYADH: An Iranian delegation has left Saudi Arabia without an agreement for its citizens to attend Hajj this year, Saudi media have reported, a second failure by the rival Middle East powers to strike a deal.Relations between the two countries plummeted after hundreds of Iranians died in a crush during last year’s Hajj and after Riyadh broke diplomatic ties when its Tehran embassy was stormed in January over the Saudi execution of a Shia cleric.The dispute has provided another arena for discord between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which back opposing sides in Syria and other conflicts across the region.“At dawn on Friday, the Iranian mission expressed its desire to leave to home without signing the minutes of arrangements,” the official Saudi Press Agency reported late on Friday.Iran’s top Hajj official Saeed Ohadi said there was still room to find agreement until Sunday night, according to Tehran’s official IRNA news agency.Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the impasse.“We witnessed a lack of seriousness by the Iranian side in dealing with the issue. It is yet another attempt by them to politicise the Hajj,” Abdulmohsen Alyas, an under-secretary at Riyadh’s Information Ministry, said.After an earlier attempt to agree on Hajj terms failed this month, Iran’s leadership blamed Saudi Arabia for the delay, saying it was “very concerned” for the safety of Iranian pilgrims after last year’s disaster.Eight months after the last Hajj, Saudi Arabia has still not published a report into the disaster, at which it said over 700 pilgrims were killed, the highest death toll at the annual pilgrimage since a crush in 1990.However, counts of fatalities in the disaster by countries who received home the bodies of their citizens showed that over 2,000 people may have died in the crush, more than 400 of them Iranians.Adding to Tehran’s anger, King Salman was later quoted in Saudi state media as praising Saudi authorities for a “successful” Hajj.Saudi Arabia’s Hajj ministry said it had met a number of Iran’s concerns, offering electronic visas, a deal on air transport for pilgrims and diplomatic representation by Switzerland for Iranians in Makkah.— File photo by Reuters"
270,"NEW YORK: Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif has said that Pakistan cannot take responsibility for peace and security in Afghanistan, adding that effective border management with Afghanistan is imperative to stop infiltration of terrorists.Speaking at the Asia Society seminar in New York, the minister said that the United States cannot succeed in Afghanistan by waging war. He said that 16 years ongoing war in Afghanistan shows peace can be restored in Afghanistan only through a negotiated settlement.Asif said that no one desires peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan, but that a number of Afghan leaders want to continue status quo for their vested interests.Dismissing accusations of safe havens for terrorists in Pakistan, the minister said it is Afghanistan which harbours these safe havens.The minister blamed India for carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan through Afghanistan, saying that more than 66 terrorist organisations are active inside India.This was originally published in The News"

272,"Neymar has been included in Paris St Germain’s squad for Wednesday’s Champions League game against Bayern Munich after recovering from a foot injury, coach Unai Emery said on Tuesday.The Brazilian’s return fuelled speculation over whether the Brazilian forward or Edinson Cavani would take a penalty if the French club are awarded one during the Group B game at the Parc des Princes.The two players argued in the 2-0 win over Olympique Lyonnais nine days ago when Neymar tried to take a penalty instead of Uruguayan Cavani, who eventually had his spot-kick parried away by the keeper.“Neymar is in the squad to play the game tomorrow,” Emery told a news conference.Neymar, the world’s most expensive footballer, missed PSG’s 0-0 draw at Montpellier on Saturday as the team dropped their first points of the season in Ligue 1.Argentine winger Angel Di Maria also returns to the PSG squad after nearly three weeks out injured.Neymar and Cavani are likely to start alongside Kylian Mbappe in a 4-3-3 formation and Emery said he had discussed the penalty situation with the players.“I spoke with each of them and they know how things will happen,” the Spanish coach said."
273,"MOSCOW: The absence of key midfielders due to injury will have no impact on the Manchester United team’s quality in their Champions League match against CSKA Moscow, manager Jose Mourinho said.United will be without Paul Pogba, Marouane Fellaini and Michael Carrick, leaving Mourinho with Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera as the only experienced central midfielders available for the game on Wednesday.“We don’t have Fellaini, we don’t have Pogba, we don’t have Carrick. So all three midfield players we lose for this match. The solutions are not many,” Mourinho told a news conference on Tuesday.“We try not to focus on individual battles or specific areas on the pitch. We try to focus on the bigger picture. And we are going to have a team with quality, with balance.”Mourinho expects Fellaini to be back soon after sustaining an ankle injury in the 1-0 win at Southampton on Saturday.“It was only when I saw it on TV that I realised that Fellaini was very lucky,” Mourinho added. “I do not expect him to be out for long.”CSKA Moscow lie fourth in the Russian Premier League with six wins from 11 games but Mourinho believes they are “the best CSKA I am going to play against”.“I don’t like to speak about opponents,” he said.“If I speak good, I motivate them. If I speak bad, I motivate them.”CSKA manager Viktor Goncharenko said his squad would try to find United’s weak spots.“These are such great clubs that if they lose top players they always replace them,” Goncharenko said.“It doesn’t mean that the level will decrease. We won’t find any weakness here.”United, unbeaten this season and level on points with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League, started their Champions League campaign with a 3-0 win over Basel at Old Trafford.CSKA beat Benfica 2-1 in Lisbon in their opening match."
274,"US President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused North Korea of brutally abusing an American student who had been held captive in North Korea, saying the young man had been ""tortured beyond belief.""Otto Warmbier, 22, died in June a few days after he was sent home in a mysterious coma after more than a year in prison in North Korea.Trump had previously blamed Pyongyang's ""brutal regime"" for Warmbier's plight but it was the first time the president publicly accused North Korea of torture in the case.US officials have said Trump was personally taken aback by Warmbier's death and his comment Tuesday ratchets up the pressure on Kim Jong-Un's regime.Warmbier had been convicted of offences against the state for trying to steal a propaganda poster from a Pyongyang hotel and sentenced to 15 years' hard labour.""Otto was tortured beyond belief by North Korea,"" Trump said on Twitter.His post followed the airing of an interview with Warmbier's parents.""They kidnapped Otto, they tortured him, they intentionally injured him. They are not victims, they are terrorists,"" Fred Warmbier said Tuesday on ""Fox and Friends.""The father had previously criticized former president Barack Obama's administration for how little it did for their son, saying officials had counselled the family against speaking out to avoid antagonizing the North Korean regime.Three Americans accused of various crimes against the state are behind bars in the North, which is engaged in a tense standoff with the Trump administration over its banned missile and nuclear weapons programs."
275,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron offered an ambitious vision for European renewal on Tuesday, calling for the EU to work more closely on defense and immigration and for the euro zone to have its own budget, ideas he may struggle to implement.In a nearly two-hour speech delivered two days after the German election in which Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU/CSU bloc scored its worst result since 1949, limiting her freedom to maneuver on Europe, the 39-year-old French president held little back in terms of sweep, self-assurance and aspiration.But at a time when Europe is beset by tensions between east and west and battling to overcome nearly a decade of draining economic crisis, Macron’s earnest and at times high-brow discourse ran the risk of falling on deaf ears.Speaking at the Sorbonne, he portrayed Europe as needing to relaunch itself, saying that on issues as diverse as asylum, border protection, corporate tax, intelligence sharing, defense and financial stability it needed much deeper cooperation.“The only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic,” the former investment banker and philosophy student said, flanked by a French and a European Union flag.“At the beginning of the next decade, Europe must have a joint intervention force, a common defense budget and a joint doctrine for action.”In his run for the presidency, Macron made European reform a central plank of his centrist campaign, and he and Merkel have spoken frequently about their desire for France and Germany, the European Union’s two largest economies and often its engines of change, to take the lead on integration.But five months into his five-year term, Macron faces the threat that Merkel, 63 and looking to start her fourth term, has less capacity to move than either would have hoped.Her alliance is still the largest bloc in the Bundestag, but to build a working majority she will likely have to form a coalition with the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), who are opposed to many of Macron’s ideas.German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), hailed Macron’s speech “a passionate plea against nationalism and for Europe”.“He can count on us,” said Gabriel, whose party has ruled out being part of a new grand coalition.Rather than tailoring his speech to fit the contours of what the FDP, the Greens or Merkel may have wanted to hear, Macron kept his vision broad and far-reaching, while also detailing some specific ideas for an improved euro zone.“A budget can only go hand-in-hand with strong political leadership led by a common (finance) minister and a strong parliamentary supervision at the European level,” he said, emphasising the need for democratic accountability.The fiscally conservative FDP dislikes the idea of a euro zone budget or any facility that may lead to financial transfers from wealthier euro zone countries to poorer ones, as well as the possibility of national debt being pooled.The party has also called for phasing out Europe’s ESM bailout fund, which Macron wants to turn into a European Monetary Fund, and wants to see changes to EU treaties that would allow countries to leave the euro zone.“You don’t strengthen Europe with new pots of money,” Alexander Lambsdorff, an FDP member in the European Parliament, said on Twitter in reaction to Macron’s speech.In a statement issued by the FDP in Berlin, Lambsdorff said: “The problem in Europe is not a lack of public funds, but the lack of reform. A euro zone budget would set exactly the wrong incentives.”Not shying away from addressing Germany directly even as it tries to resolve the fallout from Sunday’s election, Macron set an objective that the two countries completely integrate their markets and corporate rules by 2024.“We share the same European ambitions and I know her commitment to Europe,” he said of Merkel. “I‘m proposing to Germany a new partnership. We will not agree on everything, not immediately, but we will discuss everything.”In Berlin on Monday, Merkel said it was important to move beyond catchphrases and provide detail on how Europe could be improved. It was not immediately clear whether Macron had managed to go beyond slogans as far as Merkel was concerned.But Martin Selmayr, the chief of staff of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, said the proposals to reinforce the euro zone would be discussed alongside Juncker’s own at a euro zone summit planned for December.Italy’s EU affairs minister, Sandro Gozi, said the speech would inspire European leaders into action.“An excellent speech by Emmanuel Macron on reviving the European Union. Let’s work on this together, starting tomorrow at the Lyon Summit,” he said, referring to a meeting of the Italian and French leaders to discuss industrial policy.Macron said he hoped his ideas would be taken into account in Germany’s coalition building negotiations. Those talks are not expected to begin until mid-October and may take several months.“Some had said I should wait for the coalition talks to be concluded,” Macron said, adding had he done so, the reaction in Berlin would have been: “Your proposals are great but it’s too late, the coalition deal already lays out what will we do on Europe for the next four years.”"
276,"KARACHI: A fire broke out in a garment factory near New Karachi, late on Tuesday night.According to details, fire that started on the ground floor engulfed the entire factory building.Eight fire tenders along with two water bowsers were deployed to help extinguish the fire.According to Chief Fire Officer, the fire has been contained and the fire department is now busy with the cooling operation. This is the third fire that broke out in the span of two consecutive days.Earlier this week, it took over eleven hours for firefighters to extinguish a fire that engulfed a cardboard factory in North Karachi during the wee hours of Monday.Exceeding ten hours, firefighters were still unable to douse the fire that erupted near Shafeeq Morh area of North Karachi.Up to nine fire tenders were deployed on the site, along with two snorkels and two water bowsers, in efforts to gain control and stop the fire from spreading further.According to Mayor Karachi Waseem Akhtar, who was present on location, firefighters faced extreme difficulty due to the unavailability of proper equipment.The Mayor complained about lack of resources at the disposal of the fire department to efficiently deal with such incidents.Earlier the same day, another fire erupted at a restaurant situated on the ground floor of a commercial building in Karachi’s Boat Basin area.Five fire brigade vehicles and one snorkel were used to extinguish the fire at the building's first floor after having doused the flames at the ground floor.The windows of the commercial building, spread over three floors, shattered due to the intensity of the fire.Sources said short-circuiting could be behind the fire.Rescue officials said the gas cylinders and plastic furniture of the restaurant aided the spread of the fire.No loss of life or injuries were reported in the incident.Once the fire was completely extinguished, fire brigade officials said eight vehicles were used to douse the blaze."
277,"Nike Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the world’s largest footwear maker benefited from strong demand in China, its third-biggest market, and cost cuts.Nike, which has celebrity endorsements from NBA players such as LeBron James and Kevin Durant, has also been quick to expand its direct-to-consumer presence by testing a pilot program with Amazon and Facebook’s Instagram, and sprucing up its revenue from China through revamped stores and increased online efforts with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s Tmall.The company’s sales in China rose 9 percent in the first quarter ended Aug. 31.Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike in June said it would cut 2 percent of its global workforce and cut about a quarter of its shoe styles in a bid to become nimbler in the face of intensifying competition from Germany-based Adidas AG and Puma SE.Nike’s selling, general and administrative expenses fell 1 percent to $2.9 billion (2.16 billion pounds) in the first quarter.The company’s net income fell to $950 million, or 57 cents per share, in the quarter, from $1.25 billion, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain items, Nike earned 57 cents per share, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of 48 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose marginally to $9.07 billion, but missed the average analyst estimate of $9.08 billion.Shares of the Dow component were flat at $53.65 in after-market trading on Tuesday."
278,"RIYADH/WASHINGTON: Saudi King Salman on Tuesday ordered that women be allowed to drive cars, state media said, ending the conservative Islamic kingdom's status as the only country where that is forbidden.Saudi Arabia has been widely criticised for being the only country in the world that bans women from driving, despite gradual improvement on some women’s issues in recent years and ambitious government targets to increase their public role, especially in the workforce.The royal decree ordered the formation of a ministerial body to give advice within 30 days and then implement the order by June 24, 2018, according to state news agency SPA.It stipulated that the move must “apply and adhere to the necessary Sharia standards”, referring to Islamic law. It gave no details but said a majority of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars, Saudi Arabia’s top clerical body, had approved its permissibility.An hour after the official announcement in Saudi Arabia, a jubilant Saudi ambassador to Washington, Prince Khaled bin Salman, said it was “an historic and big day in our kingdom”.“I think our leadership understands that our society is ready. I think it’s the right decision at the right time,” the ambassador said.Positive reactions quickly poured in from inside the kingdom and around the world.The US State Department welcomed the move as “a great step in the right direction”. President Donald Trump commended the decision, the White House said in a separate statement that pledged US support for a plan the Kingdom announced last year for economic and social reforms.“This is a positive step toward promoting the rights and opportunities of women in Saudi Arabia,” the White House statement said. “We will continue to support Saudi Arabia in its to efforts to strengthen Saudi society and the economy through reforms like this and the implementation of Saudi Vision 2030.”For more than 25 years, women activists have campaigned to be allowed to drive, defiantly taking to the road, petitioning the king and posting videos of themselves behind the wheel on social media. The protests brought them arrest and harassment.Activist Manal al-Sherif, who was arrested in 2011 after a driving protest, took to Twitter following the king’s announcement to express her relief. “Today, the last country on earth to allow women to drive... we did it”, she wrote.Latifa al-Shaalan, a member of the Shura Council, an advisory body, said the decision would strengthen women’s employment in the private sector.“This is an historic day and I cannot find the words to express my feelings and the feelings of thousands of Saudi women,” she said on Arabiya TV.In Saudi Arabia, a top Arab ally of the United States, women are legally subject to a male guardian, who must give approval to basic decisions they make in fields including education, employment, marriage, travel plans and even medical treatment.Women in the kingdom are also bound by law to wear long robes and a headscarf and require the consent of a male guardianfor most legal actions.Prince Khaled, the ambassador, said women would not need permission from their guardians to get a license or have a guardian in the car and would be allowed to drive anywhere in the kingdom, including the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina.Women with a license from any of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries would be allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia, he added. He said the Interior Ministry would have to decide whether they could be professional drivers.“In terms of international PR, this is the biggest overnight win that Saudi Arabia - and particularly MBS - could possibly have,” said Jane Kinninmont, senior research fellow at Chatham House.The position of Saudi women gradually improved under late King Abdullah and since King Salman took over in 2015, the kingdom has been opening more areas for women through the government’s modernizing reforms.Asked whether he was worried about a conservative backlash, the ambassador said: “On these changes some people will be in the drivers’ seat... some people will be in the back seat, but we’re all going to move forward.”He added: “It’s not women must drive, it’s women can drive. So if any women do not want to drive in Saudi Arabia, that’s her choice.”The decision could also have broad economic impacts, making it possible for women to get to work without a driver but also curbing the popularity of car hailing apps like Uber and Careem.Prince Khaled, a son of the king, said the decision was as much about economic reform as social change.His older brother, 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed, has become the face of reform in the kingdom in the past few years.Many younger Saudis regard his ascent as evidence that their generation is taking a central place in running a country whose patriarchal traditions have for decades made power the province of the old and blocked women’s progress.“Oh my God, this is amazing. Ever since Mohammed bin Salman’s rise, he has fast-tracked all the changes that are needed for our country,” said Marwa Afandi, a 35-year-old event planner in the Red Sea city of Jeddah.“Congratulations to all my ladies, this is a real victory.”"
279,"LONDON: Diego Costa’s return to La Liga side Atletico Madrid from Jan. 1 2018 has been finalised, Premier League champions Chelsea said in a statement on Tuesday.The two clubs agreed the transfer last week and on Monday the 28-year-old Spain forward passed a medical to return to the Spanish capital.“Diego Costa has today agreed terms for his transfer to Atletico Madrid, which will take effect on 1 January 2018,” Chelsea said in a statement.“We thank Diego for his efforts and wish him well in his future career.”The controversial Spaniard’s departure from Stamford Bridge signalled the end of a messy transfer saga during which Costa claimed Chelsea manager Antonio Conte had told him via text that he was no longer required at the club.His last game for Chelsea came at Wembley in May when he scored in the 2-1 FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal.Costa leaves Chelsea having won two Premier League titles, one League Cup and scored 59 goals in 120 appearances -- finishing as Chelsea’s top scorer in each of his three seasons in west London.“I‘m very happy to return home,” Costa said in a statement on Atletico’s official website.”I’ve always said it, Atletico is my home. I‘m very, very happy. I‘m looking forward to start contributing. I‘m going to give my all for the team, as I always try to do.“Thank you to the whole club for making this move forward, I‘m very grateful to everyone.”Costa will have to wait before pulling on the red and white striped shirt of Atletico as the European transfer window is closed and Atletico are banned from registering new players until 2018 after breaching FIFA rules.Costa, who will wear the number 18 shirt, will join the team’s training from Wednesday and will be eligible for selection from Jan. 2 when the Spanish transfer window opens and Atletico’s ban ends.Costa first joined Atletico in 2006 and following a string of loan spells established himself as a key part of Diego Simeone’s title-winning side in 2013-14 before joining Chelsea in a deal worth 32 million pounds ($43.21 million).Atletico are in the same Champions League group as Chelsea but their two clashes will both be before Costa is eligible to continue his career with the Spanish club."
280,"SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter announced a test project, on Tuesday, allowing tweets to be expanded to 280 characters - double the existing limit - in the latest effort to boost flagging growth at the social network.San Francisco-based Twitter said the new limit, a major shift for the messaging platform known for its 140-character tweets, aims to address ""a major cause of frustration"" for many users.Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey fired off what may be one of the first expanded tweets.""This is a small change, but a big move for us,"" he wrote. ""140 was an arbitrary choice... Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet.""A ""small group"" of users will see the new limits before Twitter decides on rolling out the changes more broadly, the company said.""Trying to cram your thoughts into a tweet - we've all been there, and it's a pain,"" product manager Aliza Rosen and software engineer Ikuhiro Ihara said in a blog post.""We're doing something new: we're going to try out a longer limit, 280 characters, in languages impacted by cramming.""Twitter planned to leave the old limit in place for tweets in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean because internal data showed written characters in those languages packed plenty into the allotted space.""Our research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people tweeting in English, but it is not for those tweeting in Japanese,"" Rosen and Ihara said.""Also, in all markets, when people don't have to cram their thoughts into 140 characters and actually have some to spare, we see more people tweeting.""Twitter, which became a public company in 2013, has never reported a profit even though it has built a loyal base of celebrities, journalists and political figures, including prolific tweeter US President Donald Trump.In its most recent quarter, Twitter reported its base of monthly active users was unchanged at 328 million compared to the first three months of the year and up just 5 percent from a year earlier.Its growth has failed to keep pace with the social network leader Facebook, which has some two billion users, and Facebook-owned Instagram, with 800 million.""We're hoping fewer tweets run into the character limit, which should make it easier for everyone to tweet,"" Rosen and Ihara said in the blog post.""We understand since many of you have been Tweeting for years, there may be an emotional attachment to 140 characters... But we tried this, saw the power of what it will do, and fell in love with this new, still brief, constraint.""Twitter has been seeking to draw in users by offering more video including live streaming of sporting events, aiming to broaden its appeal.The messaging platform reported a net loss of US$116 million (S$157 million) in the second quarter, slightly wider than its US$107 million loss a year ago.It remained an open question whether the new tweet limit would ignite the growth an engagement Twitter needs to compete in the fast-moving social media segment.""The more they expand, the more they start looking like Facebook,"" Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle said of Twitter.""And if they start looking like Facebook, then Facebook will take them out and has the war chest for it.""The move by Twitter could also be rendered moot by lifestyle changes brought about by trends in voice-commanded digital assistants and looking at the world through mixed-reality glasses, said Gartner analyst Brian Blau.""What are tweets in those worlds?"" Blau said. ""We see Twitter sort of struggling to get this business right while everyone else is moving in another direction."""
281,"SYDNEY: Australia on Monday committed to creating a national space agency as it looks to cash in on the lucrative $420 billion and fast-evolving astronautical sector.The announcement came at a week-long Adelaide space conference attended by the world´s top scientists and experts including SpaceX chief Elon Musk.It brings Canberra -- which already has significant involvement in national and international space activities -- into line with most other developed nations, which already have dedicated agencies to help coordinate the industry and shape development.""The global space industry is growing rapidly and it´s crucial that Australia is part of this growth,"" acting science minister Michaelia Cash said in statement.""A national space agency will ensure we have a strategic long-term plan that supports the development and application of space technologies and grows our domestic space industry.""According to the government, the global space sector -- encompassing innovation, defence, and telecommunications -- has been growing annually since the late 1990s at almost 10 percent, driving revenue each year of US$323 billion.Thousands of the world´s top scientists and space experts are attending the week-long International Astronautical Congress in Adelaide.SpaceX chief Musk is set to give an update on his ambitious vision of establishing a Mars colony.Also among those presenting is defence giant Lockheed Martin, which is working with NASA on plans to reach the Red Planet.Lee Spitler, from Macquarie University´s astronomy department in Sydney, said Australia´s space industry currently operated ""as a grassroots movement across a small number of companies, university groups and the defence sector"".""It will help bring to the forefront all the great work that has been going on in Australia in the space sector, and increase the potential for our country to play a key role in the international space scene in the future,"" said Spitler.Australia´s commitment to an agency follows the government in July ordering a review of the country´s space industry capability, with a fuller strategy to underpin the work of the new body to be unveiled next year.This year marks the 50th anniversary of Australia launching its first satellite, the only country at the time to achieve the feat after the United States and Russia.It has played a vital part in many space missions in the decades since then, with its Deep Space Communication Complex outside Canberra one of only three sites in the world capable of tracking NASA´s deep space assets.Australian National University´s Penny King, who worked on the Mars ""Curiosity Rover"", mission, said the agency would improve opportunities for local scientists.""Australians will be on the world stage, asking questions such as: How can we best care for Earth?

282,"DORTMUND: Cristiano Ronaldo scored twice in his 150th European appearance to give Real Madrid a 3-1 victory at Borussia Dortmund, their first against them in Germany, and make it two wins out of two matches in their Champions League Group H.Ronaldo, who has now scored 411 goals in his 400 Real appearances, grabbed their second of the evening after a fine effort from Welshman Gareth Bale, who had put them ahead with a superb volley in the 18th minute.The Spaniards punished the hosts for playing too high and found the gaps they needed to score. The Portuguese killed off the match, thumping the ball past keeper Roman Buerki in the 79th.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang briefly pulled one back in the 54th but the Germans could not replicate last season’s two-goal comeback to draw.Real, whose lacklustre start in La Liga has left them in sixth place seven points off leaders Barcelona, have six points, level with Tottenham Hotspur who beat APOEL Nicosia 3-0.

We want to rediscover our best and I think tonight was a step in the right direction.”It was always expected to be a rollercoaster game and the two sides did not disappoint, shooting instantly out of the blocks.Dortmund’s Jeremy Toljan sprinted clear but his pinpoint cutback was cleared at the last moment with Aubameyang lurking at the far post after three minutes.Daniel Carvajal responded with a fine solo effort and Ronaldo also came close a little later but the Spaniards were lucky not to concede a penalty when Ramos cleared a Maximilian Philipp effort on the line with his hand.But there was no luck involved when Bale raced into space and perfectly volleyed in a smooth Carvajal cross in the 18th to shock the home crowd.Dortmund did not back down though and Raphael Varane had to come to the rescue right after the restart, clearing an Andriy Yarmolenko cross on the goal line.cross on the goal line.“We had our chances but Real did it really well,” said Dortmund’s Gonzalo Castro. “With players like Bale and Ronaldo, they really know how to take advantage of the gaps. It is too dangerous against such teams to stand too high up the pitch.”It was Real who scored again when Bale was given far too much space to cut in and find Ronaldo in the heart of the box in the 50th.The Germans quickly pulled a goal back with Aubameyang stabbing in a Castro cross to keep the game tight, until Ronaldo broke clear and fired in their third goal and their 14th in the last seven Champions League matches."
283,"NEW YORK: Oil prices ended 1 percent lower on Tuesday after investors took profits following a rally to 26-month highs spurred largely by threats from Turkey to cut crude exports from Iraq’s Kurdistan region.The market was also under pressure ahead of weekly US oil inventory data that was expected to show a fourth straight week of crude builds.Brent LCOc1 settled 58 cents, or 1 percent, lower at $58.44 a barrel after hitting $59.49, its highest since July 2015 and more than 34 percent above their 2017 low.US crude futures CLc1 closed 34 cents, or 0.7 percent, lower at $51.88 a barrel, after hitting a five-month high of $52.43.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan repeated a threat to cut off the pipeline that carries 500,000-600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, intensifying pressure on the Kurdish autonomous region over its independence referendum.This potential loss, combined with 1.8 million bpd of output reductions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers, raised concerns of tighter supply.The Iraqi government said it will not hold talks with the Kurdistan Regional Government about the results of the referendum, which is expected to show a comfortable majority in favour of independence after the results are announced later this week.The rally led to profit-taking.“The market was approaching if not in overbought territory,” Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Americas.And other analysts were skeptical about further price gains due to increased refining and higher crude output from the United States.“The refined products led the way up the past few weeks,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC. “Now that we see refineries coming back online that should take the scarcity premium out of the market, refined prices will fall, and that will bring oil down with it.”US refinery utilization was expected to rise 3.6 percentage points from 83.2 percent of total capacity in the week ended Sept. 15, according to a Reuters poll on Tuesday.Oil prices pared losses in post-settlement trade after industry group the American Petroleum Institute reported that US crude stocks fell last week as refineries boosted output, while gasoline inventories increased and distillate stocks fell.On Wednedsay the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) releases its data.US crude supplies have been rising as imports and production recover in the aftermath of Harvey, while refineries have been slower to restart.The EIA said last week that US crude stocks jumped 4.6 million barrels as imports increased by 734,000 bpd and production rose 157,000 bpd to 9.51 million bpd, close to levels before Harvey hit Texas on Aug. 25.“The all-time record (for domestic production) is 9.61 million June 2015, last week’s report was 100,000 barrels off of that,” said Yawger, “With that in mind no one wants to ride that long position into the EIA report.”"

285,"Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that she would talk with all mainstream parties about trying to form a ""good, stable"" government after Germany's watershed election, and vowed to try to win back voters who supported an upstart nationalist force.Sunday's election saw the rightwing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party poach one million votes from Merkel's conservatives, leaving her without an obvious coalition to lead Europe's largest economy.""We had hoped for a better result,"" she admitted, referring to her CDU/CSU bloc's score of 33 percent, its worst outcome since 1949.Merkel, 63, said she would now seek exploratory talks on an alliance with two smaller parties, the pro-business Free Democrats and the ecologist Greens.And she said she would extend an olive branch to the Social Democrats, her junior partners for eight of her 12 years in power, who suffered a crushing setback with just 20.5 percent share of the vote and pledged to go into opposition.The vote marked a breakthrough for the anti-Islam AfD, which with 12.6 percent became the third-strongest party, and it vowed to ""go after"" Merkel over her migrant and refugee policy.Merkel herself acknowledged that she had been a ""polarising figure"" to many people who ultimately gave their vote to the AfD, noting that voters in the AfD's strongholds in depressed corners of the ex-communist east felt ""left behind"".She said she believed that not all were diehard supporters of the AfD and that at least some could be won back ""with good policies that solve problems"".News weekly Der Spiegel said Merkel had no one but herself to blame for her election bruising.""Angela Merkel deserved this defeat,"" the magazine's Dirk Kurbjuweit wrote, accusing her of running an ""uninspired"" campaign and ""largely ignoring the challenges posed by the right"".The entry of around 90 hard-right MPs to the glass-domed Bundestag chamber breaks a taboo in post-World War II Germany.While joyful supporters of the AfD -- a party with links to the far-right French National Front and Britain's UKIP -- sang the German national anthem at a Berlin club as the results came in late Sunday, hundreds of protesters outside shouted ""Nazis out!""shouted ""Nazis out!""The AfD's top candidate in the election, Alexander Gauland, told reporters Monday that the party was the one true defender of a Germany for the Germans.""I don't want to lose Germany to an invasion of foreigners from foreign cultures,"" he said.He refused to back away from recent comments urging Germans to be proud of their war veterans, and calling for a government official who is of Turkish origin to be ""dumped in Anatolia"".But just hours after its triumph, the party's long-simmering infighting between radical and more moderate forces spilled out into the open at a dramatic news conference.spilled out into the open at a dramatic news conference.The AfD co-leader Frauke Petry stunned her colleagues by saying she would not join the party's parliamentary group and would serve as an independent MP. Another leading figure in the party, Alice Weidel, accused Petry of ""irresponsibility"" and urged her to quit.Political scientist Suzanne Schuettemeyer of Halle University in eastern Germany said the AfD's presence in parliament would harm the country's image abroad.""It's Germany and it will change the way we are perceived, because AfD will speak a language that we thought... was outside of our political consensus,"" she told AFP.All other political parties have ruled out working with the AfD, whose leaders call Merkel a ""traitor"" for allowing in more than one million asylum seekers since 2015.Merkel said that while she was not seeking a repeat of the influx, she stood by her decision made on ""humanitarian"" grounds.But the leader of her Bavarian CSU allies, Horst Seehofer, a vocal critic of Merkel's asylum policy, called the vote outcome a ""bitter disappointment"" and pledged to close the ""open flank"" on the right before state elections next year.The Social Democrats' leader Martin Schulz, putting a brave face on his defeat, said the 150-year-old party, traditionally the voice of the working classes, would be ""a strong opposition force in this country, to defend democracy in this country against those who question it and attack it"".This will probably force Merkel to team up with two smaller, and very different, parties to form a lineup dubbed the ""Jamaica coalition"" because the three parties' colours match those of the Caribbean country's flag.One is the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which with 10.7 percent made a comeback after crashing out of parliament four years ago.The other is the left-leaning Greens party, which won 8.9 percent on campaign pledges to drive forward the country's clean-energy transition.But with marked differences on issues ranging from EU integration to immigration, months of horse-trading could lie ahead to build a new government and avert snap elections.European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker urged Merkel to form a stable government as soon as possible.""Europe needs a strong German government now more than ever, one able to actively shape the future of our continent,"" he said."
286,"NICOSIA: A Harry Kane hat-trick saw Spurs notch their second win in as many games in Group H of the Champions League, beating Cypriot champions APOEL Nicosia 3-0 in Cyprus on Tuesday.With the Premier League side missing the creative spark of both Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli, it was down to the English striker to pick up the slack, and despite a spirited effort from the home side, Spurs ran out easy winners.Apoel started shakily and could have been behind on more than one occasion, Heung-Min Son missing the best chance for Spurs when he headed over unmarked from five yards out.The Cypriots slowly grew into the game, striking the bar and coming inches from opening the scoring themselves, following a calamitous clearance from Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris just after the half-hour mark.But it was Spurs who went ahead in the 38th minute when Kane finished coolly after he was left unmarked, 18 yards out. He was expertly found by Toby Alderweireld, placing the ball past the on-rushing Boy Waterman, despite appeals for offside from the home side.Lloris was forced into his first meaningful save in the 47th minute when he was equal to Hungarian forward Roland Sallai’s volley from just inside the penalty area.The French number one was tested again shortly after, this time by the lively Stathis Aloneftis, who was put through by Nuno Morais down the left. His high shot was tipped over by Lloris.Spurs doubled their lead and Kane got his second in the 62nd minute when Moussa Sissoko found the forward on the edge of the box and the Englishman made no mistake with his right foot.Kane completed his ‘perfect’ hat-trick five minutes later by heading in a Kieran Trippier cross from the right to seal the win for Spurs.Tottenham now have six points, along with Real Madrid who beat Borussia Dortmund 3-1 in Germany. Both APOEL and Dortmund remain without any points."
287,"ARBIL: Iraq's Kurds were Tuesday expecting the announcement of a big ""yes"" vote for independence, as authorities in Baghdad weighed how to respond to a referendum they considered illegal.Large numbers turned out in northern Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region for Monday's vote, which went ahead despite fierce objections from Baghdad, Turkey and Iran.Votes were still being counted on Tuesday, with results expected by the end of the day and no doubt of an overwhelming outcome in favour of independence.The vote is non-binding and will not lead automatically to independence, but is seen by the Kurds as a major step towards a long-cherished dream of statehood.In the regional capital Arbil, a night of fireworks, flag-waving and dancing in the streets followed the vote.""We made a Kurdish state today,"" Arbil resident Ahmad told AFP during the celebrations.""We're Kurdish people, we´re not Arab, we're not Persian, we're no one else... We're Kurds and we'll remain Kurds forever.""The referendum took place peacefully but has increased tensions between the Iraqi Kurds and their neighbours, raising fears of potential unrest.Iraq Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared before the vote that he would take ""necessary measures"" to protect the country´s unity and he was due to meet parliament members on Wednesday.Iraqi lawmakers voted on Tuesday to send troops to disputed areas where the referendum took place, but there have been no signs of a deployment so far.Analysts say Baghdad is deeply concerned by the vote but unlikely to seek a confrontation with the Kurds for now, especially as Iraqi forces continue to battle the Daesh group in its final bastions.Turkey, concerned the vote will stoke the separatist ambitions of its own sizeable Kurdish population, repeatedly condemned the vote as wrong-headed and dangerous.On Tuesday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the Iraqi Kurds and their long-time leader Massud Barzani risked sparking an ""ethnic war"".""If Barzani and the Kurdistan Regional Government do not go back on this mistake as soon as possible, they will go down in history with the shame of having dragged the region into an ethnic and sectarian war,"" Erdogan said in a televised speech.Erdogan warned on polling day that Turkey would shut its border with Iraqi Kurdistan and threatened to block key exports that flow from the region through Turkish territory.He even suggested the possibility of a cross-border incursion similar to the one Turkish forces have carried out against IS and Kurdish fighters in Syria.Iraqi soldiers were seen on Tuesday taking part in a Turkish military drill launched last week in the southern province of Sirnak close to the Iraqi border.An AFP photographer saw soldiers holding Turkish and Iraqi flags while on the move and on tanks during the exercise in the Silopi district.Monday's vote took place across the three northern provinces of autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan - Arbil, Sulaimaniyah and Dohuk - as well as in disputed border zones such as the oil-rich province of Kirkuk.A curfew was lifted early Tuesday on parts of the city of Kirkuk, where it had been imposed on the city centre and non-Kurdish neighbourhoods over fears of unrest connected with the vote.Officials reported that turnout for the referendum stood at 72 per cent, with 3.3 million of the 4.58 million registered voters taking part.Participation was lower in some parts of the region and was at only 50 percent in Sulaimaniyah province, the home base of political forces opposed to Barzani.Barzani´s opponents have accused the longtime regional chief of seeking to empower himself through the vote and said he should have accepted a UN-backed plan to put off the referendum in favour of negotiations with Baghdad.The United Nations and United States urged Barzani to cancel or postpone the vote, with Washington especially concerned it could hamper the fight against Daesh in which Kurdish peshmerga forces have been vital.Issam al-Fayli, a political science professor at Baghdad University, said he did not expect any immediate confrontations.""The Iraqi government will take its time to make decisions, taking special account of the opinions of military leaders because the current priority for Iraq is the war against Daesh,"" he said, using an Arabic name for Daesh.""There will be some minor incidents but the crisis should, in the end, remain under control.""Iran, which like Turkey has a large and restless Kurdish population, also opposed the referendum.Ali Akbar Velayati, chief foreign policy adviser to Iran´s supreme leader, said after the vote that it would sow ""political chaos in the region"".""The honourable people of Kurdistan will not bear this disgrace,"" he said, according to the semi-official ISNA news agency.Left without a state of their own when the borders of the Middle East were redrawn after World War I, the Kurds see themselves as the world´s largest stateless people.The non-Arab ethnic group number between 25 and 35 million people spread across Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria."

Does that seem right to anyone, who has ever met...As per Asiya's petition, she could not get her identity card made as National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) required her to put her father's details. The petitioner stated she wanted to put her guardian's (guru) name instead. Subsequently, NADRA presented the case in the court and also submitted Asiya's identity card with her guru's details on it.Resultantly, the high court allowed transgender persons to put their guru's details on the relevant forms. The decision sent a wave of excitement among the transgender community, the members of which said they were pleased over now being able to vote as well. "

""If we do not conserve our plant diversity, humanity will struggle to solve the global challenges of food and fuel security, environmental degradation, and climate change,"" he said.In all, the botanic gardens surveyed held more than 105,000 species. ""These numbers are all the more remarkable as they represent a minimum estimate, based on data derived from just one-third of botanic gardens worldwide,"" the researchers wrote in the journal Nature Plants.Currently, about 10 percent of the storage capacity of botanic gardens is devoted to endangered species, and this needs to be expanded, they said.Better international coordination is needed to house more species at risk - particularly those from tropical climates, the researchers said.Most of the world's plants are tropical, and they make up 25 percent of plants in botanic gardens, a large number of which are based in the more temperate climates of Europe and North America.Substantial investment is needed to build a global system for the conservation of threatened plants that can prevent species extinctions, the researchers wrote."

296,"DOHA: A Nepalese construction worker in Qatar was ""sacked"" the day after speaking to a UN delegation visiting the 2022 World Cup host country to examine labour conditions, sources told AFP.The incident is considered serious enough that the UN´s International Labour Organization (ILO) said it would be on the agenda when its governing body meets in two months to discuss an investigation into allegations of forced labour by Qatar.""The ILO has been following closely this case and continues to do so with a view to ensuring that the rights of this Nepalese worker are fully respected and protected,"" Corinne Vargha, director of the ILO´s international labour standards department, told AFP in a statement.The case was raised in a previous meeting of the ILO governing body in March 2017, Vargha said, in the context of a complaint against Doha for non-compliance with two ratified ILO international conventions -- namely the Forced Labour Convention and the Labour Inspection Convention.""The complaint will be further discussed by the Governing Body at its November 2017 session,"" she added.That meeting could see the ILO launch a formal investigation into Qatar over its treatment of migrant workers.The construction worker´s plight has also been confirmed by two separate unions.The incident occurred in March 2016, but could only now be reported because of sensitivities surrounding the case.It happened when a six-strong team from the ILO visited a Qatar labour camp.As well as losing his job after telling the UN body about unpaid wages and employers illegally holding his passport, the labourer was also handed a one-way ticket home to Nepal by bosses, unions said.Officials at the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) say the timing of the dismissal ""indicates it was a retaliatory act by his employer"".""This is a violation under international labour standards and contradicts the commitments Qatar has repeatedly made before the ILO,"" said ITUC head Sharan Burrow.The union said the 29-year-old worker never left Qatar, but was subsequently jailed for two weeks due to losing his work sponsor and faced a fine of 4,600 Qatari riyals ($1,240).Under the ""kafala"" system, the prevailing law at the time of the incident, all foreign workers in Qatar required a local sponsor in order to work and maintain residency.That sponsor, whether an individual or company, must grant permission for the labourer to switch jobs or leave the country.The Nepalese national was not working on a World Cup project.The man´s case was cleared earlier this year and he opted to stay in Qatar, working for a new employer and earning around 1,600 Qatari riyals ($430) per month.In response, Qatar´s labour ministry told AFP it was aware of the case and all issues had been resolved.It insisted the case began when the worker left his job in violation of Qatar´s residency and employment laws.""The worker has been granted legal status in Qatar and all financial disputes have been settled with his previous employer.""The Government can confirm that it has been in contact with the ILO about the resolution of this case,"" a ministry statement said.In recent years Doha says it has made great strides in labour relations, including reforms to ensure wages are paid promptly, improved accommodation and the abolition of kafala for a contract-based system.Migrant workers´ expert Nicholas McGeehan said the case demonstrated there remained real problems in Qatar´s treatment of labourers.""The reality is that Qatar´s reforms have been cosmetic and aimed not at improving the situation but rather at presenting a sense of progress."" "
297,"PARIS: An urban agriculture initiative to make Paris more environmentally sustainable, mainly through farming on the capital’s rooftops, has been such a success that the mayor is unveiling a new round of projects this week.Rooftop farming has boomed in the past years from New York to Tokyo via London and Paris.By 2020, the French capital will host more than 100 hectares (0.39 square mile) of rooftop gardens and planted walls, the Paris City Hall said. Of this, one-third will be devoted to urban farming.The first wave of projects will lead to the cultivation on 32 sites of 425 tonnes of fruits and vegetables, 24 tonnes of mushrooms, 30,000 flowers, the production of 8,000 litres of beer and 95 kilogrammes of honey.These include a 900 square metre rooftop farming project on top of a French Post Office building housing around 500 employees in northern Paris.Surrounded by high towers, postal workers grow fruit and vegetables including lettuces, aubergines and tomatoes, and breed chickens on 90 tonnes of earth deposited on the roof.“We are postal workers who thought it was nice to be able to fulfil our dream, which is to work for a more edible city,” said Sophie Jankowski, head of Facteur Graine (Seed Postman), which manages the Post Office’s rooftop garden, told Reuters TV.One of the association’s commitment is to use old vegetable varieties, such as high-quality tomatoes which do not travel well over long distances, she said.“We want to give taste to life but also to plates.”The project also changed the way employees see their workplace.“It helps us connect with nature.

301,"COX´S BAZAR: The United Nations on Tuesday drastically increased the estimated number of Rohingya Muslims who have fled violence in Myanmar to 480,000 as Bangladesh eased restrictions on aid groups working in refugee camps and sought $250 million to cope with the crisis.The number who have crossed the border since August 25 to escape a Myanmar military crackdown has increased by 45,000 in two days.Between the new arrivals and some 300,000 Rohingya who were already living in the area due to previous violence in Myanmar, there are now nearly 800,000 refugees in camps around the Bangladesh border town of Cox´s Bazar that are bursting at the seams.The situation has forced new arrivals into makeshift shelters in grim conditions, and sparked warnings that epidemics, including cholera, could easily spread.A report by UN agencies and international charities said the higher number was due largely to an estimated 35,000 Rohingya, not previously accounted for, moving into two refugee camps.It also said numbers crossing the border had started to rise again.After reporting a significant fall in arrivals last week, the new report said hundreds had been crossing the border daily in recent days.Pressure on Bangladesh has increased so much that it has eased restrictions on private aid groups so they can work in Cox´s Bazar camps.The country has previously strictly limited access. It has never given reasons, but is sensitive about security and authorities fear a Muslim influx could tempt extremist groups.The government NGO Affairs Bureau has now cleared 30 local and international groups to meet ""emergency needs"" in camps and said more would follow, Shahdat Hossain, a bureau director, told AFP.The aid groups still only have permission to work in the camps for two months and must focus on providing healthcare, sanitation facilities and shelters for the Rohingya, Hossain said.Authorities had previously only let four international groups -- including Doctors With Border (MSF) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) -- provide food and healthcare.Muslim Aid, a British-based charity, was given permission to operate in Cox´s Bazar last week but this was quickly revoked again. It remains barred even though it operates in other parts of Bangladesh.Authorities briefly ordered MSF, ACF and Muslim Aid to stop providing aid to the Rohingya in 2012.Dhaka-based BRAC, one of the world´s largest charities, is among the new groups allowed into the camps.BRAC senior director Asif Saleh said in a Facebook post that the scale of the ""humanitarian crisis"" was significantly worse than what was being portrayed by the media.He said the group has taken on the ""herculean task"" of setting up 15,000 toilets, 1,100 tube wells, 50 health camps, 10 delivery centres and 50 child centres.Bangladesh has deployed dozens of emergency medical teams and sent reinforcements to hospitals in Cox´s Bazar.They have treated more than 2,350 Rohingya for serious injuries sustained in the crackdown, including bullet and machete wounds and landmine injuries.Some 80,000 Rohingya children have also been vaccinated for measles, rubella and polio diseases and thousands of adults treated for diarrhoea, respiratory diseases and pregnancy complications.Desperately needing more help, junior health minister Zahid Malek said Dhaka has sought $250 million from the World Bank to provide healthcare to the Rohingya.A United Nations official last week said it would need $200 million over the next six months to handle the Rohingya crisis.The UN made an emergency appeal for $78 million on September 9, but UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, Robert Watkins, said much more would be needed as the exodus grows."
302,"GROVE: A Formula One racing team is employing technology that helps racing drivers survive high speed crashes to create a new device that keeps newborn babies safe during emergency transportation.The device, known as the Babypod 20, is made from carbon fiber - the same material used in Formula One cars’ bodywork. It can withstand a 20 g-force impact and provides newborns with a secure, temperature-controlled environment for ambulance transportation.It was designed and built by Williams Advanced Engineering, an arm of the UK-based Williams F1 team, in collaboration with healthcare firm Advanced Healthcare Technology (AHT).“This challenge of providing a lightweight, strong pod to put infants in to be moved around is absolutely the same challenge, virtually, as we’re trying to tackle in the main chassis of a Formula 1 car,” Paul McNamara, Technical Director at Williams Advanced Engineering, told Reuters.“We need it to be strong, light, and crash-proof.”There were 7,938 medical transfers of newborn children in the UK in the 12 months up to June 2017, according to the UK’s Neonatal Transport Group, a medical association specializing in the transporting children.Typically, providing emergency transport to newborn children requires the use of large incubators, which require a power supply and specialist vehicles.The pods are now being used by the UK’s Children’s Acute Transport Service. Eithne Polke, the service’s operational manager, said the design had “made a big difference to our transportation processes”.Williams says it expects to make around 500 of the devices in the first year of production.F1 teams frequently put their engineering know-how to use outside the sport.Williams’ rivals McLaren have applied data management and race simulation expertise to help London’s Heathrow airport improve movements on the ground and reduce the time spent by planes circling overhead.Williams previously developed a device to save money and energy by using aerodynamic technology developed through racing to keep more cold air inside open-fronted refrigerators."
303,"KARACHI: A delegation of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, including Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Firdous Shamim among others, met with the leaders of Muttahida Quami Movement-Pakistan on Tuesday. The leaders met at MQM's temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad.According to sources, the leaders of the two parties mulled over the possibility of replacing Pakistan Peoples Party stalwart Khursheed Shah as the leader of opposition in the National Assembly, before the caretaker government steps in ahead of 2018 General Elections.After the meeting, MQM-Pakistan Head Farooq Sattar said that MQM supported the resolution proposed by the PTI, adding that the parties discussed country’s political situation. Addressing a press conference after the meeting, Shah Mehmood Qureshi remarked: ""We have no personal grievances against anyone. We respect Khursheed Shah.”The conditions of the city can’t improve till we have an effective local bodies system. ""What is the point of a mayor if he doesn’t have power?"" added Shah. It is unfair if people don’t get adequate facilities despite casting their votes, he remarked, adding that the party leaders discussed a lot of issues with MQM-Pakistan. However, while speaking on Geo News' show Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath, MQM-P chief Farooq Sattar said they will not take a solo flight like PPP did and would wait for Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and Jamaat-e-Islami's stance on the matter.Nevertheless, Sattar added, they were planning to do something over the matter in October.Meanwhile, PTI has started making efforts to replace the opposition leader with its own senior member, Shah Mehmood Qureshi.PTI has also established back door contact with Muttahida Qaumi Movement-PakistanThe caretaker government is set up in consultation between the opposition and the present government.PTI officials said if all the opposition parties unite against the PPP then a new opposition leader can emerge in the Lower House of Parliament.Leader of the opposition Khursheed Shah speaking to media in Jaccobabad said that Imran Khan always strengthened his opponent Nawaz Sharif through wrong policies.“Imran Khan was outside on the roads, I brought him inside (parliament),” said Shah.“I fought for them, got them salaries of eight months,” said the opposition leader.Shah said that he brought the Muttahida Quami Movement lawmakers back to the parliament as well.The PPP does not apply the politics of enmity, he said, adding that the party only wants supremacy of democracy and parliament.In his response earlier on Monday, Shah said that the PTI disgraced itself by approaching the leadership of MQM-P to challenge his position in the National Assembly.Shah further said that the PTI should first apologise to the MQM-P's leadership for the accusations they have been leveling against it in the past."

307,"GENEVA: The World Health Organization said Tuesday it has completed a massive cholera vaccination campaign in restive northeastern Nigeria, where the disease has already killed 54 people.The week-long campaign allowed 844,000 people to receive one dose of the vaccine, which offers protection against the deadly disease for six months, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told reporters in Geneva.Northeastern Nigeria is in the grip of a humanitarian crisis caused by the Boko Haram insurgency, which has killed at least 20,000 people and displaced more than 2.6 million.As of Monday, nearly 4,000 suspected cases of cholera had been detected in the region in just over a month, according to WHO numbers.Cholera is transmitted through contaminated drinking water and causes acute diarrhoea, with children facing a particularly high risk of infection.With 54 related deaths so far, the case fatality rate, which measures the severity of an epidemic by defining the proportion of fatal cases within a specific timeframe, is currently at 1.4 percent -- well above the emergency threshold of one percent.The first cholera case was identified in Borno State on August 16 and has since spread, mainly in camps for those displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency.Two doses of the vaccine are needed to offer full protection, but in emergency situations, the WHO allows for a single dose to be given to speed up the coverage.Water-borne diseases are a constant threat because of a lack of adequate sanitation as well as stagnant groundwater during the current rainy season.In addition to the vaccination campaign, WHO and other aid organisations are helping the Nigerian government to respond to the outbreak by establishing cholera treatment centres, ""increasing outreach to communities with information on cholera and on prevention"", Jasarevic said.Providing access to safe water was also a priority, he said.About 8.5 million people in Nigeria´s northeast, out of 17 million in the wider Lake Chad region encompassing Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger, need humanitarian assistance, according to the United Nations.Widespread malnutrition and the severe hygiene crisis in northeastern Nigeria, aggravated by the current rainy season and the limited access to clean water, especially in remote areas and in the overcrowded camps, have sparked growing fears that the cholera epidemic could spread across the region."

311,"RIYADH: A Saudi education official has been sacked over a schoolbook that accidentally included a doctored photograph of a former ruler sitting next to a ""Star Wars"" character, triggering online ridicule.The black-and-white image shows King Faisal, Saudi Arabia's third monarch, signing the United Nations Charter in 1945, with the diminutive Jedi master Yoda perched next to him.Saudi Arabia scrambled last week to withdraw the textbook.The government has sacked Mohammad Bin Atiyah al-Harithi, the deputy education minister for curricula, saying that new versions of the textbook are being printed after the ""inadvertant error"".""Education Minister Ahmed al-Eissa to terminate the mandate of ... Harithi and all those responsible for reviewing and approving textbooks,"" the education ministry said in a statement Monday.The photo was a creation of 26-year-old Saudi artist Abdullah al-Shehri, who has gained renown for mixing pop culture icons into historic photographs.Shehri said he was surprised to see his photograph end up in the school textbook.He told the New York Times that he paired King Faisal and Yoda as they were both intelligent and because Yoda's green skin and lightsaber match the green of the Saudi flag.He stressed he had meant no offence to the king, seen widely as the architect of Saudi Arabia´s modernisation.The error prompted light-hearted banter on social media.One Saudi schoolteacher jested that this error symbolised ""payback"" after the education ministry introduced an extra hour of classes in schools earlier this year.""Remember when Yoda signed the United Nations charter back in 1945 with Faisal of Saudi, @starwars?""""Saudi Ministry of Education does!"" one Twitter user said."
312,"NEW YORK: Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations Dr Maleeha Lodhi said on Tuesday said, referring to United States policies in Afghanistan and the recent revision of the policy for the region, Pakistan cannot endorse any strategy that has repeatedly failed in the past.She was speaking at the UN Security Council’s debate on Afghanistan.""We cannot endorse any strategy that has repeatedly failed in the past and would only prolong and intensify the suffering of the people of Afghanistan as well further destabilize the entire region,” said Lodhi.She also said that the Secretary-General has affirmed the strong international consensus that there was no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.“Pakistan has long advocated this.”Pakistan’s envoy outlined three components of a strategy which she said could restore peace in the war-torn country.She emphasised on a coordinated effort to contain and defeat Daesh and Al Qaeda and their associates, including the TTP, JUA, ETIM and IMU; a sustained dialogue between the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban, including other groups willing to negotiate and effective measures to prevent cross-border attacks by terrorists and militants from or to Afghanistan.She reiterated what Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had stated in the General Assembly last week, “What Pakistan is not prepared to do is fight the Afghan war on Pakistan’s soil.""Lodhi said the fundamental sources of insecurity in Afghanistan lie inside and not outside the country and pointed out that the Afghan government would be better advised to focus more on its persisting challenges and embark on a course correction.Pakistan’s envoy also warned the UN council regarding Daesh’s expanding influence in northern and western provinces.“These are worrying signs for Afghan security and for regional stability.”Lodhi further said that more than 20 terrorist organisations are operating from Afghan soil, which includes the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Jamaat ul Ahrar.“These organisations are conducting terrorist attacks inside Pakistan and pose a threat to Afghanistan's other neighbours,” she added.She urged the Afghan government and Coalition forces present in the country to take decisive action against terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan and said Pakistan continues to face terror attacks from across the Pak-Afghan border, conducted by TTP, JUA and Daesh-related groups.Lodhi called upon the Afghan Taliban to shed violence and agree to resume talks in one or more negotiating formats.“An agreed de-escalation of the conflict and a negotiated settlement offers the best chance to end the suffering of the Afghan people and restore peace and tranquillity within Afghanistan and the region,” said Lodhi.She reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to support all regional and international efforts to promote a peaceful settlement to the internal conflict in Afghanistan and added, “We will continue to do so”.Pakistan’s envoy to the UN also told the Security Council that Pakistan has fought a successful war against terrorism.“Our military operations, involving over 200,000 troops, have crushed and eliminated terrorist groups in our frontier regions and our towns and cities. We have paid a heavy price: 27,000 civilians and soldiers have been martyred; 50,000 injured. Our economic losses are estimated at $120 billion”.Pakistan on the occasion also expressed its commitment to extend all possible assistance to the people of Afghanistan.Lodhi concluded by commenting that while others can afford to orchestrate a proxy war to destabilise Afghanistan and its neighbours, for Pakistan a stable Afghanistan is vital for our own peace, stability and progress."

314,"PARIS: Evaporation, the process that dries washing on the line and supplies clouds with rain water, could one day produce vast stores of clean energy, researchers suggested on Tuesday.Exploiting this natural process could generate up to 325 gigawatts of power over existing lakes and reservoirs in the United States, equivalent to about 70 per cent of the country's electricity generation in 2015, they wrote in the journal Nature Communications.There is only one problem: the technology to harvest this power does not exist.""A device that is placed at the air-water interface would be needed to capture this energy,"" study co-author Ozgur Sahin of Columbia University in New York told AFP.""Moisture that is coming out of the water body would first go into the device before reaching the atmosphere,"" he said. ""The technology has to be developed.""For their study, Sahin and a team relied on models of the energy-generating potential of evaporation, which is the process by which liquid water turns into gas, or vapour.They looked at the impacts of humidity, wind speed and temperature on evaporation rates, and assumed the availability of devices to capture the energy produced as a result.The scientists then calculated the potential of evaporation from water bodies in the United States larger than 100,000 square metres (1 million square feet), other than the Great Lakes.Energy harvesters could be based on the natural action of spores -- tiny structures formed by bacteria in response to harsh environmental conditions. Spores can survive drought or freezing to give rise to new bacteria when conditions improve.""The protective outer layers of spores can absorb and release water when the relative humidity of the surrounding air changes,"" Sahin said.""At high humidity, they absorb water and expand, and at low humidity, they release water and contract. In this process they act like a muscle.""Theoretically, spores can be integrated into materials that generate energy when humidity levels change, as during evaporation.""We have made proof-of-concept devices out of spores that generate electrical energy when they are placed right above water,"" Sahin said.""These devices contain spore-coated plastic strips that elongate and shorten with changing humidity.""We have connected the moving end of the strips to a generator, which produces electricity.""The dam or lake could itself be used to store the sun´s heat -- which drives evaporation -- so that power can be generated only when needed, the team said.Water is an exceptional reservoir of heat, and may provide a solution to the problem of energy ""intermittency"" -- turbines or solar panels that generate power only when wind or sun is available, the team said.Distributing evaporation-derived energy would require proximity to the electricity grid, they added. Reservoirs used to generate hydropower are already well placed.The findings warrant further research into technology to convert energy from evaporation, the researchers said."
315,"COLOMBO: Radical Buddhist monks stormed a United Nations safe house for Rohingya refugees near Sri Lanka's capital Tuesday and forced authorities to relocate the group, officials said.Saffron-robed Buddhist monks led a mob that broke down gates and entered the walled multi-storied compound at the Mount Lavinia suburb of Colombo as frightened refugees huddled together in upstairs rooms, a police official said.Two policemen were wounded in the incident, which also saw the mob pelt stones at the safe house and trash the ground floor furnishings upon entry.There were no reports of casualties among the group of refugees, which included 16 children.""We have pushed back the mob and the refugees have been relocated to a safer place,"" the official told AFP, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Police said they were going through local media video footage as well as Facebook in the hopes of arresting those who took part in the violence, and the monks who incited them.One of the monks who stormed the building posted a video on the social networking site filmed by his radical group Sinhale Jathika Balamuluwa (Sinhalese National Force) as he urged others to join him and smash the premises.""These are Rohingya terrorists who killed Buddhist monks in Myanmar,"" the monk said in his live commentary, pointing to Rohingya mothers with small children in their arms.The 31 Rohingya refugees were rescued by the Sri Lankan navy about five months ago after they were found drifting in a boat off the island´s northern waters. They were thought to be victims of a people smuggler.They were eventually to be resettled in a third country, the official said, adding that they were authorised to remain in Sri Lanka pending the processing of their papers.Sri Lanka's extremist Buddhist monks have close links with their ultra-nationalist counterparts in Myanmar. Both have been accused of orchestrating violence against minority Muslims in the two countries.Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar in the face of the current wave of violence there.The Rohingya Muslims have been the target of decades of state-backed persecution and discrimination in mainly Buddhist Myanmar.Many view them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite their long-established roots in the country."
316,"ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday warned the Iraqi Kurdistan region against pushing for independence after holding a non-binding referendum, saying it risked sparking an ""ethnic war"" in the region.In his latest barrage of warnings to Iraqi Kurdish leader Massud Barzani, Erdogan even warned that his region risked going short on food and clothing if Turkish sanctions were applied.""If Barzani and the Kurdish Regional Government do not go back on this mistake as soon as possible, they will go down in history with the shame of having dragged the region into an ethnic and sectarian war,"" Erdogan said in a televised speech.Iraq's Kurds on Monday voted in a historic independence referendum despite fierce opposition from Baghdad and neighbours Iran and Turkey.Results were expected within 24 hours, with an overwhelming ""yes"" vote not in doubt.Erdogan described the vote as a ""treason to our country"" since it had come at a time of good relations between Ankara and the neighbouring KRG.He urged Barzani to ""give up on an adventure which can only have a dark end.""Erdogan reaffirmed that Turkey - which fears the effects of the vote on its own sizeable Kurdish population - would consider all options, from economic sanctions to military measures.""Airspace and ground (options) are all on the table,"" he said, in an apparent reference to his past threats to close the border.""All options are on the table right now and being discussed,"" he said. ""You (the KRG) will be stuck from the moment we start implementing the sanctions.""Ankara has said it will work more closely with the central government in Baghdad in response to the referendum by Iraqi Kurds. Baghdad has also refused to recognise the referendum.As the first sign of this new policy, Iraqi soldiers on Tuesday took part in a Turkish military drill close to the Iraqi border on Tuesday, an AFP photographer said.Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the Ankara representative of Barzani´s Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), Omer Mirani, who is currently in Arbil, Iraq, had been told not to come back to Turkey.""If he was here, we would tell him to leave the country,"" said Cavusoglu, quoted by Turkish media.Erdogan also reaffirmed his threat to block the Iraqi Kurds´ crucial oil exports that go via the Turkish port of Ceyhan.""The moment we turn off the valve, it is finished, all your income will disappear,"" he said.""When the trucks stop crossing into northern Iraq, they will not find food or clothes ...

The team had submitted a 28-page inquiry report to the Supreme Court on July 9, in which it had endorsed the stance of the JIT probing the offshore assets of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family in connection with the Panama gate case.Hijazi's lawyer, however, had argued in court that SECP staffers did not tamper records of Chaudhry Sugar Mills under duress.

325,"Chinese authorities appear to have severely disrupted the WhatsApp messaging app in the latest step to tighten censorship as they prepare for a major Communist Party congress next month.Users in China have reported widespread disruptions in recent days to the Facebook-owned service, which previously malfunctioned in the country over the summer.Experts said the problems began on Sunday, but text messaging, voice calls and video calls appeared to be working again on Tuesday, though voice messages and photos were not going through.WhatsApp provides message encryption technology that likely does not please Chinese authorities, which closely monitor and restrict cyberspace through their ""Great Firewall"".Many Chinese activists favour WhatsApp over local messaging apps because of its end-to-end encryption function.China has tightened online policing this year, enacting new rules that require tech companies to store user data inside the country as well as imposing restrictions on what is permissible content.Chinese cyberspace regulators said Monday they slapped ""maximum"" fines on major Chinese tech firms Baidu and Tencent for allowing the publication of pornographic, violent and other sorts of banned material on their social media platforms. The amount of the fines was not disclosed.Websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and a slew of foreign media have been blocked for years.The WhatsApp troubles emerged ahead of the Communist Party congress on October 18, when President Xi Jinping is expected to be given a second five-year term as the party´s general secretary.""It smells like Party congress pre-emptive blocking,"" said Jason Ng, who researches China´s internet at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. China usually steps up surveillance around major events, Ng said. While the WeChat messaging app owned by China´s Tencent company is more widely used in the country, many WhatsApp users complained about the disruptions.""As we get closer to the Party congress, I think authorities will use more extreme censorship measures. The public knows that WeChat isn´t safe,"" prominent Beijing-based activist Hu Jia told AFP.""Me and other dissidents use WhatsApp to communicate 70 percent of the time. For the few days WhatsApp was completely inaccessible, we didn´t talk at all,"" Hu said. Earlier this month, WeChat informed its users in a new privacy policy that it would ""retain, preserve or disclose"" users´ data to ""comply with applicable laws or regulations"" -- confirming long-held public assumptions about the company´s practices. Other users in China noted that the WhatsApp disruptions would make it difficult to work with clients abroad.""Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Viber were blocked before. Now even WhatsApp is blocked? Without good messaging tools, it will reduce the efficiency of the foreign trade industry,"" wrote one person on Weibo, China´s Twitter-like social media website.""I can live without the others (applications), but blocking WhatsApp is driving me crazy,"" said another.WhatsApp declined to comment.The Open Observatory of Network Interference, a global censorship detection group, said China started blocking WhatsApp on Sunday.To operate in China, some foreign tech companies have complied with local regulations. But others such as Google have chosen to pull out completely from mainland China.In July, Apple removed software allowing internet users to skirt China´s ""Great Firewall"" from its app store in the country, drawing criticism that it was bowing to Beijing´s ever-growing web censorship.Such software, called virtual private networks (VPN), allow people in China to access any website, even those that are blocked.Beijing mandated in January that all developers must obtain government licences to offer VPNs and there has been concern that it might ban them outright."

332,"Weakened by the worst result for her party since 1949 and facing a more fractious political landscape at home, Germany's Angela Merkel could be forced to rein in plans to re-shape Europe together with France's Emmanuel Macron.Merkel's conservatives garnered more support than any other party in the German election on Sunday, projections showed, ensuring that she will return for a fourth term as chancellor.But her party appeared on track for its poorest performance since the first German election after World War Two and its only path to power may be through an unwieldy, untested three-way coalition with the ecologist Greens and liberal Free Democrats (FDP), fierce critics of Macron's ideas for Europe.Over the next four years, Merkel will also have to cope with a more confrontational opposition force in the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a eurosceptic, anti-immigration party that rode a wave of public anger after her decision to open Germany's borders to hundreds of thousands of migrants in 2015.The AfD was on track to win over 13 percent, above what polls had predicted. They will become the first far-right party to enter the German parliament since the 1950s.This will be a new world for Merkel, who has grown accustomed to cozy coalitions and toothless Bundestag opposition during her 12 years in power.""In my mind, reform of the euro zone is the single most important foreign policy issue that the new government has in front of it,"" said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, who runs the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund.But he predicted a so-called ""Jamaica"" coalition between Merkel's conservatives, the FDP and the Greens - whose combined party colors of black, yellow and green are like those the Jamaican national flag - would struggle to deliver.Whereas the Greens said on Sunday night that a ""stronger Europe"" was a priority for the party, the FDP is averse to further steps to integrate policies at European level.""It would be the party of no, the party of yes and an incrementalist chancellor. Those are not ideal conditions for a Franco-German grand bargain,"" he said.Macron ran for the French presidency on a pledge to ""relaunch"" Europe, in tandem with Germany, after years of economic and financial crisis and the new shock dealt by Britain's vote last year to leave the bloc.He is due to flesh out his ideas in a speech at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Tuesday. Macron has called for a finance minister and budget for the single currency bloc, ideas that Merkel has tentatively supported even though scepticism in her own party runs high.But with the FDP as a partner and the AfD pushing back loudly in parliament, the prospect of selling deeper European integration to her new coalition and the wider public looks far more challenging.In its election program, the FDP called for a phasing out of Europe's ESM bailout fund and changes to EU treaties that would allow countries to leave the euro zone. Its young leader Christian Lindner openly called for Greece to return to the drachma during the campaign.""On Europe, the FDP is not so far from the AfD on some issues. If all of their ideas were implemented we would be plunged back into a euro zone crisis,"" Franziska Brantner, a Greens lawmaker, told Reuters.The FDP would not be the only difficult ally in Merkel's coalition.The AfD's strong performance could push her Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU) -- already a thorn in her side during the refugee crisis -- further to the right ahead of an election next year in its home state.Winning back voters who fled to the AfD could become one of the main priorities for Merkel's conservative bloc over the coming four years. That would mean tougher stances on migration and on Europe.Even before the election, officials close to Merkel were playing down the urgency of a reform of the euro zone, describing efforts to secure Europe's borders and agree a fair distribution of refugees across the bloc as higher priorities.""A second refugee crisis would be more devastating to Europe than a second euro zone crisis,"" a senior German official told Reuters last month.These officials point to the strengthening of the European economy and suggest that Macron was elected despite rather than because of his grand plans for the euro zone.A Bertelsmann Foundation survey last year showed just 41 percent of French believe Europe needs more political and economic integration, 10 points below the EU average.The survey also showed that Germans and French are the most skeptical toward Macron's ideas for a European finance minister and dedicated euro zone budget.Only 31 percent of French and 39 percent of Germans thought a euro zone budget should be used to support economically weaker states, as Macron suggests."

""He declared a war on our country.""The White House disputed Ri's interpretation of Trump's sabre-rattling.""We have not declared war against North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Alarm over Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes dominated this year's gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, amid fears the heated rhetoric could accidentally trigger a war.Those fears were sharpened after US bombers flew off the coast of North Korea on Saturday -- going furthest north of the demilitarized zone that any US aircraft has flown this century.""Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to take counter-measures including the right to shoot down US strategic bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country,"" said Ri.""The question of who won't be around much longer will be answered then.""South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that while Pyongyang did not appear to have picked up the presence of the US B-1B Lancer warplanes over the weekend, it had since moved to bolster its coastal defences.""North Korea relocated its warplanes and strengthened defences along the east coast,"" said Lee Cheol-Woo, the chief of the National Assembly's intelligence committee.As the rhetoric heated up, South Korea appealed for an easing of tensions, with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha saying that further provocations can be expected from Pyongyang but must not be allowed to get out of control.""It is imperative that we, Korea and the US together, manage the situation... in order to prevent further escalation of tensions or any kind of accidental military clashes which can quickly go out of control,"" Kang said in Washington.South Korea has reacted with unease to Trump's threat to ""totally destroy"" North Korea as its densely-populated capital Seoul is located just 35 miles from the demilitarized zone dividing the Korean peninsula.In his UN address last week, Trump delivered the blunt threat, deriding leader Kim Jong-un as ""Rocket Man"" and declaring he was ""on a suicide mission"".Kim hit back with a personal attack on Trump, branding him ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"" and warning he would ""pay dearly"" for his threat.There have been repeated appeals for calm from the United Nations, Russia and China.Asked about the North Korean minister's latest remarks, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said: ""When you have the rise of tension, the rise of rhetoric, so does the risk of miscalculation.""North Korea has in recent weeks detonated its sixth nuclear bomb and test-fired intercontinental missiles -- saying it needs to defend itself against the threat of a US invasion.A Pentagon spokesman stressed on Monday that the bombers flew in international airpace and had every right to do so.In his UN address, Ri warned that Trump's threat to destroy North Korea made ""our rockets' visit to the entire US mainland all the more inevitable"".The bellicose rhetoric comes as international alarm mounts over Pyongyang's weapons ambitions -- including a suggestion by Ri last week that the country is considering detonating an H-bomb over the Pacific.US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said such a move would be a ""shocking display of irresponsibility.""As tensions over North Korea reached fever-pitch, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap election, hoping to capitalize on a boost in the polls that some say is linked to his hawkish stance toward Pyongyang.Asian financial markets sank in early trade Tuesday, as investors sought out safe havens in response to the flare-up in tensions. Gold was up more than one percent, while the Japanese yen recovered recent losses against the dollar."
336,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, addressing a press conference at Punjab House on Tuesday after his appearance at a NAB court, said he was not the one to flee judicial proceedings He once again questioned the grounds of his disqualification once more as well as the way the corruption cases against him are proceeding.  Senior party leaders, including Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, were present alongside the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader. Nawaz began his address by deploring the incident at the accountability court earlier today when a journalist was manhandled. The former premier said he had gone to London to be with his ailing wife, but rumours were created stating that he would not return. The former premier said despite false cases and torture, he never bowed down before a dictator.

He said the 12 questions he raised in the lawyers' convention in Lahore have not been answered. ""The answers to those questions cannot come either,"" he claimed.Nawaz said not a single penny worth of corruption or misuse of power was proved, adding that as a result the Iqama excuse was used to disqualify him. ""They should have told the people that nothing was found in the Panama Papers,"" he remarked. He observed how he could accept the verdict when even the legal community has rejected it. ""I and my children appeared before the JIT which was surreptitiously formed after 'Whatsapp calls'. Some JIT members were themselves facing inquiries,"" he narrated.Around 1,500 security personnel were deployed to secure the route from Punjab House to Sector G-11, where the court is located, as well as the courts complexNawaz said he still hopes, despite everything, that there will be justice.  ""Let the 200 million people decide the issue of disqualification,"" shared the ousted prime minister. Nawaz said he's facing cases based on lies, but added that he has decided to contest the cases for ""Quaid-e-Azam's Pakistan, 200 million people of the country, sanctity of vote and all those prime ministers who could not complete their terms"". The three-time premier said he knows what his real 'crime' is, adding that he will, however, continue to stand with his people. In the end, he thanked the voters of NA-120, Lahore — his home constituency — for ensuring the victory of his wife and party candidate Kulsoom Nawaz and further said a bigger decision will come in 2018, referring to the general elections. ""I will continue to render sacrifices for the country,"" concluded Nawaz.Kulsoom Nawaz received 61,254 votes while Dr. Yasmin Rashid finished second with 47,066 votesNawaz returned to the country on Monday after spending over three weeks in London to spend time with his wife, Kulsoom, who is undergoing treatment for lymphoma. On Tuesday, Nawaz appeared before the accountability court which is hearing three corruption references against him and his family. The court has set October 2 as the date of the next hearing, when it will indict the ousted prime minister. After his court appearance, Nawaz returned to the Punjab House, where he met several political leaders and party officials, including Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman."

341,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has introduced a number of changes to its playing conditions which will go into effect starting September 28.The significant changes include a restriction on the dimensions of the bat, the introduction of player send-offs for misconduct and changes to the Decision Review System, all of which will commence from the upcoming Test series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka and between South Africa and Bangladesh.“Most of the changes to the ICC playing conditions are being made as a result of changes to the Laws of Cricket that have been announced by the MCC. We have just completed a workshop with the umpires to ensure they understand all of the changes and we are now ready to introduce the new playing conditions to international matches,” said ICC General Manager – Cricket, Geoff Allardice, in a press release. The restriction on the length and width of bats remains unchanged, but the thickness of the edges cannot be more than 40mm and the overall depth can be at most 67mm. Umpires will be able to use a new bat gauge to check a bat’s legality.A player can now be sent off the field for the rest of the match for any serious misconduct falling under Level 4 offences. Threatening to assault an umpire, making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with an umpire, physically assaulting a player or any other person and committing any other act of violence all constitute Level 4 offences.A DRS review will now not be lost in case of a decision that remains unchanged, solely as the result of an ‘umpire’s call’.As for DRS in Test matches, there will be no more top-up reviews after 80 overs of an innings, meaning that there can only be two unsuccessful reviews in each innings, while the DRS will now also be allowed to be used in T20Is.Regarding run outs, if a batsman is running or diving towards the crease with forward momentum, and has grounded his/her bat behind the popping crease but subsequently has lost contact with the ground at the time of the wickets being put down, the batsman will not be run out. The same interpretation will also apply for a batsman trying to regain his/her ground to avoid being stumped, the ICC release stated.For boundary catches, airborne fielders making their first contact with the ball will need to have taken off from within the boundary; otherwise a boundary will be scored.A batsman can now be out caught, stumped or run out even if the ball bounces off the helmet worn by a fielder or wicket-keeper, the release further stated. "
342,"SEOUL/NEW YORK: North Korea has been boosting defenses on its east coast, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said on Tuesday, after the North said US President Donald Trump had declared war and that it would shoot down US bombers flying near the Korean peninsula.Tensions have escalated on the Korean peninsula since North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, but the rhetoric has reached a new level in recent days with leaders on both sides exchanging threats and insults.North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said Trump’s Twitter comments, in which the US leader said Ri and leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer” if they acted on their threats, amounted to a declaration of war and that Pyongyang had the right to take countermeasures.Yonhap suggested the reclusive North was in fact bolstering its defenses by moving aircraft to its east coast and taking other measures after U.S. bombers flew close to the Korean peninsula at the weekend.The unverified Yonhap report said the United States appeared to have disclosed the flight route of the bombers intentionally because North Korea seemed to be unaware. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service was unable to confirm the report immediately.Ri said on Monday the North’s right to countermeasures included shooting down US bombers “even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country”.“The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country,” he told reporters in New York on Monday, where he had been attending the annual United Nations General Assembly.“The question of who won’t be around much longer will be answered then,” he said.White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders denied on Monday that the United States had declared war, calling the suggestion “absurd”.US Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers escorted by fighter jets flew east of North Korea in a show of force after a heated exchange of rhetoric between Trump and Kim over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.North Korea has been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, which Trump has said he will never allow.The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea after the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended in a truce and not a peace treaty.The Sept. 3 nuclear test prompted a new round of sanctions on North Korea after the Security Council voted unanimously on a resolution condemning the test.The North says it needs its weapons programs to guard against U.S. invasion and regularly threatens to destroy the United States, South Korea and Japan.However, the rhetoric has been ratcheted up well beyond normal levels recently, raising fears that a miscalculation by either side could have massive repercussions.Trump’s threat last week to totally destroy North Korea, a country of 26 million people, if it threatened the United States or its allies led to an unprecedented direct statement by Kim in which he called Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” and said he would tame the U.S. threat with fire.White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster defended Trump’s rhetoric and said on Monday he agreed that the risk was that Kim might fail to realize the danger he and his country were facing.However, McMaster also acknowledged the risks of escalation with any US military option.“We don’t think there’s an easy military solution to this problem,” said McMaster, who believed any solution would be an international effort.“There’s not a precision strike that solves the problem. There’s not a military blockade that can solve the problem,” McMaster said.China, North Korea’s sole major ally and largest trading partner, has called for calm and dialogue, while world leaders such as U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the only solution to the crisis was a political one.China’s U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said Beijing wanted the situation “to calm down”.“It’s getting too dangerous and it’s in nobody’s interest,” Liu told Reuters in New York."

348,"KARANGASEM, INDONESIA: Vehicles laden with food, masks and bedding have been dispatched to help more than 57,000 people who have fled a volcano on the tourist island of Bali, as rising magma and increased tremors fuel fears of an imminent eruption.Mount Agung, about 75 kilometres (47 miles) from the Indonesian tourist hub of Kuta, has been rumbling since August, threatening to erupt for the first time since 1963.""The chance that an eruption will happen is quite big. But it cannot be predicted when it will happen,"" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the disaster mitigation agency, said.The increased frequency of tremors shows the magma continuing to move towards the surface, with the mountain entering a ""critical phase"", the spokesman said.The Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation said there has been an increase in volcanic tremors, with a total of 564 recorded Monday.Evacuees have packed into temporary shelters or moved in with relatives. Some 2,000 cows have also been evacuated from the flanks of the volcano.Balinese residents, international NGOs and the government have begun organising aid.Vehicles filled with noodles, mineral water and blankets have been sent to the evacuation centres, while residents around the island have been collecting donations for those affected.Bali's ""sister village"" programme and tradition of communal assistance means evacuees have been able to stay in villages outside the danger zone.Around 62,000 people lived in the danger zone prior to the evacuations, according to the disaster mitigation agency.I Ketut Subandi, head of logistics at the village of Tana Ampo, said basic food items like rice, instant noodles, cooking oil and water were most needed.""This morning we were worried because we had limited rice supply, but now we have received more rice stocks from donors,"" Subandi said.Indonesia's national disaster agency has dispatched 640,000 face masks, 12,500 mattresses, 8,400 blankets, 50 tents, and has a budget of $75,000 for assistance.The central government has set aside a relief fund of nearly $150 million in case of an eruption.Officials announced the highest possible alert level on Friday due to the increasing volcanic activity, and told people to stay at least nine kilometres away from the crater.""Our preparedness will be the key for the mitigations of volcanic risks,"" Devy Kamil, a senior official at Indonesia's Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, told AFP.Trekking tours on the mountain have been cancelled by operators but officials have otherwise been at pains to assure tourists the island is safe.The airport in Bali's capital Denpasar, through which millions of foreign tourists pass every year, has not been affected, but several countries including Australia and Singapore have put out a travel advisory.Mount Agung is one of more than 120 active volcanoes extending the length of Indonesia, which straddles the Pacific Ring of Fire.It last erupted in 1963, killing nearly 1,600 people and sending ash as far as the capital Jakarta."

The two discussed the country's political situation, according to sources. Later, another ally of PML-N, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai is also expected to meet Nawaz. Earlier, Nawaz was also given a detailed briefing by his legal team on today's hearing in the accountability court. Nawaz returned to Pakistan on Monday after spending over three weeks in London. A number of PML-N leaders descended on Punjab House — where Nawaz is residing — early morning to see-off the former premier. Sources said a number of party leaders and government officials were accompanying Nawaz as well in his 37-vehicle convoy, however, only the vehicle carrying Nawaz and his legal counsel were allowed inside the court complex. Security arrangements The Islamabad administration made special traffic and security arrangements in and around Sector G-11, where the court is located. Sources said around 1,500 police personnel were deployed to secure the route of the former premier whereas Rangers and Elite Force personnel will secure the courts complex. Sharif family members in London to be with Kulsoom Nawaz, Senator Kirmani tells courtNawaz, his daughter Maryam, sons Hussain and Hasan, and son-in-law MNA Capt (retd) Safdar had all been summoned by the accountability court. However, only Nawaz appeared in person today as the rest are with his wife, Kulsoom, who is undergoing treatment for lymphoma in London. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has filed three references against Nawaz and his family, pertaining to which an accountability court summoned them on September 19.However, the Sharifs failed to appear before the court as they were all in London. The court then set September 26 (today) as the next date of hearing, issuing another summons for the Sharif family. NAB, in total, has filed three references against the Sharif family and one against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in the accountability court in light of the Supreme Court's orders in the Panama Papers case verdict of July 28.The bureau was given six weeks, from the date of the apex court's order, to file the reference in an accountability court while the accountability court was granted six months to wrap up the proceedings.The court's registrar raised objections over the references, saying there were several missing documentsThe references against the Sharif family pertain to the Al Azizia Steel Mills, their London properties and over dozen offshore companies. NAB's Rawalpindi branch prepared references regarding the Azizia Steel Mills and the nearly dozen companies owned by the Sharif family.The bureau's Lahore branch prepared a reference on the Sharif family's Avenfield apartments in London and another against Dar for owning assets beyond his known sources of income.If convicted, the accused can face up to 14 years imprisonment and lifelong disqualification from holding public office including the freezing of bank accounts and assets. "
351," Since 2002, the Pakistan Army has launched eight full-scale military operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, along the Pak-Afghan border, in order to expel a variety of militants. The latest of which was Operation Zarb-e-Azb.The assaults triggered a mass displacement of people fleeing the conflict-affected areas. Initially, those seeking shelter, whose numbers varied over the years, were categorized as the ‘Internally Displaced Persons.' Later, the name was revised to ‘Temporarily Displaced Persons.'After facilitating them in makeshift camps for several years, in 2015, the government began a phased return plan for the TDPs. There was much celebration and then much disappointment. For the people of FATA, the trek back home has not been easy. In order to facilitate the homecoming, last year the state announced US $4,000 for the rebuilding of houses reduced to rubble and $2,000 for damaged properties.That, if you ask the residents, isn't much.Most of FATA's terrain is mountainous. Building a home there is difficult. Preparing the groundwork and getting the construction machinery and materials up an uneven surface increases the cost. The residents of the area first buy the materials from Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and Bannu. And then pay exorbitant fares to have a truck transport them to the tribal belt. The intermittent rain and seasonal snow further complicate the efforts.Then, there is a shortage of skilled labour in FATA. During the displacement phase, labour from the tribal areas was employed by NGOs and firms to work in other cities. Few of them have returned since then.In pockets, free movement is also a big challenge. Neighbourhoods are laced with landmines left earlier by residents to protect themselves against militants and to settle disputes. These homemade bombs have remained uncovered, posing a serious threat to life. In South Waziristan alone, in the last six months, over 70 people have been killed or injured by the blasts, according to Manzoor Ahmed Pashteen, a social activist from South Waziristan, who helps treat the victims.It is a tall task, rebuilding a home, and rebuilding it in a budget of $4,000. If one manages to achieve that, the next step is trying to address the lack of basic utilities, water and sewage systems. The string of military assaults has damaged FATA's infrastructure, which now needs a major rethink by the federal government. Gas is in short supply. Internet and phone lines are torn. In addition, hovering over the recovery efforts are corruption and mismanagement. There are few, if any, land records in FATA. Residents are finding it increasingly hard to find the boundaries of their land, which in turn creates further chaos between neighbours.It the time for the government to realize that rebuilding FATA will require more than just handing out cash and cheques.Mehsud is a freelance journalist.The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."
352,"On the morning of May 8, 2002, the New Zealand cricket team assembled in the lobby of the Pearl Continental Hotel in Karachi, preparing to take on Pakistan at the National Stadium on the first day of the second Test. Outside, in the circular drive, a bus carrying French engineers was getting ready to leave for the Naval Dockyards. Unnoticed by anyone, a car sneaked in, drove right up to the bus, and blew up. The impact of the bomb ripped through the bus, shattering glass in the lobby, tearing apart the windows of the rooms upstairs. Eleven engineers on board the bus died, along with two Pakistanis. A less bemoaned casualty was the New Zealand team’s tour. A shaken Stephen Fleming, the captain of the team, told reporters that the blast left him shattered. Team manager Jeff Crowe read out a statement in a press briefing, which said that while he felt sorry for Pakistan and its cricket board, it was time to go home. The tour was called off, and the first blow to international cricket in Pakistan hit bull’s eye.Many cricketing nations hesitated about playing in Pakistan after this incident, but were somehow convinced to visit, and so our grounds were not empty. At least not then. New Zealand itself came back in 2003 and West Indies had a memorable tour here in 2006-2007. And then came the fateful events of March 2009 when the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked by terrorists in the early hours of the morning, just as their bus was a few hundred feet away from the stadium. The alert driver managed to save all the passengers on board his bus with an extraordinary display of bravery. The tour was called off and with it the doors to hosting international cricket were closed to Pakistan.For a nation that loved the game as much as Pakistanis did, this was a blow of staggering proportions. Home series were to be played in the neutral grounds of the UAE from there on, with spectators here forced to watch on their screens, any dream of cheering their team in person under the brilliant floodlights of their home grounds squashed, seemingly forever.Equally demoralized was the Pakistan cricket team itself, used to displaying histrionics in front of roaring home crowds. Yet they trudged on, shrugging off the setback. As fate would have it, far away from their fans, the team blossomed into a cohesive side, formidable opponents displaying the same prowess as did the fabled team of the 90s. The green shirts managed to win the T20 World Cup, and under Misbah ul Haq’s capable leadership, many a Test series, each notable for the determination the team showed in beating the odds.Yet, at home, the odds of international cricket returning were slim to none. In this scenario, Najam Sethi took over the Pakistan Cricket Board and decided that the old dream, the Pakistan Super League, will be a reality. The first season of the PSL was successful, despite the bets being stacked against Pakistan. PSL marked a turning point, one that affected not just international cricket but domestic too. Many talented players emerged on the national scene. This new blood injected new life into the team, which was evident when Pakistan managed to win the Champions Trophy, comprehensively defeating archrivals India to lift the cup.One last challenge remained, that of bringing international cricket back to Pakistan’s empty grounds. Zimbabwe did tour Pakistan for three matches in 2015, but that could not be termed the return of cricket, despite packed grounds. After all, Zimbabwe was good, but the superstars of the game were not there. More remained to be done, and finally, in 2017, the World XI came here to play three T20s. Full of the biggest names the game had to offer, the star-studded team came to Lahore. It doesn’t get any bigger than Faf du Plessis, Hashim Amla, Darren Sammy, Grant Elliott and Imran Tahir. When the week was over, Pakistan had won the series by 2-1. Ecstatic Pakistanis supported the touring team as much as they supported their own players. Every boundary, every wicket, regardless of whom it came against, was met with thunderous applause. Just a stone’s throw away, at the site of the attack on Sri Lanka, the ground reverberated with cheers carrying through from the Gaddafi Stadium.With every round of ovation, the clouds of doom that lingered over the Liberty roundabout, lifted a bit, until finally they were dispersed altogether.One unwanted consequence of the matches was the lockdown Lahore had to go through. Public routes had to be closed or traffic had to be re-routed through other roads. Citizens were stuck for hours in traffic jams the likes of which the city had never seen before. While it is true that law enforcement agencies left no stone unturned to protect the visiting team, it is also unfortunately true that ambulances were stalled, workers reached their offices late and left early, students were either given the entire week off or were let go early. Businesses on the adjoining roads were either forced to shut down for the week or had practically no business as most people stayed home to avoid the traffic. Over 6,000 policemen were stationed at various points in the city. If Sri Lanka is to visit in October, and West Indies is to play here in November, then is Lahore to go through the same kind of lockdown? A workable solution would be to make sure that other cities are also given a chance to host the games, thus reducing the burden off of Lahore.Lastly, while we are grateful to the World XI for coming here to us, we must be equally thankful to the police, the military and the Rangers who made this event a success. Day and night, in the crippling heat, they carried out their duties with the utmost responsibility. In the end, the green shirts may have won the series, but victory was not theirs alone. It belonged to the security personnel outside, it belonged to the PCB, it belonged to the ICC, it belonged to each player in the World XI, and finally, it belonged to the game itself and its fans here, who had waited loyally for almost a decade to see a player raise his bat and salute them.The writer is a researcher at Geo TV and can be contacted at [email protected]"

355,"ABU DHABI: Pakistan will step into a new Test era without retired batting greats Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq when they take on Sri Lanka in the first Test in Abu Dhabi from Thursday.Playing without Younis and Misbah is unaccustomed territory for Pakistan, who haven´t had a Test featuring neither of the talismanic, prolific pair in seven years.It comes as they prepare to welcome the return of full international cricket to their home country next month, when Sri Lanka visit for a Twenty20 game in Lahore.Together, Younis and Misbah have appeared in 193 Tests, accumulating 15,331 runs, 44 centuries and 15 century stands between them, briefly lifting the team to the top of the Test rankings in August last year.They have dominated the batting at Pakistan´s venues in United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they have been forced to play home games since a deadly terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore in 2009.The pair made Pakistan so invincible that they have not lost any of the nine series they have played in UAE, with new captain Sarfraz Ahmed admitting it will be tough to replace them.""Obviously, it´s not easy to fill the void they left as they were the backbone of our batting,"" said Sarfraz.""Their contributions were immense but now we have to move on.""Younis is not only Pakistan´s highest Test runs scorer, with 10,099, but the slips fielding specialist also holds the national record of 139 catches in 118 Tests.Misbah´s calm influence as a batsman, as well as skipper, will also be tough to replace.Fast-rising batsman Babar Azam at four and Haris Sohail, who is yet to play a Test, will attempt to fill the void, while Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq will also be expected to play a leading role.Azhar was in doubt for the first Test after suffering a knee injury but he has since responded well to treatment, while Yasir Shah will lead the spin attack in a squad with five fast bowlers.Shah, who took 24 wickets in Pakistan´s 2-1 series win in Sri Lanka two years ago, will be assisted by uncapped spinners Mohammad Asghar and Bilal Asif.Sri Lanka, who lost 3-0 at home to India last month, will be looking to right the ship after a torrid run of results which has had the media and fans on their back.But they will be without their key all-rounder and former captain Angelo Mathews, who has been ruled out of the first Test with a calf strain.Skipper Dinesh Chandimal believes his team will have to be at their best to beat Pakistan, despite the lack of their two long serving players.""Pakistan will definitely miss Misbah and Younis but we will not underestimate the youngsters they have and (we) have to be at our best to beat them,"" he said.Sri Lanka will be buoyed by the return of their pace spearheads Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal, who suffered injuries last month.But their main hope of winning the two-match series looks likely to hinge on veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who has 90 wickets in 19 Tests against Pakistan.Pakistan: Sarfraz Ahmed (capt), Azhar Ali, Shan Masood, Sami Aslam, Babar Azam, Asad Shafiq, Haris Sohail, Usman Salahuddin, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Asghar, Bilal Asif, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali, Mohammad Abbas, Wahab RiazSri Lanka: Dinesh Chandimal (capt), Lahiru Thirimanne (vice-capt), Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva, Kusal Mendis, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Roshen Silva, Niroshan Dickwella, Rangana Herath, Lakshan Sandakan, Dilruwan Perera, Suranga Lakmal, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Lahiru GamageUmpires: Ian Gould (ENG) and Nigel Llong (ENG)TV umpire: Richard Kettleborough (ENG)ICC match referee: Andy Pycroft (ZIM)"
356,"LONDON: Arsenal kept up their 100 percent home record this season with a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Monday, with new club record signing Alexandre Lacazette grabbing both the goals.West Brom had lost on their previous six visits to the Gunners but started the match brightly and were even denied a penalty after only seven minutes of play.Gareth Barry, appearing in a record 633rd Premier League fixture and the Baggies’ captain for the night, released the ball to Jay Rodriguez in the area who cut back and was brought down by defender Shkodran Mustafi.However, no foul was given by referee Bobby Madley, much to the frustration of manager Tony Pulis on the touchline and Rodriguez himself.“For me I felt contact and I went down and I was waiting for the foul to be given but it wasn‘t,” the striker told Sky Sports. “For me it was a penalty, but you get them and you don‘t... It’s difficult when it’s 0-0 and if you get the decision you can get a goal which changes the game.”Arsene Wenger’s side took the lead after 20 minutes, Lacazette heading in after goalkeeper Ben Foster had pushed Alexis Sanchez’s free-kick on to the bar.The goal meant that the close season signing from Lyon became the first Arsenal player to score in his opening three home fixtures in the league since 1988.The Frenchman scored his fourth of the season and Arsenal’s second of the match from the penalty spot, midway through the second half, after a clumsy barge on Aaron Ramsey in the box by Allan Nyom.After the final whistle, Welshman Ramsey was full of praise for his new free-scoring teammate.“Lacazette is fantastic. He has lovely touches and knows where the back of the net is,” he said.Arsenal moved up to seventh in the league on 10 points, six behind both Manchester clubs at the top. West Brom dropped to 12th and have now gone five games without a win in all competitions.The Gunners can continue their home run on Sunday against Brighton and Hove Albion, a day after West Brom host Watford."

359,"NEW YORK: Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have little choice but to rein in internet political ads in the face of growing US government pressure, a panel of advertising consultants and executives said on Monday.Speaking at a trade conference, the marketers seized on allegations that Russian operatives bought US political ads on Facebook as evidence that the sector cannot go on being unregulated.“I think there will be more scrutiny, and there better be more self-regulation. Otherwise, I think regulation will be coming,” Brent McGoldrick, a political ad consultant and a Republican, said at Advertising Week New York.Last week, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg vowed to do more to deter governments from using Facebook to manipulate elections in other countries, after the company disclosed $100,000 in Russian ad purchases in the months before and after the 2016 US presidential election.The 3,000 ads included some that highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women, as well as others that showed a deep understanding of US social divides, the Washington Post reported on Monday.Facebook shares ended down 4.5 percent on Monday, closing at $162.87, as some investors worried the tech sector had become too expensive.Zuckerberg has also unveiled sweeping changes to how his company handles political ads, saying it would make them visible to all users regardless of whom the ads target.Andrew Capone, senior vice president of NCC Media, a cable trade group, joked on Monday’s panel that during the 2016 election campaign, “Facebook took in over 300 million rubles - I‘m sorry, dollars.”McGoldrick said on the panel: “If I were Facebook and Google and everyone else, I would be developing a code of conduct and a set of criteria. They may already exist, but obviously it’s not either robust enough or transparent enough.”Google has said it has no evidence on its ad platform of a Russian propaganda campaign like the one Facebook found.The two Silicon Valley firms are set to take a combined 63 percent of the US market this year, according to research firm eMarketer.Though Facebook and Google have for years resisted regulation of political ads, congressional investigators and US special counsel Robert Mueller have helped to change the situation, said Jefrey Pollock, president of public relations firm Global Strategy Group.“Things change with a subpoena,” Pollock, a Democrat, said as part of the panel."

But he told Obama that those messages weren´t widespread on Facebook and that there was no easy remedy,"" the newspaper said, quoting people it said had knowledge of the exchange.The report comes days after Facebook announced it would be handing over to Congress advertisements it discovered were bought by Russia-linked fake accounts, aimed at inflaming political tensions ahead of and following the election.The Kremlin has denied any involvement."

""Pakistan caught operatives like Indian Commander Kalbushan Yadav red-handed, who were involved in sabotage activities, spreading terror and violence across Pakistan, we will catch others as well and bring them to justice,"" he added.On Monday, the Indian delegate, Paulomi Tripathi, glossed over Kashmir, the core dispute between India and Pakistan, and instead spoke of the photo displayed in the Assembly by Ambassador Lodhi.""The Indian representative has once again chosen to divert the attention of the international community from the real issue — the real issue of human life, of human eyes, of children and infants blinded forever, of women raped and elderly killed every day by the reign of brutality unleashed by the occupation forces in Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The real issue is of Security Council resolutions, which India refuses to implement,"" said Usman"
362,"Political alarm bells have begun to ring after the recent secondary dissection of the rightist vote bank into sectarian divisions after a period of 40 long years. It was in 1977 when the leftist and rightist split (PPP and anti-PPP) came into being and the trend continued, nuanced, for four decades.Political divides in a polarised society are natural but when politics is engineered for certain vested interests it becomes disastrous. Such sinister interference in 1979 had the unkindest cut of all on the political and social fabric of the country. To counter the PPP in the 1980s two ethnic and sectarian groups – the Mohajir Qaumi Movement and Sipah-e-Sahaba, respectively – were encouraged. After four decades of this innocent mischief we can still feel the heat of that interference. This resulted in a Shia-Sunni conflict as well as Mohajir-Sindhi rivalry, and bloody clashes between Mohajirs and Pakhtuns. Hundreds were killed in Mohajirs’ clashes with the Balochs and the Pakhtuns. Despite this blunder, which kept the country bleeding for four decades, again two groups with a rather aggressive background have been allowed to enter the political arena on the behest of our cruel strategists. In the 1980s, the target was the PPP but in 2017 the goal was to reduce or disperse the vote bank for the N-League.Political realities have also changed in the last four decades. The sad political demise of the PPP and the emergence of the second rightist party, the PTI, after the PML-N had confused the rightist vote bank. Now the rightist voter has no fear of a PPP victory and is not bound to support the PML-N at any cost to save his right-wing ideology. Now he has another right-wing option in the form of the PTI. And the religious right found the new aggressive religious groups – the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan and the Milli Muslim League as per their sectarian aspirations.It is no secret that Pakistani society is segmented into the Deobandi, Barelvi, Shia and Ahl-e-Hadith schools of thought. Though all these sects already have their representative political parties, people have been hardly ever motivated by their own sect’s leadership in case of electoral politics and they have usually voted for major political parties of their own free will. But this time in NA-120, almost 15,000 people followed sectarian leaders in their choice of vote.The Sharifs have had a role to play in the mishandling of the religious card too. There were times when the patriarch of the family, Mian Muhammad Sharif would send awami suits and a pack of Butt sweets to 100 imams of Lahore’s mosques. He successfully managed cordial relations with two top rival Deobandi and Barelvi seminaries: Jamia Naeemia and Jamia Ashrafia. This deep relationship worked well even in this (NA-120) by-election as Jamia Ashrafia’s Asad Obaid, Hafiz Khalid Hassan and Jamia Naeemia’s Mufti Raghib Naeema worked day and night for Kulsoom’s victory. The Sharifs are a monolithic family with strong Barelvi thoughts – with the exception of Abbas Sharif who was Tablighi Deobandi and Hussain Nawaz Sharif who seems to have a tilt towards Saudi Ahle Hadith beliefs. All family members are religious, ritualistic and practising Muslims. Though Mian Nawaz Sharif is shifting his political ideology towards liberalism, the family is still dominated by the religious right ideology.In the times of the elder Mian Sharif, the family had diligently worked on the religious right. They had worked so smoothly in fact that the Shia Tehreek Nifaz Fiqah-e-Jafria had supported them in the 1997 elections. But after the Sharifs’ exile, the Shia community had other thoughts.The Shia community has been unhappy with the Sharifs since 2008 because of the perception that Shahbaz Sharif’s Punjab government had links with some anti-Shia sectarian organisations. Rumours of Malik Ishaq’s secret support of the provincial government and stories about Rana Sanaullah’s meetings with Maulana Ludhianvi and other militant leaders also created a perception of there being a tilt towards anti-Shia elements. On their part, the Sharifs didn’t bother much to fill this developing chasm because of their overconfidence. The majority of the Shias now follow Wahdatul Muslimeen whose leader Raja Nasir Abbas announced support for the PTI in the NA-120 by-election. Though the Sharifs are said to be Barelvis, their total disinterest in finding those involved in the Data Darbar blast infuriated the aggressive Barelvi ulema. That, coupled with the execution of Mumtaz Qadri, led to the Barelvi ulema openly revolting against the Sharifs. The TLP is the manifestation of the angry Sawad-e-Azam; its firebrand leader, Maulana Khadim Rizvi, is expressing the pent-up emotions of this school of thought. Khadim Rizvi, a proud Awan of Pindi’s Ghep District Chakwal was a prayer leader at the Pir Makki mosque Lahore but the pro- Mumtaz Qadri movement cost his job and he became a political volunteer of the cause and started openly challenging the Sharifs.In the last days of the by-election campaign, the Sharif camp realised the Barelvi anger and put Capt (r) Safdar, himself a staunch Barelvi and a supporter of Mumtaz Qadri, into the field to pacify the angry Barelvis. Safdar,,also an Awan from the Hazara division, clad in a rustic cotton shawl tried to look like an ordinary Hazara villager and delivered speeches in favour of Mumtaz Qadri but in the end begged for a vote for his mother in law.The case of the Ahl-e-Hadith school of thought is the most interesting. The Sharifs have gradually developed a strong allegiance to Maulana Sajid Mir and have made him senator as well. Sajid Mir is respected by his sect but the most popular among this sect is Hafiz Saeed, a UN-declared terrorist. Hafiz Saeed had been neutral in politics and focused all his energies on jihad in Kashmir. His supporters voted for the Sharifs in the past because of their rightist and religious stance but this time they revolted against them for their perceived pro-India leanings and anti-jihad narrative.A deeper study shows that the Milli Muslim League wants to get amnesty for Hafiz Saeed – like Afghan leader Gulbuddin Hikmatyar. The MML also has reservations against the Sharifs’ decision to register an FIR against those involved in the Pathankot incident. They had expected to be treated like Jaish-e-Muhammad leader Azhar Masood who has repeatedly been saved through Chinese vetoes in the UN on the behest of the Pakistani state. Hafiz Saeed’s Jamaatud Dawa has come into politics to be a mainstream force and as a pressure group to the other political parties. They are expecting to replace the Jamaat-e-Islami altogether and get a share from other national parties, including the N-League. They claim that their politics will be nonviolent and non-sectarian. One has to wait and see how truthful these claims are. Though the engineering of the religious right could not defeat the PML-N in the NA-120 by-election, it can pave the way for violent religious politics – which will be harmful for the state.

365,"In a previous article, ‘Can we avoid the IMF? (September 18, 2017), we had alerted about the impending crisis that may push the country back into an IMF programme. New data on Balance of Payments (BOP) for Jul-Aug further supports this view and underlines the need for immediate action. We present some suggestions to avert the crisis.Reducing fiscal deficit has to be the pivotal measure. For this, revenue collection (tax and non-tax) will have primacy compared to expenditure controls. While presenting the budget for FY2018, government claimed the deficit for FY2017 would be 4.1 percent, whereas the actual is 5.8 percent. Therefore, a prior adjustment in budgetary estimates, would be required to make them realistic. An added adjustment would be needed for revenue estimates since actual outcome was significantly below the revised budget for FY2018. It is likely that the fiscal deficit target for FY2018 is already out by 2.2 percent, which means against the target of 4.1 percent, the actual could be 6.3 percent.An adjustment of nearly 2.2 percent is an uphill task. On the revenue side, the Jul-Aug figures were on track and if this trend continues, the challenge would be to meet the non-tax revenue target. Last year, a fairly large number of one-off items (like sale of the security printing press to the SBP) were helpful. It is doubtful if similar help will be available this year. Also, gas cess collections (budgeted at Rs110 billion) will be a formidable challenge as last year collection was only Rs42 billion against the target of Rs142 billion.This leaves cutting expenditures as the only viable option to meet the deficit target. Things are tight on the current side as interest payments, defence and civil administration exhaust a lion’s share of current expenditures. Yet, austerity measures can still lead to significant results within these heads. A potential area of some savings, even of a temporary nature, is subsidies, transfers and contingent grants. Unfortunately, it is the development expenditure that has to take the big hit. With the exception of CPEC-related and other committed expenditures, every other development expenditure has to be put on hold until resource availability improves.Another susceptible provision in the budget is for provincial surplus of Rs347 billion (nearly 1.15 percent of GDP). Last year, against a targeted surplus of Rs300 billion, provinces incurred a deficit of Rs162 billion. Contingencies have to be built against the repeat performance of provinces.On the BOP side, things are getting tougher, as we continue to lose reserves in the face of rising current account deficit. During Jul-Aug, the deficit was around $2.5 billion, an increase of 100 percent over last year. At this rate, the deficit during the year could be around $15 billion, higher by nearly 25 percent over last year. As we said previously, we are not worried about the rising deficit since it indicates a growing economy. The July data on large-scale manufacturing shows a growth of 13 percent across a broad range of industries including iron & steel (46 percent), automobiles (43 percent), cement (38 percent) and engineering products (22 percent). This is the best growth in 11 years.The question is that of financing. If we plan to run down reserves any further, it would be tantamount to tearing down a building we have painstakingly constructed. Imports cannot be controlled through fiat. Doing so would violate our international commitments (convertibility of our currency on current account transactions) and throw back the economy to the days of import licensing. The only credible mechanism for balancing is the exchange rate adjustment. Four reforms would help alleviate BOP imbalance.One, except defence and debt servicing, all public-sector foreign exchange (Forex) needs should be met through the inter-bank market. Two, the SBP should not use reserves to defend the exchange rate, except to clear momentary disorder in the market; rather, it should purchase extra-liquidity even at slightly higher prices to build buffers against future instability. Three, Forex for capital goods (power projects etc) should not be provided; they should be financed through foreign credits. And, finally, an immediate ban should be imposed on the use of individual foreign currency accounts (FCAs) to be fed locally (dollarisation) and subsequent remittance abroad. FCAs fed by inward remittance from abroad can only be encashed in local currency or remitted abroad freely.The fourth year of the government also witnessed near abandonment of the reforms process, particularly in the areas of energy and privatisation. This poses a serious threat to fiscal sustainability and for an enabling environment for investment.The centrepiece of energy reforms was the debt settlement plan for public-sector entities (GENCOs/DISCOs) and suspension of any further accumulation of arrears in the system. As part of WB/ADB energy reforms programme, debts would have been settled through divestment of these entities to the private sector. In reality, not only do the arears continue to rise (Rs400 billion plus) but divestment plans have been shelved as well. The danger posed by the power sector to public finances is resurfacing. As media reports suggest, there is enough power available but finances for production are absent since arears are rising and liquidity shortages are becoming as acute as in 2013. Furthermore, significant tariff increases are being demanded by utilities, which is not acceptable to Nepra. This is a deeper challenge lurking in the background, which, if not fixed soon, could pose a serious challenge to macroeconomic stability.These suggestions would restore government’s credibility in economic management. It is a herculean task, especially for a prime minister in transition, yet without it much of what the government had gained earlier would be lost. The writer is a former finance secretary.

366,"Despite criticism on the picture used by Pakistani diplomat Maleeha Lodhi for highlighting the plight of Kashmiri pellet victims at the United Nations General Assembly, the issue of pellet gun usage in Kashmir is a grave humanitarian one for which a suitable answer is needed, Indian journalist Abhishek Saha writes for Hindustan Times.In his column, Saha points out that the use of the controversial weapon during 2016’s unrest “blinded and maimed thousands. Over a dozen persons were also killed. And the wounds caused by pellets are not only physical, they leave deep psychological scars and patients often slip into depression.”“Data from Kashmir’s hospitals show over 6,000 people – including children as young as four and teenaged girls – had suffered pellet injuries, with over 1,100 hit in the eyes. Amnesty International says at least 14 people were killed due to it in during the unrest,” he writes.“When a shotgun is being used on a crowd, it does not surprise us that it causes injuries such as we have seen. It is not meant for crowd control. It’s not used anywhere in the world. It’s not used anywhere in India either,” the head of Amnesty International in India, Aakar Patel, told Hindustan Times earlier this month. The human rights organisation has launched a campaign to seek an immediate ban on the weapon.Saha notes that home minister Rajnath Singh has previously asked security forces to refrain from using pellet guns against protesters, while chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has also, on several occasions, called for restraint on the usage of the weapon.The use of what is seen largely as an indiscriminate and disproportionate weapon need not be the answer in the face of violent stone-pelting protests, the journalist argues.In her address at UNGA, Maleeha Lodhi had called for an inquiry into the war crimes perpetrated by India in Occupied Kashmir (IoK), noting that forceful occupation of the troubled, conflict-ridden region is illegal.""Kashmir is not part of India,"" Lodhi had stressed, adding that the global community needs to collectively make India stop violating the ceasefire arrangement between the two countries."
367,"Authorities in Puerto Rico rushed Saturday to evacuate tens of thousands of people living downriver from a dam said to be in danger of collapsing because of flooding from Hurricane Maria.The drama unfolded as the US island territory, working without electricity, struggled to dig out and clean up from its disastrous brush with the hurricane, blamed for at least 33 deaths across the Caribbean.The 1920's era earthen dam on the Guajataca River in northwest Puerto Rico cracked on Friday, prompting the government to issue an order for 70,000 people in downstream towns to evacuate.The local office of the National Weather Service warned Friday evening of an ""imminent dam break.""A Puerto Rican government official who refused to be named confirmed Saturday that evacuations that began Friday evening were continuing.He said the dam had cracked under the weight of so much flooding, sending water gushing through and prompting fears of flash flooding.On Friday, public safety chief Hector Pesquera had cited a different cause for the initial dam failure, according to the newspaper El Vocero. Pesquera said a drain which normally releases water from the dam in a controlled fashion had broken, sending it gushing out in torrents.Puerto Rico was already battling dangerous floods elsewhere on the island because of Hurricane Maria, which hit before dawn Wednesday as part of its furious tear across the Caribbean.Governor Ricardo Rossello visited Isabela, an area near the dam, late Friday and urged people to get out. The government is also sending in buses to take people to higher ground.As the island is without power but for emergency generators, and without telecommunications, the governor's entourage left a satellite phone with the mayor of Isabela so he can talk to crews manning the dam.Rossello has called Maria the most devastating storm to hit the island in a century.So far, a preliminary assessment said 13 people had died as a result of the storm, he told CNN Friday.In its latest update at 1500 GMT, the US National Hurricane Center said Maria was moving northwest and located 320 miles (515 km) esat of Nassau in the Bahamas.So far, at least 33 people have been confirmed dead as a result of Hurricane Maria, including 15 in Dominica, three in Haiti and two in Guadeloupe.After speaking with Puerto Rico's governor on Thursday night, US President Donald Trump promised to speed up relief efforts.Of the 13 victims in Puerto Rico, eight died in the northern town of Toa Baja, one of the worst-hit areas which was ravaged by winds of more than 125 miles per hour (200 kilometers per hour) and then hit by flooding when the island's largest river, La Plata, burst its banks. The winds have eased a bit since then but not much.Many residents did not evacuate on time, while others say they never heard the warning sirens.Others could be seen returning home after several days away to begin the arduous process of clearing their homes of the heavy mud left by the floodwaters in order to start the process of rebuilding.Marisol Rosario, a 55-year-old housewife who fled with her husband, said the violent winds forced her to flee without taking their dog.""I thought I would find him dead, but he managed to climb on top of the furniture and survive,"" she said tearfully.Across the island, streets were littered with debris from the storm, with toppled trees, street signs and power cables strewn everywhere.The torrential rain also turned some roads into muddy brown rivers, impassable to all but the largest of vehicles.Puerto Rico's electricity network has been crippled by the storm and engineers say it could take months for power to be fully restored.US federal emergency chief Brock Long said ships carrying millions of meals and bottles of water were trying to dock as the island's ports are slowly reopened.Before reaching Puerto Rico, the storm devastaged the small island nation of Dominica.And after striking Puerto Rico, the storm headed west toward the Dominican Republic where it damaged nearly 5,000 homes, forcing the evacuation of more than 18,000 people, the president's office said."

369,"WASHINGTON: A US House of Representatives committee asked the White House on Monday for information about a media report that senior officials used private email accounts for government business.The request by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Oversight Committee follows a Politico report on Sunday that President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, and other current and former White House officials used private emails for their government duties.In a letter to the White House counsel, the committee’s chairman, Republican Trey Gowdy, and top Democrat Elijah Cummings said they would examine whether senior Trump administration officials were “deliberately trying to circumvent (federal) laws by using personal, private, or alias email addresses to conduct official government business.”Politico said the Kushner emails included correspondence about media coverage, event planning and other subjects. Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said his client complied with government record-keeping rules by forwarding all the emails to his official account.During Trump’s 2016 election campaign, the Republican attacked Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server for official correspondence when she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama.Some of Clinton’s messages were later determined to contain classified information.Politico said other senior Trump aides had also used private email accounts, including former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and economic adviser Gary Cohn.The New York Times reported on Monday that private accounts were also used by Trump’s daughter Ivanka after she became a White House adviser and by Stephen Miller, a senior Trump adviser.“All White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government related work. They are further instructed that if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement."

371,"ERBIL/SULAIMANIYA: Kurds voted in large numbers in an independence referendum in northern Iraq on Monday, ignoring pressure from Baghdad, threats from Turkey and Iran, and international warnings that the vote may ignite yet more regional conflict.The vote organised by Kurdish authorities is expected to deliver a comfortable “yes” for independence, but is not binding. However, it is designed to give Masoud Barzani, who heads the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), a mandate to negotiate the secession of the oil-producing region.Turnout among 5.2 million eligible voters was 78 percent, the Kurdish Rudaw TV station said, and vote counting had started. Final results are expected within 72 hours.Voters were asked to say yes or no to the question: “Do you want the Kurdistan Region and Kurdistani areas outside the (Kurdistan) Region to become an independent country?”For Iraqi Kurds - part of the largest ethnic group left stateless when the Ottoman empire collapsed a century ago - the referendum offered a historic opportunity despite intense international pressure to call it off.“We have seen worse, we have seen injustice, killings and blockades,” said Talat, waiting to vote in the regional capital of Erbil, as a group of smiling women, in colorful Kurdish dress, emerged from the school showing their fingers stained with ink, a sign that they cast their ballot.At Sheikh Amir village, near the Peshmerga front lines west of Erbil, long lines of Kurdish fighters waited to vote at a former school. Most emerged smiling, holding up ink-marked fingers.In the ethnically mixed city of Kirkuk, Kurds sang and danced as they flocked to polling stations.Opposition to the vote simmered among the Arabs and Turkmen who live alongside the Kurds in the northern Iraqi city and there were rumours that the vote would not take place in mixed areas. Officials later ordered an overnight curfew.Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered security services “to protect citizens being threatened and coerced” in the Kurdish region, after unconfirmed reports that Arabs in a small town in eastern Iraq were compelled to vote yes. Kurdish officials say no such coercion happened.The Kurds also say the vote acknowledges their contribution in confronting Daesh after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq.But with 30 million ethnic Kurds scattered across the region - mainly in Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Syria - Tehran and Ankara fear the spread of separatism to their own Kurdish populations."
372,"TORONTO: Chelsea Manning was turned back at the Canadian-US border because she was convicted of espionage for passing information to Wikileaks, the former US intelligence analyst said on Monday.Manning told Reuters via direct message on Twitter that she drove up to the Canadian border in Lacolle, Quebec, on Thursday evening, planning to vacation in Montreal and Vancouver.She said she was stopped at the border and detained overnight before being handed a report stating she was inadmissible “on grounds of serious criminality,” according to a picture of the report she posted online.The offences Manning was convicted of under the US Espionage Act “would equate to an indictable offence, namely Treason” if committed in Canada, the report reads.Manning said she was getting a Canadian lawyer and planned to challenge the finding of inadmissibility before a Canadian tribunal.A spokesman for Immigration and Refugee Minister Ahmed Hussen would not comment on the case, citing privacy concerns.“Each case is unique and assessed on its own merits,” Hursh Jaswal wrote in an email. “Our government is committed to ensuring that every case put forward ... is evaluated based on its merits and in a fair manner.

374,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan might have to pay a hefty fine of around Rs85 billion in the coming months as the country met an embarrassing outcome in several international litigations. The latest came when London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) directed Islamabad to pay Rs11 billion claimed by and independent power producers (IPP).The federal government has been heavily engaged in international arbitrations, where it has paid around Rs3 billion since 2013 to several law firms and lawyers.In several background meetings with senior officials associated with international arbitrations, this correspondent learnt that Pakistan has paid millions of dollars to around a dozen law firms and lawyers to plead cases, including those of Indian spy Kulbushan Jadhav, Karkey rental power plants’, Reko Diq mining, Kishanganga hydropower project, Progas LPG, Hubco Power, Sapphhire Electric and Halmore Energy. But not a single victory has been conceded by the hired legal teams so far. Another tribunal will start proceedings a case to determine the quantum of rest of the damages claimed by nine companies of the IPPs for which a hearing is scheduled for next month, a cabinet member told The News. “Claims’ amount may go up after a new quantum stage is set up,” he feared. The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded some US$700 million to Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim after a Turkish filed damage suit against Pakistan. The incumbent foreign affairs minister, Khawaja Asif, approached the Supreme Court against the contract awarded by the previous government to Karkey. Pakistan met another embarrassing situation when International Court of Justice ruled against Pakistan by putting stay on execution of Indian spy Kulbushan Jadhav. “Pakistan made a mistake in Jadhav’s case,” Justice (retd) Shaiq Usmani observed. ""It [Pakistan] has shot in its own feet. It’s Pakistan’s mistake to have appeared there. They shouldn't have attended [this proceeding].” Similarly, Islamabad and New Delhi failed to reach any agreement on the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) last week. Both neighbours held talks on this issue in Washington where Islamabad apparently could not convince the arbiters about its objections against the designs of Ratle and Kishenganga hydroelectric power projects in Indian-occupied Kashmir.“We need to settle with foreign investors in order to attract investments – recent embarrassments at international forums are alarming for us,” admitted a cabinet member, requesting anonymity. “Supreme Court’s orders in the Karkey case was perhaps disregarded by international forums –top court also need to be careful in commercial matters, particularly in our international commitments.”While shedding light on the reasons that led to this failure, the cabinet member said hesitation of various departments to develop a consensus on resolving the matter is responsible for this outcome. “The government generally engaged good legal teams but [even] the best ones cannot make up for lapses of their clients.” Ministries of water and power, and law and justice did not offer their comment on this development by saying, “reports pertaining to international arbitrations are not factually incorrect. We are consulting with our legal teams and respond accordingly.” Zahid Hamid, Minister for Law and Justice, also did not comment despite attempts. Another senior official associated with ministry of law and justice was of the view that the government did not avail its newly passed laws pertaining to ‘Mediation Act,’ which provides a window for setting up a panel of retired judges to resolve such issues. In IPPs and Karkey and several other cases, he recalled, international investors have repeatedly been requesting for settlement on win-win terms but traditional indemnity of civil servants remained a major stumbling block in the way of avoiding current billions of rupees loses to national exchequer. The official, who was not authorised to speak to media, said that civil servants have concerns that if they settle for lesser amount, then institutions like the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) will come after them. Therefore they hesitated and arbitration moved on resulting into adverse orders. Ahmer Bilal Soofi, ex-law minister (caretaker), maintained that it was necessary to contest all international cases fully, but there should be a strategy. “My experience is that in most of such cases, international investor is keen to talk to someone in the government and find a resolution even before filing claim. Officials remain reluctant to negotiate and settle for fear of subsequent NAB’s inquiry against them,” Mr Soofi, an authority on international laws told this correspondent. Further negotiation requires coordination and consensus of several ministries, provincial governments, PM Secretariat, etc, which takes enough time while arbitration processes move on and final orders or awards are issued, he added. That weakens bargaining power of the government, he said, adding, “It is important to recognise that all claimants are actually foreign investors and if we resolve and settle claims we encourage other foreign investors to invest in economic zones of Pakistan and that will also act as a positive balancing factor here.”"
375,"MILAN: Dutch designer Anouk Wipprecht has a vision for a world in which people stop telling themselves little lies about their emotions — and she believes high-tech fashion is the key.Her creations, which combine digital technology with haute couture, play with social norms and aim to engineer a cold-turkey solution to our dearest deceptions, she told AFP on the sidelines of Milan Fashion Week.The 32-year-old has already seen her stuff worn by former Black Eyed Peas star Fergie during a performance at American football extravaganza the Super Bowl. She has also created 3-D printed outfits for Canadian super troupe Cirque du Soleil.Yet one of her most deviously disruptive designs is a piece she is developing with crystal-maker Swarovski that uses built-in sensors to blink in time with the wearer's heartbeat.—Watch the video at the end of this storyIt sounds simple, and maybe even poetic to put one's vital force on display, but it also is incredibly revealing.Imagine wearing the thing while talking to a special someone you'd like to be more than just friends with or how about a job interview? They'll be able to see that your heart is pounding with fear or excitement.""It's sort of almost like you are having goosebumps, you cannot control it or you start to be red in your face. So in a really pure sense, you are able to broadcast your emotions,"" she said.""If you are wearing your heartbeat on your sleeve it is a really pure thing. It also gets you in a lot of really awkward situations that for me are super interesting.""This fascination with where human behaviour and digital couture meet has already led Wipprecht to conjure similarly striking experiments.One of the most famous is called, appropriately enough, the ""Spider Dress"". The 3-D printed garment is topped with a collar that is studded with robotic spider legs.The legs jump out — or ""attack"", as Wipprecht says — when someone moves too far into the wearer's personal space. Yet, after showing off the dress in Europe, China and the United States she has made some interesting discoveries.""People in the Netherlands, they go very fast, very close by, while in America they are more gentlemen... they stand further away."" she said.""I sometimes need to push people into the person's space a little bit... because they really have the notion of respect.""Her journey to a creator's life, lived mostly in New York and California's Silicon Valley, started early for Wipprecht.She was about 14 years old when she fell in love with fashion because it's ""expressive and you can communicate with it"" and began to study design. Then came her discovery of robotics.""For me, the robots had basically a brain and a heartbeat. That's what I wanted my fabrics and garments to have,"" she said.In the mid-2000s when she was still strapping big computers to the body, she discovered the so-called Arduino community.Named for a bar where its founders met in the northern Italian town of Ivrea, Arduino is an open-source computer hardware and software company.But it is also a collection of people who use its kits to build their own digital devices, like Wipprecht.She is optimistic that her work will one day lead to a ready-to-wear collection coming down the catwalk, but at the moment she is focused on pushing boundaries.""The things I do are out there to provoke and to be more experimental,"" she said. ""If we would all just make dresses that light up and change colour it would be super... boring."""
376,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim league-Nawaz (PML-N) will amend its manifesto to remove parts added by dictators, said Minister of State for Interior Affairs Talal Chaudhry on Monday. While talking on Geo News’ show Capital Talk, Talal said the clause which bars a disqualified minister from heading the party was added in their party manifesto by General (retd) Pervez Musharraf when he was in power. The party manifesto is said to be the “only hurdle” in former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s way to head the party as the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017 passed on September 22 paves the way for him to do so. When asked why members of Pakistan Peoples Party were absent from the assembly when the bill was being passed, party leader Sassi Palejo said the 37 votes would not have been possible had PPP not been active in the voting process. “It was us who had created the strength for these many number of votes.” About Nawaz’s return to the country despite knowing he could evade punishment during his absence, Talal said the former premier has returned to fulfil the promise he made to the people during his GT Road rally. However, he added, they were not sure on who had created the confusion of Nawaz intending not to return to Pakistan. “We have to date not been able to find out who leaks photos or matters pertaining to the Whatsapp call,” Talal said. As mentioned on the show, Nawaz’s decision to return to Pakistan was not sudden as he had informed the incumbent premier, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, about it earlier, on September 17. Even Federal Minister for Commerce Pervaiz Malik said on September 20 that Nawaz would return to the country to appear before the court. "
377,"MEXICO CITY: Mexico City’s infamous traffic jams were back on Monday as offices re-opened after last week’s deadly earthquake, but closed schools and clusters of homeless people served as reminders that life in the megalopolis has not yet returned to normal.The 7.1 quake on Sept. 19 killed at least 325 people and left thousands homeless, with many of them living in tents in the streets or emergency housing. Others among the 20 million people who live in greater Mexico City were gradually resuming their routines, however.“You can’t say that everything has totally returned back to being normal, but we do feel more safe that we did last week,” said market researcher Diego Sandoval, 27, back at work in an office in trendy Condesa, one of the worst hit areas of town, and lining up at a taco stand with a dozen other office workers and laborers.The most visible sign of the city coming back to life were the rush hour queues after a week of eerie quiet along the avenues and highways that criss-cross the capital, known for its gridlock.“We just opened up today, getting things back on track. We’ve been closed since the earthquake,” said Martha Bertha Martinez, 70, who along with her sister runs a small grocery store in Tlalpan, a southern neighbourhood.“Life goes on,” she said.More than 44,000 schools in six states were due to reopen on Monday, but only 103 in Mexico City, or barely 1 percent of its schools, were set to resume classes after they were certified as structurally safe.Officials said they did not want to impede relief efforts, so more than 4,000 public schools and nearly as many private schools in the capital will remain closed for now.The National Autonomous University of Mexico, with 350,000 students at campuses in and around Mexico City, resumed classes on Monday.Of 6,000 damaged buildings, some 1,500 have yet to be inspected, said Horacio Urbano, president of Centro Urbano, a think tank specializing in urban issues and real estate.Urbano said 10 percent of the damaged buildings were constructed after 1990, by which time strict building codes had been enacted in the wake of the 1985 earthquake that killed some 10,000 people.Search operations for quake survivors in Mexico City were narrowed to five buildings, using advanced audio equipment to look for signs of life beneath tons of rubble, with help from teams from as far afield as Israel and Japan.At a school in southern Mexico City where 19 children and six adults had previously been reported killed, officials recovered another body on Sunday, that of an adult women.The search for survivors and bodies also carried on at a ruined office building in the Roma neighbourhood and in a five-story apartment building in historic Tlalpan.Even with offices and businesses opening up again, it will take months or years for neighbourhoods like Condesa to recover emotionally and physically from the quake and aftershocks, with numerous residents packing up belongings and moving out.“Our neighbourhood is in mourning,” said Deborah Levy, 44, in Condesa. “Some neighbours and friends got together (Sunday). We went to eat to cheer ourselves up, looking for a little normality.”Florist Josue Castillo reopened the stall he has been tending for 15 years the day after the quake, “so people could see something pretty,” he said, between the ruins of buildings and cordoned off streets.But he said residents and businesses still did not feel safe in the area, which became the heart of Mexico City’s hip revival over the past decade.“People are leaving their homes and offices in Condesa. Leaving with their families. It was horrible yesterday to see people filling their cars with belongings and moving elsewhere out of fear of aftershocks,” he said."
378,"ROME: Italy’s soccer federation (FIGC) has fined Juventus, its most successful team, over an alleged scheme of giving tickets to hardcore fans to buy peace in the club’s terraces.FIGC had fined the club 300,000 euros (263,622.92 pounds) and given further fines and temporary bans to four of its executives including president Andrea Agnelli, it said in a statement on Monday.Juventus said it would appeal against the ruling. It denied wrongdoing and said it had always worked with police to ensure public safety and order.Investigators had been looking into whether the club gave tickets to fans known as ultras to avoid violence or racial abuse in the stands that might bring fines or docked points.Such a large number of tickets had been given out over such a long period of time that rules on contributing to fan clubs would have been violated, the FIGC court said, although there was insufficient proof that the recipients were touts or criminals.“It is no mystery that the entire management was committed to repairing relations with the ultras,” the ruling read.Agnelli, a scion of the family that owns carmaker Fiat Chrysler, said in May he met the ultras to make sure they did not feel discriminated against, and to avoid “problems of public order”.The FIGC’s court said Agnelli was not guilty of separate accusations that he knowingly met with a member of the powerful ‘Ndrangheta mafia group who was involved in the ticket scam.When he met alleged mobster Rocco Dominello -- who has denied any wrongdoing -- Agnelli was “totally unaware” of any illegality, the court wrote in its ruling.Agnelli, who is also the head of the European Club Association (ECA), is now suspended from his role at Juventus for a year and will have to pay a 20,000-euro penalty.The three other officials have been given the same fine and banned from their posts for up to one year and three months."
379,"KARACHI: Indian army chief General Bipin Rawat Monday termed the so-called surgical strikes a ""message"" to Pakistan, which he said could be repeated, according to India media.General Rawat, during his interaction with newsmen on Monday evening, said if the other side did not behave then the strikes would be repeated, the India Today reported.He added that apart from surgical strikes there were also other measures of counteraction.According to Indian media reports, Shankar questioned why Kejriwal wanted proof of surgical strikes, saying this was an insult to the Indian army.‘The Diplomat’ in a piece titled ‘Is India Capable of a Surgical Strike in Pakistan Controlled Kashmir?’ raised some serious questions about Indian military's capabilitiesOn September 29, India claimed to have conducted surgical strikes in Azad Kashmir, saying that several terrorists were killed in the military action conducted inside Pakistani territory.The claims were not only rebuffed by Pakistan and the international media, but they also prompted demands from some Indian political leaders for New Delhi to substantiate it with evidence.The Modi government drew criticism after the Pakistani military took a bus full of local and international journalists to the border area in order to show them the ground facts.Furthermore, the United Nations said its mission tasked with monitoring the ceasefire line between India and Pakistan ""has not directly observed"" any cross-border surgical strike as claimed by India.Indian military is not capable of conducting surgical strikes in the presence of Pakistan's missile system, states a report issued in a Japanese magazineThe UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) ""has not directly observed any firing across the LoC related to the latest incident,"" Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters days after the Indian claims.Having been failed to substantiate the claims, Indian Premier Narendra Modi later barred his party members from commenting on the matter."
380,"LOS ANGELES: LeBron James said Monday he did not regret branding President Donald Trump a ""bum"", accusing the US leader of dividing the nation in his feud with the sports world.NBA star James had taken aim at Trump on Twitter on Saturday after the president withdrew a White House invitation to the champion Golden State Warriors and star player Stephen Curry.""U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!"" James wrote.Asked if he regretted his choice of words on Monday, the Cleveland Cavaliers star gave a blunt response: ""No.""In a press conference at the Cavaliers' pre-season media day, James repeatedly referred to Trump as ""that guy"", saying he had failed to bring the country together.""We know this is the greatest country in the world, this is the land of the free,"" James said. ""But we still have problems just like everybody else. And when we have those problems, we have to figure out a way to come together and be as great as we can be as a people.""Because the people run this country. Not one individual — and damn sure, not him,"" James added, referring to Trump.James — the highest profile star in the NBA — said Trump's reaction to NFL players who protest during the national anthem showed he did not know how to lead the nation.""He doesn't understand the power that he has for being the leader of this beautiful country,"" James said.""He doesn't understand how many kids, no matter the race, look up to the President of the United States for guidance, for leadership, for words of encouragement.""He doesn't understand that. That's what makes me more sick than anything,"" added James, insisting that Trump had misunderstood the nature of the NFL protests, which were launched by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback to draw attention to racial injustice.""It's not about disrespect for the flag and military and people who served,"" he said.""It's about equality and having the option and freedom to speak about things they feel are unjust."""
381,"NEW YORK: North Korea's foreign minister on Monday accused US President Donald Trump of declaring war against his country and said Pyongyang was ready to defend itself by shooting down US bombers.The White House dismissed the claim as ""absurd"".The latest threats stoked a week-long war of words that began when the American leader threatened, in his first address to the United Nations General Assembly, to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it launches an attack.Alarm over Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs dominated this year's gathering of world leaders at the UN, amid fears the heated rhetoric could accidentally trigger a war.Those fears were further heightened after US bombers flew off the coast of North Korea on Saturday.Speaking to reporters outside his New York hotel, Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho responded to Trump, who had warned on Twitter at the weekend that North Korea ""won't be around much longer"" if it keeps up its threats.Ri said the international community had hoped that the ""war of words"" between the two countries would ""not turn into real actions.""""However, last weekend, Trump claimed our leadership would not be around much longer,"" Ri said. ""He declared a war on our country.""""Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to take counter-measures including the right to shoot down US strategic bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country,"" he said.""The question of who won't be around much longer will be answered then.""Ri noted that the statement from Trump was ""clearly a declaration of war"" even if it came from the US president. Under the US Constitution, Congress is the sole power that can declare war.The White House disputed the foreign minister's interpretation of Trump's sabre rattling.""We have not declared war against North Korea and frankly the suggestion of that is absurd,"" said White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders.In his UN address last week, Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea and derided leader Kim Jong-un as a ""rocket man"" who was ""on a suicide mission.""Kim hit back with a personal attack on Trump, branding him ""mentally deranged"" and a ""dotard"" and warning he would ""pay dearly"" for his threat.Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has compared the past week's rhetoric to a ""kindergarten fight between children"" and had urged the ""hot heads"" to calm down.Asked about the North Korean minister's latest remarks, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric acknowledged the dangerous spike in tensions, saying: ""When you have the rise of tension, the rise of rhetoric, so does the risk of miscalculation.""North Korea in recent weeks detonated its sixth nuclear bomb and has test-fired intercontinental missiles — saying it needs to defend itself against hostility from the United States and its allies.During his address to the General Assembly on Saturday, Ri launched a personal attack on Trump, calling him a ""mentally deranged person full of megalomania.""And just hours before Ri took the UN podium, US bombers flew off the east coast of North Korea, the furthest north of the demilitarized zone that any US aircraft has flown this century.The Pentagon described the mission as a ""demonstration of US resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat.""A Pentagon spokesman stressed on Monday that the bombers flew in international airspace. ""So we have the right to fly, sail and operate and we are legal permissible around the globe,"" he said.On Saturday, Ri warned that Trump's threat to destroy North Korea made ""our rockets' visit to the entire US mainland all the more inevitable.The bellicose rhetoric comes as international alarm mounts over Pyongyang's weapons ambitions — including a suggestion by Ri last week that the country is considering detonating an H-bomb over the Pacific.US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has said such a move would be a ""shocking display of irresponsibility.""As tensions over North Korea reached fever-pitch, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called a snap election.The North Korea crisis appears to have given the hawkish Abe a welcome boost in the polls following a series of scandals."

383,"KARACHI: The management of Pakistan Super League (PSL) is in discussion with franchise owners to prepone the proposed date for players draft ahead of the third edition of the T20 league.The draft for the PSL third edition is tentatively scheduled to be held in Lahore on November 10, but the date is now likely to be pulled earlier by couple of weeks.“Two franchises have suggested that they’ll be busy in November for South Africa’s T20 Global League so the dates for players draft should be brought earlier,” said a source privy to the matter. “A final date and procedure for players draft is likely to be announced this week,” the source added.Two PSL franchises, Lahore Qalandars and Peshawar Zalmis, have also bought franchises in South Africa’s T20 Global League which starts on November 3. Meanwhile, the franchises are in final phase of retaining and releasing players. The cut-off date given to the teams by PSL management is October 5 to submit the names of players they intend to retain for the next edition. “Players released by the franchises will go back to draft,” the source said.“Multan Sultan will pick 9 or 10 players, number is yet to be decided before the draft and Multan’s pre-draft picks will be from the players released by the other franchises,” it added.All the franchises are told to release players from all the categories to provide Multan Sultans a level playing field."
384,"Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has said the club cannot afford to ignore any competition unlike rival managers who have questioned the value of the League Cup.Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho suggested scrapping of the League Cup could help avoid fixture congestion and would help English clubs become more competitive in European competitions.The Portuguese manager was also backed by Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola, who played down the significance of the League Cup.Wenger’s Arsenal, who finished fifth in the Premier League last season, missed out on Champions League qualification for the first time in 20 years and are playing in the less prestigious Europa League.“You cannot sacrifice deliberately any competition with the pressure that every club is under now,” Wenger told reporters ahead of Arsenal’s home match against West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Monday.”You know that you could pay the price sometimes for it because you know that if you go further in the League Cup, at some stage you play in the semi-final – home and away in January.“(So) you have the FA Cup, the Premier League and sometimes you lose players in these competitions.”Wenger is set to face left back Kieran Gibbs, who returns with West Brom at the Emirates for the first time since leaving Arsenal in the transfer window.When asked if Gibbs’ transfer move felt like losing a family member, Wenger replied: ”Of course. And I believe that for (players that leave) it must be difficult to make that step as well.“He did not ask to leave, it was a mutual decision. He wanted to play - he’s 27, or 28. You want to play at that age.”The Frenchman also admitted it was also difficult to sell midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Liverpool.The 24-year-old England international has since struggled to make a breakthrough at Anfield, starting only once since joining the Merseyside club last month.”Of course I sympathise with (Oxlade-Chamberlain), with everybody,“ Wenger said. ”But we’re in a job where you have to accept that you are judged every day on your performances.“But the level of your performances is not permanent. It’s down to you to respond to that.”Following their league assignment, Arsenal visit Belarusian side BATE Borisov in Europa League on Thursday."

Everyone’s waiting with a cringe on their face,” said Jason Ware, chief investment officer at Albion Financial in Salt Lake City.“We don’t want this to continue, to become a war of words, and then who knows when a mistake can happen... and there’s a lot of that chatter going on trading desks.”The White House spokeswoman said at a press briefing that the United States had not declared war on North Korea, adding that to suggest that is “absurd.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.5 points, or 0.24 percent, to 22,296.09, the S&P 500 lost 5.56 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,496.66 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 56.33 points, or 0.88 percent, to 6,370.59.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.23 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.39 percent.A stronger US dollar weighed on emerging market stocks .MSCIEF, which lost 1.27 percent, the most in over four months.

387,"PARIS: Botanical gardens are a Noah's Ark for endangered plants, collectively safeguarding four out of 10 species known to face extinction, researchers said Monday.But the otherwise reassuring number hides a serious imbalance, they reported in the science journal Nature Plants.Such gardens — which often double as research centres — house only a quarter of tropical flora, as opposed to 60 percent of plants native to temperate climes.Species diversity is far richer in the tropics, but more than 90 percent of vegetal safe havens are in the northern hemisphere.Plants are essential for life on Earth. They play a crucial role in regulating the climate, maintaining soil fertility, and the purification of water and air.They also provide food, medicines, building materials, and fuel to sustain human life.And yet more than a fifth of wild plant diversity is threatened with extinction, earlier research has shown.The biggest threat is humanity's expanding ""footprint"", already encroaching on three-quarters of all land area — 40 percent of which has been given over to agriculture.""The global network of botanical gardens is our best hope for saving some of the world's most endangered plants,"" said senior author Samuel Brockington, a researcher at the University of Cambridge in England.""If we fail to conserve our plant diversity, humanity will struggle to solve the global challenges of food and fuel security, environmental degradation, and climate change.""To find out what percentage of plant species are housed in captivity, Brockington and colleagues compared databases cataloguing all known flora to those held by a third of the world's 3,269 botanical gardens.More than a third of Earth's 350,699 known plant species are to be found in at least one such institution, the scientists reported.Botanical gardens also house more than 40 percent of the nearly 32,000 plant species classified as threatened on the Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) ThreatSearch database.It is by far the world's most comprehensive list of threatened flora.The researchers showed that only 10 percent of the area in botanical gardens is given over to these endangered plants.They also revealed that Earth's most ancient living flora, so-called non-vascular plants such as mosses and some algae, have been overlooked and neglected, comprising less than five percent of species under care.""Non-vascular species are the living representations of the first plants to colonise land,"" Brockington said. ""They are essential for understanding the evolution of plants.""Scientists have so far assessed the threat status of about 26 percent of the world's known plant species."
388,"KARACHI: Ramiz Raja — the ex-captain of Pakistani cricket team — believes the upcoming series with Sri Lanka offers a decent opportunity to test possible replacements for retired legends Younis Khan and Misbah ul Haq.Pakistan will take on Sri Lanka in a two-match series — its first following the retirement of the experienced batting duo MisYou.Talking to Geo.tv here on Monday, the 'Cricket ka Raja' feels Sri Lanka has a comparatively weaker side, which, in turn, would provide Pakistan with the opportunity to test the young legs without any fear or pressure.“Sri Lanka is going through a bad patch. They were defeated by Zimbabwe in a couple of matches at home and wrecked by India in a recent series,"" Raja commented.The ace commentator went on to explain that Pakistan should opt for a charged tactic to ""attack Sri Lanka aggressively and should not allow them to settle in any session”.However, “Pakistan must not be complacent either; [players] need to work hard like they do against any other team to get twenty wickets in a match,” Raja elaborated in an exclusive conversation with this correspondent.Leading the team in the Test matches will likely pose a challenge for Sarfraz Ahmed — the incumbent team captain, Ramiz stated, adding that he hoped the wicket-keeper will continue to learn and transform his leadership skills into the longer format of the game.“Test cricket is different from limited-overs type [wherein] you have a set formula to use your players. On the other hand, in Test cricket, you need to go session-by-session and there are often periods where you just need to stay calm,” Raja noted.“Sarfraz has redefined Pakistan in limited-overs cricket and helped it look in good shape. I hope he will, with time, bring the same to Pakistan’s Test cricket.""Offering words of support, the former skipper added, ""All he needs is to remain positive and lead his team with an aggressive approach.""In response to another question, Raja said it may not be easy for Pakistan to find a replacement for Misbah and Younis, adding that doing so is not something that can be done ""overnight"".“Players, who are technically good and can stay on the wicket, should be identified and then prepared as the replacement of the duo,” Raja concluded."
389,"LONDON: The central character of the Memogate controversy made an appearance after a silence of many years at one of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s event in Washington – and Hussain Haqqani was in Geneva at the same time for the current United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) session.When approached for his comments, Haqqani said: ""Memogate was just media noise, which is why the case has never been decided by the Supreme Court. That it disrupted lives without a conclusion is a sad reflection on how things work in Pakistan. I have moved on"".“I did nothing wrong, never went into hiding, and have always expressed my opinions publicly. In Geneva, I spoke as a Pakistani to seek justice for many of those who have been alienated from Pakistan so that more tragedies are averted.""Mansoor Ijaz, who was at the heart of the Memogate scandal which rocked the civilian government of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in 2012, can be seen in the audience at the discussion at Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) where PM Abbasi answered questions of the audience.Exactly when Mansoor Ijaz appeared in Washington DC, his former friend and Pakistan’s then ambassador to Washington Hussain Haqqani was in Geneva, Switzerland’s capital, meeting delegates to the current United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) addressing a seminar on Balochistan, organised by a nationalist group.Members of Pakistan’s delegation, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, journalists and local Pakistan-watchers can also be seen in the audience.More than half an hour to into the question and answer session, Mansoor Ijaz asked the prime minister a question about Pakistan’s nuclear programme and fears expressed about the programme often in the western press.The premier was also asked a question about the plutonium waste and what measures the country was taking for its safety.Prime Minister Abbasi replied that Pakistan’s nuclear assets were completely safe and Pakistan was a responsible nuclear country which has managed nuclear assets for well over 50 years without any problem.Mansoor Ijaz came to light in October 2011 when he made allegations that he was asked by Hussain Haqqani to help him prevent a possible military coup in Pakistan in the wake of Osama bin Laden’s killing. He wrote an article about the memorandum in a piece for the Financial Times.Ijaz claimed that Haqqani wrote the memo on behest of Asif Ali Zardari but Haqqani denied the claim. The Supreme Court of Pakistan set up a commission to investigate the matter and it is understood that then ISI’s chief Ahmed Shuja Pasha met Ijaz in London and later told the SC that after examining Ijaz's Blackberry phone records, he was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an inquiry.Mansoor Ijaz told this scribe that he asked Pakistan PM question on nuclear concerns to put concerns to rest. ""My question was aimed at giving the prime minister a chance to alleviate concerns that Pakistan's fissile materials like plutonium waste could ever fall into the wrong hands. In my view, this concern has been overhyped for years by western journalists - even I was guilty of doing this in some of my op-ed pieces in the 2000s after the 9/11 attacks. But my opinion changed over the years, and Pakistan's long track record of safely building its nuclear assets from the 1960s onward through every possible type of political and military turmoil is demonstrable evidence of the safeguards inbuilt in Pakistan's nuclear program.”"

They are also working with North Korea.""Ghasemi said there were ""no similarities nor resemblance"" with the actions of North Korea, and that claims they were working together on ballistic missile development amounted to a ""clear lie"".""It is very clear that this is a nonsense and baseless claim,"" he told reporters.Iran said on Saturday that it had tested its Khorramshahr missile with a range of 2,000 kilometres .The indigenously-built Khorramshahr was first announced by the defence ministry in September 2016, and US officials said it was this ballistic missile was tested in January, sparking international condemnation.However, Iran never confirmed that the January test was the Khorramshahr missile.There has been speculation, particularly from hawks in Washington, that the Khorramshahr was based on North Korea´s intermediate-range Musudan missile.In 2010, a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks showed that US intelligence officers believed North Korea had shipped Musudan missiles to Iran.But analysts say the differing ranges cast doubt on those concerns.A detailed report earlier this year by the US-Korea Institute at John Hopkins University in the United States found: ""The available evidence cannot verify speculation that the Iranian missile is similar to North Korea´s Musudan"".Iran and North Korea have cooperated on military technology in the past.During Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s, it turned to North Korea as one of the only sources of military assistance, importing a stockpile of Nodong missiles.Iran used the Nodong to develop its own medium-range Shahab-3 missile, first tested in 1998, and it has continued to improve on the design since.But there has been scant evidence of direct cooperation between the two countries in recent years, with Iran seemingly keen to distance itself from the East Asian pariah state.Instead, Iran has emphasised its home-grown missile programme, and denied that this breaches any international laws.""Since the criticism of American officials, the speed of missile development has increased several times,"" said General Amir Ali Hadjizadeh, head of aerospace forces for the Iran´s elite Revolutionary Guards, according to state television on Monday.""All the material and pieces for our missiles are manufactured locally and do not come from abroad,"" he said.He said the Khorramshahr missile was 13 metres (43 feet) long and could carry a 1,800 kilogram payload."
392,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Monday reserved its verdict in the contempt of court case against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, which will be announced on September 27.A four-member ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Justice (retd) Sardar Raza Khan, resumed hearing of the contempt case against the PTI chief on Monday.The PTI chief, in his reply submitted through his lawyer Babar Awan, stated that ""I respect the ECP and believe in the supremacy of institutions.""Khan stated that he confirms the apology tendered by his previous counsel, Saqlain Haider, regarding the ""contemptuous"" remarks, adding that the contempt of court matter is a ""closed transaction belonging to the past.""""The issue originated from non-submission of documents in the party funding case, however, the documents have been submitted to the ECP,"" the PTI chief stated, requesting the ECP to withdraw the show cause notice issued on September 24.His counsel, Babar Awan, pleaded the ECP to now dismiss contempt proceedings against his client.However, petitioner Akbar Babar's counsel objected saying Imran did not apologise to the court despite 13 chances given to him.Babar's counsel then submitted a fresh contempt petition in the ECP, stating that the PTI chief, in a press talk in Karachi on September 20, cast aspersions against the ECP impartiality.The ECP directed the PTI chief to submit his response with regards to the fresh petition by Akbar Babar. The verdict reserved in the case will also be announced on the same day.ECP has given the PTI chief until 8th May to submit his responseThe ECP further stated that it would make clear its next course of action after perusing the PTI chairman's reply.Later, addressing the media, Awan and PTI leader Naeemul Haque said former premier Nawaz Sharif wants a clash of state institutions in the country. They claimed that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is a puppet, as the real strings are still being pulled by Nawaz. At the last hearing on September 14, the ECP had issued bailable warrants against Imran to ensure his presence in the case.However, the PTI approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the issuance of warrants. The IHC, on September 20, suspended the bailable arrest warrants. Hearing the case, Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a three-member larger bench, directed the PTI chief to reply to the ECP's show-cause notice.Awan assured the court that the PTI chairman would reply to the ECP's show-cause notice with regards to contempt proceedings against him.The IHC then adjourned the hearing until September 26.The ECP had ordered Imran to submit a surety bond of Rs100,000 until September 25 and nominate two persons who would ensure payment of the amount and be held responsible otherwise.IHC sends notices to Akbar S Babar, ECP to submit replies by Sept 7Imran was also ordered to appear on that day in the commission in person.Earlier, on September 14, during the hearing of contempt proceedings, Awan had argued before the ECP that proceedings against his client should be postponed until the matter is decided by the high court.The ECP had summoned Imran in person on that as well but he failed to do so.The ECP had issued the contempt notice to Khan on January 24 over his “scandalous remarks” about the commission.Akbar Babar, the petitioner who had filed the foreign funding case against the PTI leadership, had informed the ECP that the PTI chief had accused it of being biased in the foreign funding case following which his counsel tendered an apology with the commission."

405,"DUBAI: Dubai staged a test flight on Monday for what it said would soon be the world’s first drone taxi service under an ambitious plan by the United Arab Emirates city to lead the Arab world in innovation.The flying taxi developed by German drone firm Volocopter resembles a small, two-seater helicopter cabin topped by a wide hoop studded with 18 propellers.It was unmanned for its maiden test run in a ceremony arranged for Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed.Meant to fly without remote control guidance and with a maximum flight duration of 30 minutes, it comes with plenty of fail-safes in case of trouble: back-up batteries, rotors and, for a worst case scenario, a couple of parachutes.Volocopter is in a race with more than a dozen well-funded European and US firms, each with its own science fiction-inspired vision for creating a new form of urban transport that is a cross between a driverless electric car and a short-haul, vertical takeoff-and-landing aircraft.These include aerospace giant Airbus, which aims to put a self-piloting taxi in the air by 2020; Kitty Hawk, a company backed by Google co-founder Larry Page; and Uber, which is working with partners on its own flying taxi strategy.“Implementation would see you using your smartphone, having an app, and ordering a Volocopter to the next voloport near you. The volocopter would come and autonomously pick you up and take you to your destination,” CEO Florian Reuter said.“It already is capable of flying based on GPS tracks today, and we will implement full sense capability, also dealing with unknown obstacles on the way,” he added, saying developers aimed to initiate the taxis within five years.In Monday’s test flight, the device hovered upward about 200 meters and whirred for about five minutes over a windswept patch of sand astride the emirate’s Gulf coast.Attired in crisp white robes and headdresses, Sheikh Hamdan and his entourage clapped approvingly from a nearby viewing deck as the craft alighted.The UAE has sought to distinguish itself in a region mired in war and strife as a high-tech, forward-looking society.It plans to send an unmanned probe to Mars by 2021, the Arab world’s first mission to space, and Dubai has in many ways led their showy march into the future by introducing the region’s first driverless metro and robot policemen prototypes.“Encouraging innovation and adopting the latest technologies contributes not only to the country‘s development but also builds bridges into the future,” Sheikh Hamdan said in a statement."
406,"A sophisticated hack has targeted one of the world’s “big four” accountancy firms – Deloitte – it surfaced. Confidential emails and plans of some of the company’s blue-chip clients were compromised in the attack.The cyber-security attack went unnoticed for months, the Guardian reported.Deloitte – one of the largest private firms in the US – provides auditing, tax consultancy, and high-end cyber-security advice to some of the world’s biggest banks, multinational companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms, and government agencies.Deloitte clients across all of these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The companies include household names as well as US government departments.So far, six of Deloitte’s clients have been told their information was “impacted” by the hack. An internal review of the incident is underway.According to The Guardian, Deloitte discovered the hack in March this year, but the attackers may have had access to its systems since October or November 2016.The hacker’s obtained privileged, unrestricted “access to all areas” after the firm’s global email server was compromised through an “administrator’s account.” The account required only a single password and did not have “two-step” verification, sources said.Emails to and from Deloitte’s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service, which was provided by Microsoft. In addition to emails, the hackers had potential access to usernames, passwords, IP addresses, architectural diagrams for businesses and health information, with some emails having attachments with sensitive security and design details.The breach is believed to have been US-focused and was regarded as so sensitive that only a handful of Deloitte’s most senior partners and lawyers were informed.It has yet to establish whether a lone wolf, business rivals or state-sponsored hackers were responsible."
407,"TOKYO: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday called a snap election, seeking a fresh term at the helm of the world's third-largest economy as tensions with nearby North Korea reach fever-pitch.Abe hopes to capitalise on a weak and fractured opposition to sweep back into power, as polls show him regaining ground after a series of scandals.""I will dissolve the House of Representatives on the 28th"" of September, Abe told reporters, a precursor to a general election. The prime minister did not give a date for the election but it will reportedly be on October 22.Surveys suggest voters approve of the hardline stance taken by the nationalist Abe on North Korea, which fired two missiles over the country in the space of a month and has threatened to ""sink"" Japan.According to a weekend poll in business daily Nikkei, 44 percent of voters plan to vote for Abe's conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), while only eight percent favoured the main opposition Democratic Party.Nevertheless, one fifth of those polled said they were still undecided, potentially opening the door for gains by a new party formed by allies of the popular mayor of Tokyo Yuriko Koike, which will field dozens of candidates.Koike's Tomin First no Kai (Tokyo Residents First) party humiliated Abe and the LDP in local elections in July, but analysts say the new grouping has not had time to lay a national foundation to mount a serious challenge to the prime minister.In an apparent bid to steal Abe's limelight, Koike went before the cameras just hours before his announcement to announce she was creating a national political party called ""Kibo no To"" (Party of Hope).""Japan is facing a difficult time considering the situation in North Korea. Economically, the world is making a big move while Japan's presence is gradually declining,"" said Koike.""Can we continue letting (the existing lawmakers) handle politics?""But Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Japan, said there was ""no opposition worthy of the name in Japan"".""The LDP is a giant among dwarves. It would take a major scandal to derail the Abe express,"" said the analyst.The winner of the expected snap election faces a daunting in-tray of challenges ranging from an unprecedented crisis with North Korea to reviving the once world-beating Japanese economy.In addition to threats to destroy Japan, Pyongyang has fired two missiles over the northern island of Hokkaido in the space of less than a month.However, the North Korea crisis appears to have given the hawkish Abe a welcome boost in the polls following a series of scandals, including allegations he improperly favoured a friend in a business deal.Despite a recent run of growth, the election winner will also have to contend with a sluggish economy, as the heavily indebted country grapples with a low birth rate and a shrinking labour force.Although Abe is expected to triumph in the vote, there are question marks over whether he will retain a two-thirds parliamentary majority needed to reform the constitution to strengthen Japan's military, one of his stated priorities.""Despite the seemingly favourable backdrop for Abe, there are risks in calling a snap election,"" said Yoel Sano, an analyst at BMI research.At a time of national crisis over North Korea, Japanese voters may see it as a ""cynical and opportunistic move"" designed to divert attention from scandals that weighed on Abe's popularity, warned Sano.Commentator Masao Yora said the election would ""create a political vacuum"" just when the country needs strong leadership in the face of the threat from Pyongyang.This ""may seem normal in Japan but from abroad, it is difficult to understand"", Yora told AFP.If re-elected, it would be Abe's fourth term.Abe, the third generation of a powerful political family, appeared to be groomed for power from an early age. He was the country's youngest prime minister when he first won the top job.Abe was the first world leader to cultivate close relations with US President Donald Trump, meeting the tycoon in Trump Tower even before he was inaugurated."

About 40 commandos raided a room at the Royal Garden Home Hotel in Soi Nana and arrested Abdul Rehman alias Bhola, 46, who was staying alone in the room. The Federal Investigation Agency brought Abdul Rahman alias Bhola to Karachi from Bangkok later on."

The second was on March 22 and killed at least 44 people including 14 children at the Tabqa market and bakery.The US-led coalition has been carrying out air strikes in support of anti-Daesh operations in Syria since September 2014, after expanding its existing campaign in neighbouring Iraq.Since last November, it has been supporting the Kurdish-Arab alliance known as the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) as it battles to capture Raqa province, including its capital Raqa city.The SDF broke into Raqa city in June and is on the verge of capturing the former jihadist bastion.But activists have criticised what they say are disproportionately high civilian death tolls in the campaign.The coalition says it take all possible precautions to avoid civilian casualties and investigates credible reports of civilian deaths in its strikes.In August, it acknowledged the deaths of 624 civilians in its strikes in Syria and Iraq since 2014.But rights groups say the real figure is much higher, and HRW criticised the coalition's methodology for assessing civilian casualties.It said the coalition reported having assessed the Mansourah and Tabqa strikes, but it appeared they carried out no site visits nor witness interviews even though both places have been under SDF control for weeks.""If the coalition had visited the sites and talked to witnesses they would have found plenty of evidence that civilians were killed in these attacks,"" Solvang said.""The coalition should follow our lead, conduct full investigations, and find ways to make its civilian casualty assessments more accurate.""More than 330,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011."

420,"YANGON: Searchers on Monday found 17 more bodies in mass graves in Myanmar´s Rakhine state, the government said, a day after the bodies of 28 Hindu villagers were exhumed in what the army says is evidence of a massacre by Muslim Rohingya militants.Northern Rakhine has been ravaged by communal violence since Rohingya insurgents staged deadly raids on police posts on August 25, unleashing an army crackdown that has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians.The vast majority - more than 430,000 - are Rohingya Muslims who have fled across the border to Bangladesh from a military campaign which the UN says likely amounts to ethnic cleansing.But tens of thousands of ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, and the region´s small population of Hindus, have also bolted from their homes, saying they were attacked by Rohingya militants.On Sunday the army said it had discovered two mud pits filled with 28 Hindu corpses - mostly women and children - outside the village of Ye Baw Kyaw in northern Rakhine.The military blamed the killings on Rohingya ""extremist terrorists"".Seventeen more bodies were found on Monday, said government spokesman Zaw Htay.Ni Maul, a Hindu leader who joined the search alongside soldiers and police, said the new corpses were of Hindu men aged between 30-50 and buried in two pits near the other grave sites.""We are still searching together with soldiers and police as we believe more than 100 people were killed at that time,"" he told AFP.Displaced Hindus from that area, known as Kha Maung Seik, have told AFP that Rohingya fighters stormed into their communities on August 25, killing many and taking others into the forest.They showed AFP a list of 102 people from two villages - Ye Baw Kyaw and Taung Ywar - who are feared dead by distraught relatives now sheltering in camps.Several Hindu women were also abducted by the militants, according to the displaced Hindus, who wept as they recounted the bloodshed.With the government blocking access to the conflict zone, it is difficult to verify the range of accusations that have intensified ethnic hatreds in Rakhine.But the army has steadfastly blamed violence on the Rohingya -- a Muslim minority it has been trying for years to eject from Myanmar -- while highlighting the suffering of other ethnic groups swept up in the violence.The focal point of the unrest, northern Rakhine´s Maungdaw district, was once home to a fragile mosaic of religious communities, dominated by the Rohingya.But vast swathes of the border region are now completely emptied of Muslim residents, with nearly 40 percent of Rohingya villages abandoned in under a month.Frightened and dispossessed ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and Hindus, who have largely fled south, say they see no future alongside their former Muslim neighbours.""I do not dare go back to the village,"" said Kyaw Kyaw Naing, one of the hundreds of displaced Hindus sheltering in a derelict football stadium in Rakhine´s state capital Sittwe.""We still do not know yet how many of those dead bodies include relatives from our camp,"" added the 34-year-old, whose Hindu name is Shu Bown.In Bangladesh, relief agencies are struggling to meet the vast needs of the Rohingya cramming into shanties in Cox's Bazar, an influx the UN has described as the ""fastest and most urgent refugee emergency in the world"".Yet there is little sympathy for the Muslim minority inside Myanmar, where Islamophobia has been stewing for years among the overwhelmingly Buddhist population.Even before the latest eruption of violence, the 1.1 million-strong Rohingya were relegated to precarious and impoverished lives, with hundreds of thousands trapped in refugee camps following previous persecution.Those outside the camps were subject to laws that stripped them of citizenship and severely restricted their movements and access to jobs, schooling, and healthcare.Analysts say the repression helped give rise to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, whose raids plunged the region into crisis. "

425,"KARACHI: Addressing the third majlis of Muharram at Taheri Masjid here on Sunday, Dawoodi Bohra community’s spiritual leader Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin said that Almighty Allah chose Islam for showing the right path to mankind through our beloved Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).He added that Islam is the religion of peace and tranquillity, adding that providing service and welfare to human beings is equivalent to making Allah Almighty happy. “The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) and Ahle Bait rendered great sacrifices for spreading the message of peace,” he said.The spiritual leader said: “Particularly, the grandson of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA), who was hungry and thirsty for three days, had fought on the hot sand of Karbala against the tormentors and laid his precious life in the way of Almighty Allah.” He further added that the exemplary sacrifices made by Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his people had become a lifetime example in the history of humankind.Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin thanked the Government of Pakistan, people of Pakistan and the people in power for making high-level security arrangements for the majlis. He also thanked the prime minister and interior minister for making this visit possible and for coordinating and cooperating during the entire process.The spiritual leader said that this was the love of Pakistani people and the government that was leading towards enhanced mutual ties.

He thanked the administration for adopting strict security measures and giving other facilities to participants of the Muharram congregations.On the other hand, Sindh Governor Mohammad Zubair said that the arrival and stay of the spiritual leader of Dawoodi Bohra community, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, in Karachi during the sacred month of Muharram shows an improvement in law and order of the city.The Sindh governor stated this on Sunday as he met the spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community here at the Taheri Masjid, Saddar.

He said the Dawoodi Bohra community had always played an important role in promotion of economic and trade activities in Karachi, which is rightly considered as the business hub of the country.The Sindh governor said that the development of Karachi meant the development of the entire country as the city offered massive prospects of trade and investment after restoration of law and order here.Speaking to the media on the occasion, the Sindh governor said that stringent security measures had been put in place during the sacred month of Muharram in order to thwart any untoward incident. He said that concerned citizens were required to extend cooperation to the government for maintaining law and order as peace could not be ensured without the support of public. He said that Ulema of all sects had complete consensus of opinion that beliefs and teachings of each others’ sect should be given due respect and honour.Governor Zubair said that teachings of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) were for the entire world as the maternal grandson of the Last Prophet (SAW) had laid down his life and that of his companions for upholding the flag of Islam as after this noble sacrifice, Islam had become an exemplary religion for the entire world.Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said that he had invited the spiritual leader of Dawoodi Bohra community, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, to spend Muharram in the city and address his majalis and he had kindly consented to his request.He said this while talking to the media just after listening to the majlis of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin at Taheri Masjid Saddar.He said that it was an event where Syedna was addressing the majlis of his community in the city in which his followers had come from other countries also. “We have made necessary security arrangements for his majlis,” he said. “Our Bohri brothers were peaceful and cooperative; they have also cooperated with the administration for their security.”Syed Murad Ali Shah said that peace has been restored in the city with constant efforts and political will of the government. “This credit goes to the people of Karachi who supported the targeted operation and also extended their full support to the government, Rangers, police and other law enforcement agencies in restoring peace,” he said.The chief minister said that with the restoration of peace in the city, a boost had been witnessed in the business activities. “People, with their families, have been coming out of their homes for outings without any fear,” he said. “Syedna has come from India to address his majalis and this is happening after 21 years.”The Sindh chief minister expressed his satisfaction that the city is again attracting and respecting its visitors, guests, investors and religious scholars and spiritual leaders.Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, just after his address, presented a shawl, rosary and a prayer mat to the chief minister.Later, the chief minister reviewed the arrangements for the Dawoodi Bohra community’s other majlis at the KPI ground. He visited their kitchen, dispensary and sitting places. The chief minister issued directives to Additional IG Karachi Mushtaq Mahar and Commissioner Karachi Aijaz Ali Khan to keep in touch with the management of the Bohra Jamaat majalis and other programmes and provide them necessary security, support, and whatever else was required by them.Mayor Karachi Wasim Akhtar and MQM-Pakistan chief Dr Farooq Sattar also paid a visit to the Taheri Masjid in Saddar on Sunday where they met with Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin — the 53rd spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community and expressed well wishes on his visit to Pakistan.Talking to media representatives on this occasion, Dr Farooq Sattar stressed the need for promoting Ittehad Bain-ul-Muslimeen, which he said was the need of the hour. He said the arrival of Dr Mufaddal Saifuddin was in fact a message of love and unity and all of their people work for peace and harmony around the world.He said in the month of Muharram, we all should show the mutual understanding and unity to prove that we are peace-loving people and want progress and development of our city and country.Akhtar, while talking to the leaders of Bohra community, said this community had a big role in the development and progress of Karachi and they always supported promotion of love and harmony among the people.He said the development works, including road carpeting, street lights maintenance and cleanliness were started in the city before the start of Muharram and now these are being completed rapidly so that the citizens could be saved from any inconvenience while performing religious rituals during Muharram.He said currently their top-most priority is arrangement for cleanliness and road repair and carpeting around the Imambarghas and other locations in the city. The Bohra community leaders thanked Dr Farooq Sattar and Mayor Karachi Wasim Akhtar for visiting the Taheri Masjid.This report was originally published in The News"
426,"WASHINGTON: Internet giants, including Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O), are moving to compromise on several major policy issues as they adjust to an abrupt shift in the political winds in Washington.Just last week, the US Senate took a big step toward advancing legislation that would partially strip away the internet industry’s bedrock legal protection, a 1996 law that shields companies from liability for the activities of their users.At the same time, Democratic senators are writing legislation that would create new disclosure rules for online political ads after Facebook this month revealed that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. The US Federal Election Commission is considering bringing in Facebook and other tech firms for a public hearing.Unlike in Europe, where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion-dollar fines, internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the United States, even as their market power continues to grow. Amazon (AMZN.O), for example, controls more than a third of US online commerce, while Google and Facebook combined account for more than sixty percent of the US digital ad market.Internet firms have from their inception urged US politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections. These firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama, which saw several officials go to work for Google upon leaving the White House.But some Democrats, still bitter over Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election, are now expressing alarm at the industry’s power. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the “wild, wild West” and is working on legislation to require more disclosure.On the Republican side, President Donald Trump has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks. Google and Facebook have been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook.Now, the Internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation, according to congressional aides, industry lobbyists and company sources.“Tech is no longer the golden goose,” said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Maybe it’s a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy.”Silicon Valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown, in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry, notably the Federal Trade Commission, remain severely understaffed.But the shift in tone is palpable.On Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on Facebook, which, unlike television ads, do not fall under US law requiring disclosure of who pays for them. Requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads.The company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 US presidential election.The moves marked an about-face for Zuckerberg, who after the November election said it was a “crazy idea” to think that activity on Facebook swayed the vote.Facebook has also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies, formally known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The legislation, which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking, has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet.But after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex-trafficking victim - which followed two big tech companies, Oracle (ORCL.N) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue - Facebook and Google have opened the door to negotiation on the bill, according to congressional aides and industry sources.In a statement, Erin Egan, Facebook’s vice president of US policy, said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to “address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens.”The tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of Congress that it perceived as threatening, including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report “terrorist” activity to the government.But the effort to amend Section 230 is seen as different. The fast progress of legislation, introduced in August, has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked Congress.The bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the lead architect of the Section 230 legislation, said in an interview with Reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term, with or without Silicon Valley’s cooperation.The bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the Senate; a companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Portman said he had met with Trump’s daughter and advisor, Ivanka Trump, who expressed strong support.“Frankly, I am disappointed (that) more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort,” Portman said. “It is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem.”"
427,"LOS ANGELES: A wave of protests swept across the National Football League on Sunday as President Donald Trump escalated his feud with players who kneel during the US national anthem to draw attention to racial injustice.Trump ignited a firestorm of criticism after comments on Friday in which he described NFL players who chose to take a knee through renditions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as ""sons of b******"" who should be fired.The US leader doubled down on those remarks in an early morning tweet, urging fans to boycott the NFL as long as the protests continued.""If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!"" Trump wrote.Yet players throughout America´s most popular sport took a defiant stance just hours later, kneeling, linking arms or raising clenched fists during the anthem.More than 150 players could be seen kneeling or sitting in the 14 games that took place Sunday, easily the largest such demonstration since former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first began protesting in 2016.One of the biggest protests took place in the nation´s capital, where almost the entire lineup of the Oakland Raiders team sat on their bench ahead of their game with the Washington Redskins.A day of demonstrations began at the London game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens at Wembley Stadium, where a large number of players from both teams knelt.In Nashville, neither the Seattle Seahawks nor the Tennessee Titans took to the field to observe the national anthem.""We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of this color in this country,"" Seattle players said in a statement just prior to kickoff.In Foxborough, around 15 members of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots took a knee during the anthem.Star quarterback Tom Brady stood but linked arms with his teammates. Reports said the protests were greeted with scattered boos as some fans chanted ""Stand up!""Patriots receiver Brandin Cooks, who scored the game-winning touchdown, later explained his decision to kneel, rejecting accusations it was unpatriotic.""A lot of people think we´re disrespecting the flag and the military, but my father was a marine, my uncle was a marine, family fought in the Vietnam war -- I have the utmost respect for the men and women that fight for our freedom,"" Cooks told reporters.In Chicago, the Pittsburgh Steelers chose to remain in their locker room during the anthem ahead of their clash with the Bears.Buffalo Bills star Lesean McCoy, who stretched on the turf during the anthem, said: ""I can´t stand and support something where the leader of our country is acting like a jerk.""In Detroit, meanwhile, the singer of the national anthem Rico LaVelle dramatically dropped to his knee at the end of his rendition. At least eight Detroit Lions players were seen kneeling during the anthem while others linked arms.Trump responded to the protests on Twitter. ""Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable,"" he wrote.In subsequent remarks to reporters, Trump denied there was a racial dimension to his criticism of activist athletes, most of whom are black.""This has nothing to do with race or anything else. This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag,"" Trump said.The players´ protests were the latest twist in a bitter war of words between Trump and US professional sports.On Saturday, he had also drawn a furious backlash from NBA stars after stating on Twitter that the champion Golden State Warriors and star Stephen Curry would not be invited to attend a White House reception.Trump´s outburst drew a stinging response from across the NBA, with Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James describing the US leader as a ""bum.""The trenchant response from NFL and NBA players to Trump´s comments had shown signs of spreading to other leagues, with a baseball player kneeling during the anthem on Saturday.In game one of the WNBA Finals on Sunday, members of the Los Angeles Sparks remained in their dressing room during the anthem. Their opponents, the Minnesota Lynx, stood to attention with arms locked.Track and field star Allyson Felix, a six-time Olympic gold medallist, also spoke out in support of the protests.""Enough is enough. We have the power to create change,"" she said.Kaepernick´s protest was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in America following a spate of deadly police shootings of black men.Critics counter that the protests are disrespectful of the country and its military."
428,"KARACHI: Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) terminated on Monday the basic membership of Senator Mian Muhammad Ateeq Shaikh for violating the party line during the vote on the Electoral Reforms Bill in the Senate last week.Senator Ateeq gave his vote in support of the amendment in the Political Parties Order 2002. The successful passage of the bill has provided legal justification for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to head the Pakistan Muslim League –Nawaz.A consultative party meeting on the issue was convened by MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar, seeking clarification from the lawmaker about his support to the PML-N.Later, while talking to the press, Sattar informed that the party decided to terminate the basic membership of the senator for his vote against the party policy. He has also been asked to resign on ethical grounds.“We were supporting Pakistan Peoples’ Party’s motion on the issue, however, Senator Ateeq voted against the party’s policy,” he said.Meanwhile, Senator Ateeq, while speaking to Geo News, said that the policies of Pakistan Peoples’ Party were not clear to him on the issue. He added that Sattar did not inform him of his membership suspension during the party’s meeting.He added that Sattar or the party had no role in his decision to vote for the bill.On the same issue, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf served show-cause notices on Monday to two of its senators on their absence during the Senate session.The notices were given to Senator Brig (retd) John Kenneth Willams and Nauman Wazir Khattak.Both the lawmakers have been directed to submit their response to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan within seven working days of the receipt of the notice. Editorial note: An earlier version of this story misstated that the senator's party membership had been suspended. The error is regretted. "
429,"Poet Munir Niazi wrote a famous couplet: “Kuch sheher de log vi zaalim sun, kuch sannu maran da shaq vi si.” (The people of this city were cruel, but I also had a wish to die).Ten years after Benazir Bhutto's assassination, we are back to where we began. While we are busy pointing accusatory fingers at each other, the real killers have walked free, due to insufficient evidence. I have been following this case as a serious student, studying all related reports – by the United Nations, the Joint Investigation Team, the Punjab Special Branch and the Scotland Yard – as well as closely following the details of the investigations and inquiries into Pakistan’s most consequential political assassination. During the course of it, I met over 100 people who had a role in the happenings and interviewed the investigators. This resulted in a 750-page book that I authored under the title, “Qatil Kaun?” By no means is the book the final word on the murder inquiry. But, for me, it was the first step towards understanding the case. If you ask me today, I will tell you that Bhutto’s murder inquiry was, and is, the most thoroughly investigated case in the history of Pakistan.The recent remarks by former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf and Pakistan People’s Party leader Asif Zardari are merely politically point scoring. Both do not have any direct link with the killing. Although the Federal Investigation Agency did record Musharraf's statement and name him in the official documents, but that was only in terms of security concerns. He is never listed as one of the planners of the assassination.None of the compiled reports, by Pakistani investigation agencies, name Musharraf as a suspect. However, the UN report does hold him responsible for not providing adequate security to Bhutto on the day. The report further mentions the names of other serving uniformed officers, but then-President Asif Ali Zardari and then-Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi expressed reservations about those passages in a letter to Ban Ki-moon, the UN’s Secretary General. In this way, the state of Pakistan refused to follow the UN report in its entirety. One of the UN investigators, Heraldo Munoz even compiled his findings in a book, published in 2013. On the other hand, opponents of the Pakistan People’s Party have always maintained that Bhutto’s husband, Zardari, had a hand in her murder, even though not one of the investigation agencies of Pakistan, Britain or the UN have found any direct link. Besides Zardari, fingers have also been pointed at Rehman Malik and Babar Awan accused of running off with the other bulletproof car, and at the mysterious signal by Khalid Shahenshah, a top security guard. But these accusations come from those not part of the probe. They are merely conspiracy theories, with no shred of evidence.The truth of what happened that day, as backed up by scientific evidence and investigation, is that Saeed alias Bilal was brought to Rawalpindi as a suicide bomber. DNA collected from his remains confirmed that he was from Waziristan. While data collected from telephone calls further unearthed two more facilitators, Rafaqat Hussain and Hasnain Gull, who brought Saeed and one other suicide bomber to Rawalpindi. (Both of the alleged facilitators are still in jail although the court has set them free). The men then dropped Saeed, alias Bilal, at Liaqat Bagh in a taxi. Hussain owned a taxi and had previously also facilitated a Eurasian suicide bomber named Akrama who had been assigned to target politician Sheikh Ahmed Rashid. When he could not locate Rashid, the bomber then detonated his vest outside the house of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The facilitators, Hussain and Gull, both belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban’s Haqqania Akora Khattak faction, which pledged allegiance to Baitullah Mehsud. Pakistan’s intelligence agencies also traced out Qari Nadir, alias Ismail, and Nasrullah, alias Ahmed, who had brainwashed the bomber and provided him with an explosive-laden jacket. These facilitators were traced, arrested and interrogated by our military agencies. They later died in an encounter by law enforcement agencies. The men belonged to that militant wing of the TTP, which had aligned itself with al Qaeda and took direct orders from Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was due to this reason that Zawahiri personally claimed responsibility for the assassination. Those who pulled the trigger have been identified. But are there others, who may have indirectly facilitated the murder? Regardless, the first order of business should be to punish those who killed her, while the associates and abettors can be punished thereafter.It is not only the state’s responsibility but also that of the people to ensure that Bhutto's murderers are brought to justice. However, carelessness, indifference or cravenness may be the real impediments to closing this case. During the hearings, many witnesses refused to appear in court. Judges feared the consequences. While the proceedings were held not in courtrooms but within the state prison. A determined prosecutor was also murdered for which al Qaeda claimed responsibility. Bhutto’s own party took very little interest. And so the case languished, and the outrage increased. Everyone wanted to know if they would get justice in a country where the twice-elected prime minister could not?There needs to be a clear and dividing line between politics and crimes. Benazir Bhutto’s death was a crime and a very tragic one. Whoever wishes to use it for political gains is no well wisher of the state. If Zardari and Musharraf must spar, then let their weapons be anything but the heinous murder of Bhutto. Otherwise, the fate of this political assassination will be similar to those of many others in Pakistan. The accusations will continue to flow at those involved only by association, and not at those who killed her.Suhail Warraich is a senior journalist and analystThe views and opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."
430,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has suspended programme loans/budgetary support for Pakistan owing to deteriorating macroeconomic indicators; however, the Washington-based lender will continue providing project loans to Islamabad, it is learnt. “Last month, the WB team conveyed Pakistani authorities that they cannot provide programme loans/budgetary support because of macroeconomic indicators,” sources from the World Bank based in Washington confirmed to The News here on Sunday.The WB, they said, linked provision of programme lending with letter of comfort (LoC) from the IMF. The IMF used to gauge the economic health of the country on the basis of macroeconomic indicators, so it seemed that dark clouds had started hovering around Islamabad for luring them for entering into another bailout package from the IMF. Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves had started depleting in the wake of rising current account deficit, and it had already evaporated around $4.5b in last few months after saying goodbye to the IMF. Now, the reserves held by the SBP stood at $14.7b and around $4b forward booking the net reserves were just over $10b which could hardly meet three months import bill requirements. When contacted a top official at the Finance Division on Sunday evening, he said that the WB did not formally convey about halting programme loan for Pakistan. He said that Islamabad had not yet made any request for the programme loan. He also said that Pakistan and the IMF would hold post programme monitoring (PPM) within this calendar year, but its exact schedule and venue was not yet finalised. The WB provides its assistance in shape of IDA and IBRD, and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had to struggle a lot for restoring IBRD lending as it provided on the basis of certain performance criteria. Now, again this lending was halted for the time being till Pakistan improves its economic indicators by raising foreign currency reserves level in months ahead.After disqualification from the IBRD, now Pakistan will be able to borrow through the IDA only in accordance with its allocated quota and additional borrowing in shape of IBRD will remain suspended until the country improves its macroeconomic indicators.In the WB’s latest report on Pakistan, the Bank stated that since coming to power in 2013, the Government of Pakistan implemented an ambitious economic reform programme. As a result, external and internal macroeconomic balances improved markedly, and the country made strides in important agendas, such as taxation, the energy sector and the business environment. As the government completed four years in office, there are concerns that progress is stalling. The first half of FY17 suggests deteriorating internal and external balances. Privatisation efforts have stalled, which has also affected the broader reform efforts in the electricity sector, with the resurgence of circular debt.Reforms in areas that require collaboration between federal and provincial governments remain challenging. Reform momentum will need to continue to maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth.However, the Finance Ministry spokesman stated that the current account deficit reached $2.6b (0.76 percent of the GDP) in July-August FY 2018, from $1.3b (0.42 percent of the GDP) in last year. On MoM basis, the external account position is showing an improvement and CA improved by 73 percent during August 2017 over July 2017 on account of better exports, remittances and FDI growth. Exports: Exports started showing positive results during FY2018 due to several initiatives for the promotion and facilitation of exports, such as mark-up rates has been reduced on Export Re-finance Facility (ERF) from 8.4 percent to 3.0 percent. Prime Minister’s package of Rs180b is also aiding the export sector. During Jul-Aug FY2018, exports posted a significant growth of 17.9 per cent and on MoM basis 14.3 per cent in August 2017.Remittances: During July-August FY2018, overseas Pakistani workers remitted $3.496b as compared to$ 3.089b received during the same period in the preceding year, which is higher by 13.18 per cent.FDI: FDI amounted to $2.411b during FY2017 compared to $2.305b during same period last year, posting a growth of 4.6 per cent. During July-August, FY2018, FDI posted a significant growth of 154.9 per cent which bodes well for the balance of payment, the spokesman concluded.— Originally published in The News"

432,"COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh: The World Health Organisation warned Monday of a growing cholera risk in the makeshift refugee camps in Bangladesh where more than 435,000 Rohingya Muslims have sought shelter from unrest in Myanmar.A month after the exodus began, those dispersed in some 68 camps and settlements along the border do not have safe drinking water and hygiene facilities, according to the WHO.The camps also face dire shortages of food and medicine in what has quickly become one of the world's largest refugee settlements.""Risk of water-borne diseases is high, especially there is a very high risk of cholera and this is why everyone is concerned,"" the WHO said in a statement.""Interventions are being scaled-up, however, the situation remains critical and challenging.""The latest influx has overwhelmed the camps around Cox's Bazar, which previously housed at least 300,000 people who had fled earlier violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state.The WHO says mobile medical centres have been set up, while Bangladesh health authorities say they have treated some 4,500 Rohingya for diarrhoea in a month and vaccinated some 80,000 children for measles and polio.""We are trying our best to face the challenges. But we are concerned,"" Enayet Hossain, deputy head of Bangladesh's health services department, told AFP.The department said that at least 10 Rohingya have died in Bangladesh since the influx, most from bullet and blast wounds suffered in Rakhine.Two elderly Rohingya men died of diarrhoea at a charity clinic more than a week ago, said Misbah Uddin Ahmed, a health department official at Ukhia, where most of the camps are located.""They were also suffering from old age complications and gastroenteritis,"" he told AFP.Two Rohingya women, aged 50 and 60, were shifted to a hospital in the port city of Chittagong after they were diagnosed with HIV, police said.Ahmed said specialists from Bangladesh's International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDRB) and government scientists had visited camps to take samples.""They are going to set up two field stations here,"" he told AFP.The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) group said last week the camps were on the brink of a public health disaster as filthy water and faeces flow through shanties.It said a ""massive scale-up of humanitarian aid"" was needed, with adults on the cusp of dying from dehydration.But Ahmed said the situation was improving as hundreds of latrines and tube-wells were being dug by government services and local charities.The army, which has taken over aid management, says it has made sanitary facilities the ""highest priority"" in an effort to stave off a health emergency.""The situation is still under control,"" Ahmed said.More than 436,000 refugees have crossed the border from Rakhine since August 25 when a military crackdown was launched following attacks by Rohingya militants, according to UN figures on Monday.The refugees have given shocking accounts of killings and mass rapes by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs.

The report states that almost 90% of the total volume of requests originated from only four countries, namely, France, Germany, Russia and Turkey. The highest number of requests came from Turkey, accounting for approximately 45% of the overall worldwide total. The Turkish government and courts made a removal request for a total of 2,710 accounts. Turkey also had the highest number of withheld accounts at 204, followed by Russia at 87.India’s request for account removal stood at 104, up from 96 from the July-December period last year and more than double from last year. Saudi Arabia made only four removal requests, compared to one from the preceding six-month period.The writer works at Geo. She tweets @Sindhu_Abasi"

""If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!"" Trump wrote.More than 150 players could be seen kneeling or sitting in the 14 games that took place Sunday, easily the largest such demonstration since former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first began protesting in 2016.“We have a lot of work to do, and we can do it, but the comments by the president make it harder,” said Khan.“That’s why it was important for us, and personally for me, to show the world that even if we may differ at times, we can and should be united in the effort to become better as people and a nation,” he added.

441,"Human Rights Watch on Saturday confirmed the Bangladeshi officials' allegations that security forces of Myanmar were laying landmines alongside the border to hinder and prevent Rohingya Muslim refugees from fleeing the Rakhine state, Geo News reported.Latest reports suggest that Rohingya refugees are now at a higher risk of being killed as they attempt to flee the mass genocide being carried out in Myanmar, facing bullets and landmines along their way outside the country.Noor Karim — a Rohingya refugee — says he managed to escape firing by Myanmar forces but was somehow separated from his wife and children at some point on the way.""I have not heard of any Rohingya crossing the border in the past five days. All I could see is people concentrating near the main camps,"" Farid Alam — a Rohingya leader — said.Rohingya community leaders noted that most of the Rakhine villages near the Bangladesh border are now deserted.""Almost all the people I know have arrived in Bangladesh,"" Yusuf Majihi — another Rohingya leader at a camp at Balukhali near Cox's Bazar — told AFP.""Village after village has become empty due to the attacks by Myanmar soldiers and torching of the houses by Moghs (Buddhists),"" he stated, adding that ""those who are left in Rakhine live far off the border"".Amnesty International said new videos and satellite imagery indicated fires were still raging through Rohingya villages, scores of which have already been burned to the ground.Amnesty also accused the military of starting fires in the region to prevent refugees from returning despite the Myanmar army chief placing the blame for an explosion outside a mosque in Rakhine on Rohingya militants.Min Aung Hlaing — the Myanmar commander-in-chief — issued a statement saying Rohingya militants planted a ""home-made mine"" that exploded in between a mosque and madrasa in Buthidaung township on Friday.Hlaing went on to accuse militants of trying to drive out around 700 remaining villagers.Aung San Suu Kyi — the much-criticised de facto leader of Myanmar — said this week that troops had ceased ""clearance operations"" targeting Rohingya militants in Myanmar's border area.Analysts, however, highlighted that the militants' influence depends on the networks they have built across Rohingya communities.The United Nations previously said the military crackdown could amount to “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. But despite the calm on the border, there were new signs of unrest in Myanmar.According to government figures, nearly 40 percent of Rohingya villages in northern Rakhine have been abandoned over the past month.A number of Rohingya, including children, have been killed by mines at the border.Yet another Rohingya leader commented on how almost 40,000 refugees — currently present in India — are at a risk of expulsion, following the fresh series of attacks.Indian forces are allegedly also hindering the passage with the use of stun guns and chilli pellets and mines in order to halt the overflowing number of Rohingya refugees trying to escape the brutal situation back home.India has stepped up security along its largely porous eastern border with Bangladesh and is using “chilli and stun grenades” to block the entry of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in their homeland, officials said on Friday.Border forces in the Hindu-majority India — that wants to deport around 40,000 Rohingya already living in the country, citing security risks — have been authorized to use “rude and crude” methods to stop any infiltration attempts.“We don’t want to cause any serious injury or arrest them, but we won’t tolerate Rohingya on Indian soil,” a senior official with the Border Security Force (BSF) in New Delhi said.“We’re using grenades containing chilli spray to stop hundreds of Rohingyas trying to enter India… the situation is tense,” the official — who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media — added.R.P.S. Jaswal — a deputy inspector general of the BSF patrolling a large part of the border in India’s eastern state of West Bengal — said his troops were told to use both chilli grenades and stun grenades to push back the Rohingya.A chilli grenade makes use of a naturally-occurring compound in chilli powder to cause severe irritation and temporarily immobilize its target.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government is growing increasingly hostile towards the Rohingya in India, with Home Minister Rajnath Singh calling on Thursday for their deportation as illegal migrants.Most of the peace-loving refugees had no link to criminal activity, two Rohingya men protesting against the deportation move told India’s top court on Friday.More than 270 Rohingya have been in Indian jails since 2014.“Our investigations have revealed that Al Qaeda wants to use India and Bangladesh as their base to start a religious war against Myanmar,” said New Delhi police official Pramod Singh Khuswah.""Clearly they are a threat to our security.”"
442,"BERLIN: Germany’s Angela Merkel turns to the complex task of sounding out partners in a potentially fragile coalition after securing a fourth term as chancellor in Sunday’s election even though her conservatives bled support to the far-right.Damaged by her handling of the 2015 migrant crisis, Merkel’s conservative bloc won 32.9 percent of the vote, down 8.6 points from the 2013 election and hitting its lowest level since 1949.However, hers was still the biggest parliamentary bloc and Europe’s most powerful leader stressed that as the strongest party, her conservatives have the mandate to form the next government.“There cannot be a coalition government built against us,” she said, adding she was sure there would be a stable government by Christmas.However, a complicated and potentially unstable three-way coalition with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens, untested at the national level, with a weaker Merkel could unsettle investors.The euro EUR=D4 slipped in early Asian trading on Monday trading down 0.4 percent at $1.1906, with the prospect of months of uncertainty in Europe's biggest economy looming.One of the biggest shocks was the strength of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) which won 13.0 percent of the vote. It was the first time a far-right party entered the German parliament in more than half a century.Some business leaders were alarmed, saying a party likened by the foreign minister to Nazis could hurt Germany.“The AfD in the German Bundestag (parliament) is damaging our country,” employers’ association BDA leader Ingo Kramer said. “The other parties now have the task of cornering the AfD in direct parliamentary debate.”One of the AfD’s leading candidates, Alexander Gauland, gave a foretaste of what is to come, vowing to “hound” Merkel and “get our country and our people back”.Industry leaders urged Merkel to move fast.“Our companies need clear signals. Now it’s all about averting damage to Germany as a place of business,” Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI industry association, said.After her current Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partner, said it would go into opposition after slumping to a post-war low of 20.6 percent, Merkel’s main option is to pursue a three-way partnership.A “Jamaica” alliance of her conservative bloc, the FDP, on 10.6 percent, and the Greens, on 8.9 percent, could be fragile due to fundamental differences on issues from migrants to tax and Europe.In particular, a weakened Merkel who has to share power with the FDP is likely to create problems for deeper integration of the euro zone as suggested by French President Emmanuel Macron.Final results are due early on Monday and during the day, parties will meet and hold news conferences."
443,"PRAGUE: Roger Federer won the inaugural Laver Cup for Team Europe on Sunday, beating back a fierce challenge from players from the rest of the world to claim the trophy in a dramatic final match of the weekend.Despite cruising through the first two days, the Europeans needed the last match to finalise the victory and show the dominance expected from a team featuring five of the world’s top seven players.Federer delivered in a tight 4-6 7-6(6) 11-9 win over world number 20 Nick Kyrgios, with the Australian pushing to the final point as he sought a win that would have forced an overtime doubles match to decide the tournament.But Kyrgios squandered a chance at match point and then smashed the ball into the net to end the battle, spurring Federer’s European team mates, led by top-ranked Rafael Nadal, to leap off the bench and embrace the Swiss at the net.“I was ready to go. I had to be. That is what a team member does. The boys played fantastic all weekend but we knew it could change very quickly on Sunday,” Federer said.“I was looking at getting ready maybe for doubles at the end... But I got it done.”An earlier victory from big-hitting German Alexander Zverev also helped fight off the last-day comeback from Team World, which entered the day 9-3 down after dropping six of the first eight matches.With matches worth three points on Sunday - versus two on Saturday and one on Friday - the group battled back with Americans John Isner and Jack Sock downing Croatian Marin Cilic and Czech Tomas Berdych, who was playing in front of the hometown crowd at Prague’s O2 Arena.The American duo limited the hard-serving Europeans to three aces in a 7-6(5) 7-6(6) victory.Zverev, the youngest player in the top 10 at age 20, then faced Team World’s highest ranked player at number 16, Sam Querrey. He broke the American’s serve midway through the first set and never looked back en route to a 6-4 6-4 win.That left Nadal to face Isner, winless in six career meetings with the Spaniard. But the world number 17 rattled Nadal from the beginning and delivered a barrage of 23 aces and several forceful winners and drop shots.“I walked to the court like I had absolutely nothing to lose and I just went for it,” Isner said.Federer then played hero, battling back after dropping the first set to Kyrgios who had looked to keep Isner’s giant-killing momentum going.The Laver Cup, named after Australian tennis hero Rod Laver, has won plaudits from the players. Matches were close despite fears they would be little more than an exhibition.Federer and Nadal, the game’s top two players who split this season’s four grand slams, teamed up on Saturday, putting aside a long-running rivalry to play doubles competitively for the first time, giving fans an eagerly anticipated treat.With next year’s play moving to Chicago, a John McEnroe-captained Team World will look to bounce back against Bjorn Borg’s Team Europe.“We were so, so close to pulling this off,” McEnroe said."
444,"The house and the last resting place of Syed Maududi, the founder of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI), is located in Ichra, an area of Lahore that falls in the National Assembly constituency NA-122. Going by the recent by-elections, it appears that the grave of the party itself is situated in the adjoining constituency of NA-120. At the same time, this constituency may be known in future as the birthplace of two new religio-political entities, the Milli Muslim League (MML) and the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) party.One out of the 272 constituencies does not make a reliable statistical sample. However, something is happening in Pakistan’s religious politics that may have far-reaching consequences. The sudden emergence of two new religious parties and the fact that they collectively bagged 11 percent of the votes cast in one of the most important constituencies of the country has surprised everyone.Where have these votes come from? The PML-N’s share of the vote in the constituency was reduced to 49.3 percent from 61 percent in 2013 election ie a loss of 12 percent. The PTI increased its share from 35 percent to 37.6 percent. This is a gain of merely 2.6 percent. It is safe to assume that a sizable section of voters with strong religious convictions have left the PML-N, at least in one constituency, after a long association.The PML-N had gained the religious vote bank at the very beginning when voters were divided between the pro-Bhutto and the anti-Bhutto sentiment. Nawaz Sharif had emerged as a major challenger to Bhutto’s ghost and his daughter, who were threatening entrenched interests and established power centres.The JI joined the PML in an electoral alliance facilitated by agencies with the goal to stop Benazir Bhutto. When JI walked out of the alliance, called Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), its voters decided to stay put with Nawaz Sharif. Tahir Mehdi, an expert on elections, has made this interesting observation regarding the 1993 elections. “The six million votes that had purportedly been deposited by the ‘establishment’ in the IJI’s account in 1988 now moved to Nawaz Sharif’s account, while his politics earned him an interest of two million additional votes.” The JI, however, went bankrupt.Two things happened during the PML-N’s recent tenure that made religious voters unhappy: the military operation against religious militants and the hanging of Mumtaz Qadri. The operation has made those voters angry who espouse violent ideologies. On the other hand, Qadri’s hanging has outraged the staunch Barelvi voter. The PML-N itself has moved to the centre and can be termed as a centrist rather than rightist political party.Unfortunately, religious groups after playing a second fiddle to state institutions for a long time have asserted their agency in a violent and forceful way. We can no longer assume that they are mere pawns in the hands of the establishment. NA-120 is interesting because it marks a reverses a trend that was set in the early 1990s. Religious voters have left a mainstream party, but instead of coming back to an established religious party like the JI, they have voted for brand new religious entities.Both parties are based on single agendas and hatred for the ‘enemy’. Tehreek-e-Labbaik started out as a movement to get Qadri freed, but changed its name and entered politics after his execution. Its rallying cry is “death to blasphemers”. However, it also wants to milk the prevailing anti-corruption sentiment. While Imran Khan promises to end corruption in 90 days, Khadim Hussain Rizvi can perform this miracle in a single day.The Labbaik Party is easier to explain as it is a protest platform led by angry Barelvi mullahs who had vowed to take their revenge on Nawaz Sharif. This platform is not backed by a strong organisation. Barelvis are notoriously disorganized. Their vote bank remains split just as their religious devotion is shared among thousands of spiritual masters. It may not be easy for the party to repeat this performance in other constituencies in the future.It is the MML that has the strength, stamina and resources to replace parties like the JI as a credible religio-political platform. In a way, the Milli Muslim League is the new Jamaat-e-Islami. While the Jamaat-e-Islami went from politics to jihad, the MML has turned from jihad to politics. Like the JI, it has not resorted to violence within the country, and focuses on welfare activities instead. These welfare activities are a mechanism to compete with the huge patronage networks of mainstream political parties. Like the JI, it has an incredible organisation and huge resources at its command.From the very beginning, the organisation has been split into two sections. The Dawa wal Irshad works to propagate an austere, ‘purified’ version of Islam while its militant wing, the Lashkar-e-Taiba (army of the pure), is an organisation of highly trained militants who are willing to go to war wherever and whenever the amir (commander) orders. Both organisations are banned and the US government has offered a $10 million bounty for the capture of Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, central leader of the Dawa. The foundation of the political party marks a departure from the earlier stance of the organisation. Hafiz Saeed and his followers have always scoffed at constitutional democracy, declaring it against the tenets of Islam.Oliver Roy has noted in his wonderful book, ‘The Failure of Political Islam’, that religious politics in the Muslim world had deteriorated from Islamism to “neo-fundamentalism”. Unlike the Islamists, many of whom were serious intellectuals who tried to adapt to aspects of modernity, the neo-fundamentalists focus on channelling the discontents into political opposition. “Neo-fundamentalists worry about morals, mixed education, veiling, and the corrupting influence of the West, but they have no real political or economic program.”Going by this typology, both new groups are neo-fundamentalist to the boot. Markaz-e-Dawa activists used to burn television sets in their gathering – a gesture to reject modernity. They abhor the participation of women in any public activity. For Maulana Khadim Hussain of the TLP, any resemblance with the West is against Islam. Unfortunately, the new entities are less enlightened and more bigoted than the religious parties they aim to replace – and we know how enlightened our political Maulanas are. .Religious politics in Pakistan is organised along sectarian lines. The main weakness of the MML lies in the fact that it represents one of the most powerful sects of the country. This is the sect that has control over the International Islamic University, the country’s premier institution of religious education and is the main receiver of Saudi patronage. The support base of the MML is also limited to central Punjab from where it used to recruit fighters for jihad in Kashmir.Both the JI and the JUI have their constituencies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan where they have their patronage networks. The storm in NA-120 may not reach those areas any time soon. In Punjab, however, the new platforms will complicate things for all established political parties. The two platforms can use their performance in NA-120 to bargain for a good share in a new right-wing alliance that may emerge to erode the PML-N’s vote bank in 2018 elections.The writer is an anthropologist and development professional.Email: [email protected], Twitter: @zaighamkhan"
445,"BRISTOL: The England and Wales Cricket Board insisted Sunday it had ""no firm position"" on playing four-day Tests, adding they were ""sensitive to the potential effects of any change to the traditional format"".It had been reported that English cricket chiefs were in favour of reducing Tests from their current five days to four to fit in with modern trends such as Twenty20 which have made shorter-form cricket ever more popular.Cricket South Africa have announced plans to stage a four-day Test against Zimbabwe at Port Elizabeth starting on December 26, although the move is still subject to International Cricket Council approval.There is a view that moving to four days would, as is the case with professional golf tournaments, ensure two good ´corporate´ days on Thursday and Friday while increasing the chances of matches finishing in prime television viewing time at the weekend.Advocates also argue that a move to four-day Tests would give players more time to rest between matches in what are increasingly crowded fixture schedules. Supporters of four-day Tests have said teams would bowl more overs in a day to compensate for the loss of a fifth day.But critics point to how many Test sides struggle to bowl the scheduled 90 overs in a current standard day´s Test play as evidence of how a move to four days could reduce the amount of playing time. England staged their inaugural day/night Test against West Indies at Edgbaston last month -- a match that ended inside three days after the tourists lost 19 wickets in a day.""ECB has no firm position on the staging of four-day Test matches,"" said a spokesman for the national governing body on Sunday.""We can see benefits that more compact scheduling might deliver but are sensitive to the potential effects of any change to the traditional format.""Careful consideration is required to support the right decisions for the wider game, and on-field matters are key,"" he added.""We would welcome more insight on the effects for players and fans in order to help the game make a fully-informed decision on any proposal,"" the spokesman said.""It is important that cricket is prepared to innovate in all formats of the game where it can help drive interest, accessibility or improvement.""Above all, ECB is committed to a healthy and competitive future for Test match cricket, here and around the world.""ECB chairman Colin Graves had previously come out in support of four-day Tests, telling MCC´s website in 2015: ""Personally, I think we should look at four-day Test cricket and play 105 overs a day starting at 10:30am (0930 GMT) in the morning, and finish when you finish as all the grounds now have lights.""Every Test match would start on a Thursday, with Thursday and Friday being corporate days and then Saturday and Sunday the family days.""From a cost point of view you´d lose that fifth day, which would save a hell of a lot of money from the ground´s point of view and the broadcasters,"" he added."

A great asset for Indian cricket and I wish him all the best for the future,"" he added.It was also the Indian bowlers who set up the comfortable victory after opener Aaron Finch´s blazing century, restricting the visitors to 293-6 at the batting-friendly Holkar Stadium.In reply, Sharma, who hit 71, and Rahane, who made 70, combined the right dose of caution and aggression to give the Australian bowlers a hard time.Sharma hit a huge six off Kane Richardson early in the innings that sailed out of the ground to signal his intent. He registered his 33rd ODI fifty with another six off Ashton Agar.But the departure of the two openers created some opportunity for the Australian bowlers, who sometimes were left hard done by their fielders.Kohli tried to take charge during his 56-run stand with Pandya but lost his wicket to left-arm spinner Agar.Richardson got Kedar Jadhav caught behind for two as India suddenly found themselves in trouble at 206-4.The 23-year-old Pandya, who survived a dropped chance by skipper Steve Smith off Agar on 41, once again made it count for India after his 83 in the opening game in Chennai.Earlier Finch´s 125-ball 124 helped Australia post 292-6 in fifty overs after electing to bat first.Finch, who returned to the side after a calf injury, forged a 154-run second wicket stand with Smith, who made 63 -- giving the visitors hope of a 300-plus score.But fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah and left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav claimed two wickets each to help India fightback a strong start from the Aussies.Pandya got the first breakthrough with the all-important wicket of opener David Warner, who was bowled for 42.""I thought we set it up beautifully with the bat to launch at the back end, but I thought the Indian bowlers executed really well and we executed poorly,"" said Smith.""We couldn´t get the boundaries. 330+ might have been a different result, but credit to India. Hardik was magnificent and Rohit and Jinks (Rahane) were fabulous too.""I thought Finchy was magnificent, it was a great hundred. The pitch was pretty much the same for both teams until 35 overs, it did slow down towards the end,"" he added.India have jumped to the top of the ODI rankings for now, overtaking Australia and South Africa, but can still slip to the number-two spot if the visitors win the next two games.The fourth ODI is scheduled for Thursday in Bangalore."
450,"Kiwi cricket coach Mark Coles will take charge of Pakistan women's team for the series against New Zealand next month, New Zealand media reported. Coles, who has coached extensively in the Northern Districts region of New Zealand, was named the new coach of Pakistan women at the suggestion of his friend Mickey Arthur.The newly appointed coach will arrive in Lahore in early October for a training camp, before heading to Dubai for the series against New Zealand women.Pakistan women had a dismal run at the ICC Cricket World Cup in England earlier this year, losing all seven of their matches and finishing eighth in the round robin. According to Coles, there are simple things that need working on.“I think they just lost the big moments in those games. They played well, but when the big moments came they couldn't get the job done,"" stuff.co.nz quoted him as saying.The first round matches will be played on October 31, November 2 and November 5""Obviously the public just want them to win, like any international team. The team has been developing really nicely so hopefully we can continue that.""Coles said the latest coaching gig will help his career as a coach, and he hopes to help improve a group of players who are on the rise in women's cricket.He will be replacing Sabih Azhar, who was the coach of the women’s team during the recent World Cup. "
451,"People who do resistance exercises like weight lifting may experience less anxiety than people who don’t workout, a research review suggestsResearchers analyzed data from 16 previously published studies with a total of 922 participants who were randomly assigned to do resistance training or be inactive.Resistance workouts were associated with a reduction in anxiety symptoms regardless of whether or not participants had a mental health disorder, though the effect was more pronounced in healthy people who didn’t report any physical or psychological problems.“The positive effects of exercise training on mental health are well established; however, the majority of this knowledge is based on studies involving aerobic based training,” said lead study author Brett Gordon, a physical education and sports researcher at the University of Limerick in Ireland.“RET (resistance exercise training) significantly reduced anxiety in both healthy participants and those with a physical or mental illness, and the effect size of these reductions is comparable to that of frontline treatments such as medication and psychotherapy,” Gordon said by email. “RET is a low-cost behaviour with minimal risk, and can be an effective tool to reduce anxiety for healthy and ill alike.”Because the analysis only focused on resistance training, the results can’t show whether this type of activity might be better or worse than aerobic or other types of exercise for easing anxiety symptoms.While the effects of resistance exercise on the brain are not as well understood as the impact of aerobic workouts, emerging research has also linked resistance training to less shrinkage of white matter in the brain, said Dianna Purvis Jaffin of the Brain Performance Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas.White matter is composed of nerve fibres that connect neurons in different parts of the brain. Changes in white matter can occur with age, and are thought to be involved in cognitive and behavioural problems.It’s possible that exercise might help ease anxiety simply by distracting people from how they’re feeling and giving them something else to focus on, Jaffin, who wasn’t involved in the current study, said by email.“Exercise generally requires some level of concentration on the activity and may serve as a distraction, and at least acutely (meaning - during that bout of exercise and a bit after) interrupt rumination and obsessive worrying,” Jaffin said.“Finally, since people with anxiety tend to have uncertainty about their future, they may obsessively worry and lack confidence,” Jaffin added. “Exercise can improve self-efficacy, the belief that one can succeed in particular situations, which may make someone feel more empowered.”While the amount of exercise may influence the impact of workouts on mental health, there isn’t enough evidence available yet to prescribe a specific amount of activity, said Steven Petruzzello, a body mechanics researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who wasn’t involved in the study.Absent this sort of prescription, choosing an enjoyable workout makes sense, Petruzzello said by email.In the current analysis, people did resistance exercises on two to five days per week for an average of 11 weeks.“The best advice at the present time is to ‘just do it’ - it being whatever the person finds enjoyable or at least tolerable,” Petruzzello said. “For some that might mean going for a walk, for others it might entail more vigorous forms of activity.”"
452,"Pop star and actress Jennifer Lopez on Sunday offered $1 million for Puerto Rico as she helped launch an effort by New York state to support the hurricane-battered US island.Lopez, born in New York City to Puerto Rican parents, said she was donating the money to assorted charities and would work with fellow Latin stars to do more after Hurricane Maria killed at least 33 people in Puerto Rico and Dominica just after the devastation of mega-storm Irma.""This was the strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 20 years and the damage is horrible,"" Lopez told a news conference with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.""We urgently need to dedicate attention and support to Puerto Rico and the Caribbean through donations and any help,"" she said in Spanish.Lopez, who is dating baseball legend Alex Rodriguez, said the couple were working with athletes to arrange two aircraft to deliver supplies.New York-based airline JetBlue also promised $1 million in-kind by transporting people and cargo for relief efforts.Lopez was named co-chair of a New York state initiative to assist Puerto Rico, which will include public donation centers and government monitoring for potential abuses in aid solicitation.The initiative comes two days after Cuomo visited Puerto Rico with donations that included 34,000 bottles of water and 9,600 ready-to-eat meals.New York has historically been a hub for Puerto Ricans who move to the mainland United States. More than 700,000 residents of New York City identify as Puerto Rican, along with nearly as many people elsewhere in the state, according to non-governmental studies.""We know how much destruction has been done, and how hard it is going to be to rebuild Puerto Rico,"" Cuomo said.""We also know that given the financial pressures that the island was under before, it makes the task even more difficult,"" he said."
453,"COX‘S BAZAR: Doctors treating some of the 429,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled to Bangladesh from Myanmar in recent weeks have seen dozens of women with injuries consistent with violent sexual attacks, UN clinicians and other health workers said.The medics’ accounts — backed in some cases by medical notes reviewed by Reuters — lend weight to repeated allegations, ranging from molestation to gang rape, levelled by women from the stateless minority group against Myanmar’s armed forces.Myanmar officials have mostly dismissed such allegations as militant propaganda designed to defame its military, which they say is engaged in legitimate counterinsurgency operations and under orders to protect civilians.Zaw Htay — the spokesman for Myanmar’s de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi — said the authorities would investigate any allegations brought to them.“Those rape victim women should come to us,” he said. “We will give full security to them. We will investigate and we will take action.”Suu Kyi herself has not commented on the numerous allegations of sexual assault committed by the military against Rohingya women made public since late last year.Violence erupted in Myanmar’s northwestern Rakhine state following attacks on security forces by Rohingya militants last October. Further attacks on August 25 provoked a renewed military offensive the United Nations has called “ethnic cleansing”.Reuters spoke with eight health and protection workers in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district who between them said they had treated more than 25 individual rape cases since late August.The medics say they do not attempt to establish definitively what happened to their patients but have seen an unmistakable pattern in the stories and physical symptoms of dozens of women, who invariably say Myanmar soldiers were the perpetrators.It is rare for UN doctors and aid agencies to speak about rape allegedly committed by a state’s armed forces, given the sensitivity of the matter.Doctors at a clinic run by the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) at the Leda makeshift refugee say they treated hundreds of women with injuries they said were from violent sexual assaults during the army operation in October and November.There have been fewer rapes reported among the influx of refugees since August, Dr. Niranta Kumar — the clinic’s health coordinator — said but those they have seen have injuries suggesting “more aggressive” attacks on women.Several health workers suggested that whereas in October many women had initially remained in their villages believing the army sweeps were only targeting Rohingya men, this time most had fled at the first sign of military activity.Doctors at the Leda clinic showed a Reuters reporter three case files, without divulging the identity of the patients. One said a 20-year-old woman was treated on September 10, seven days after she said she was raped by a soldier in Myanmar.Handwritten notes say she said soldiers had “pulled her hair” and a “gun used to beat her” before raping her.Examinations often find injuries suggesting beating and even what looked like intentional cutting of the genitals, doctors said.“We found skin marks, it showed a very forceful attack, an inhuman attack,” said IOM medical officer Dr Tasnuba Nourin.She had seen incidents of genital tearing, bite marks, and signs that seemed to show a firearm was used in the sexual assault, she said.Among the new influx of Rohingya she had treated at least five women who appeared to have been recently raped, she said, adding that in each case the physical injuries observed were consistent with the patient’s account of what had happened.At Bangladesh government clinics supported by UN agencies in the Ukhia area, doctors reported treating 19 women who had been raped, said Dr. Misbah Uddin Ahmed — the head of the main health complex there — citing reports from female clinicians.“The evidence included bite marks, tearing of the vagina, these sorts of things,” he said.In one day alone — September 14, six women showed up at one of the clinics, all saying they were sexually assaulted. “They all said Myanmar army had done this.”An IOM doctor who asked not to be identified — working at one of those clinics near the Kutapalong refugee camp — said a woman who crossed from Myanmar in late August said she was raped by at least seven soldiers.“She was extremely weak and traumatized and said she struggled to make it to the clinic,” the doctor said. “She had a laceration on the vagina.”The doctor treated 15 of the 19 cases of women who appeared to have been raped and another eight women who had been physically assaulted. Some were given emergency contraceptives and all were given treatment to reduce the risk of contracting HIV and jabs against hepatitis.Symptoms included bite marks on the arms and back, tearing and lacerations on the genitals, and bleeding, the doctor said.Internal reports compiled by aid agencies in Cox’s Bazar recorded that 49 “SGBV survivors” were identified in just four days between August 28-31.SGBV or sexual and gender-based violence is used to refer to only cases of rape, according to UN doctors. Data for reported rape cases was not available for other dates.A situation report from aid agencies says more than 350 people had been referred for “life-saving care” relating to gender-based violence — a broad term that includes rape, attempted rape, and molestation, as well as emotional abuse and denial of resources based on gender — since August 25. It did not refer to the perpetrators.Kate White — an emergency medical coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in Cox’s Bazar — said the charity had treated at least 23 cases of sexual and gender-based violence including gang-rape and sexual assault since August 25.“This is a fraction of the cases that are likely to be out there,” she said.Reuters first reported allegations of mass rape of Rohingya women within days of militant attacks in northern Rakhine in October.The same reports were also heard by UN investigators who visited Bangladesh in January.A report of the UN Secretary-General in April said the sexual assaults were “apparently employed systematically to humiliate and terrorize their community”.Before her rise to power last year, Suu Kyi had spoken of rape being used as a tool of division in the country’s myriad ethnic conflicts.“It is used as a weapon by armed forces to intimidate the ethnic nationalities and to divide our country, this is how I see it,” she said in 2011 in a video message to a conference on sexual violence in conflict.Her spokesman Htay said there was “nothing to say” when asked if her view had changed since then.“Everything should be according to the rule of law,” he said. “The military leaders also have said they will take action.”"
454,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday slapped new travel restrictions on citizens from North Korea, Venezuela and Chad, expanding to eight the list of countries covered by his original travel bans that have been derided by critics and challenged in court.Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia were left on the list of affected countries in a new proclamation issued by the president. Restrictions on citizens from Sudan were lifted.The measures help fulfill a campaign promise Trump made to tighten US immigration procedures and align with his “America First” foreign policy vision. Unlike the president’s original bans, which had time limits, this one is open-ended.“Making America Safe is my number one priority. We will not admit those into our country we cannot safely vet,” the president said in a tweet shortly after the proclamation was released.Iraqi citizens will not be subject to travel prohibitions but will face enhanced scrutiny or vetting.The current ban, enacted in March, was set to expire on Sunday evening. The new restrictions are slated to take effect on Oct. 18 and resulted from a review after Trump’s original travel bans sparked international outrage and legal challenges.The addition of North Korea and Venezuela broadens the restrictions from the original, mostly Muslim-majority list.An administration official, briefing reporters on a conference call, acknowledged that the number of North Koreans now traveling to the United States was very low.Rights group Amnesty International USA condemned the measures.“Just because the original ban was especially outrageous does not mean we should stand for yet another version of government-sanctioned discrimination,” it said in a statement.”It is senseless and cruel to ban whole nationalities of people who are often fleeing the very same violence that the US government wishes to keep out. This must not be normalized.”The American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement the addition of North Korea and Venezuela “doesn’t obfuscate the real fact that the administration’s order is still a Muslim ban.”The White House portrayed the restrictions as consequences for countries that did not meet new requirements for vetting of immigrants and issuing of visas. Those requirements were shared in July with foreign governments, which had 50 days to make improvements if needed, the White House said.A number of countries made improvements by enhancing the security of travel documents or the reporting of passports that were lost or stolen. Others did not, sparking the restrictions.The announcement came as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments on Oct. 10 over the legality of Trump’s previous travel ban, including whether it discriminated against Muslims.Trump has threatened to “destroy” North Korea if it attacks the United States or its allies. Pyongyang earlier this month conducted its most powerful nuclear bomb test. The president has also directed harsh criticism at Venezuela, once hinting at a potential military option to deal with Caracas.But the officials described the addition of the two countries to Trump’s travel restrictions as the result of a purely objective review.In the case of North Korea, where the suspension was sweeping and applied to both immigrants and non-immigrants, officials said it was hard for the United States to validate the identity of someone coming from North Korea or to find out if that person was a threat.“North Korea, quite bluntly, does not cooperate whatsoever,” one official said.The restrictions on Venezuela focused on Socialist government officials that the Trump administration blamed for the country’s slide into economic disarray, including officials from the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service and their immediate families.Trump received a set of policy recommendations on Friday from acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke and was briefed on the matter by other administration officials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a White House aide said.The rollout on Sunday was decidedly more organized than Trump’s first stab at a travel ban, which was unveiled with little warning and sparked protests at airports worldwide.Earlier on Sunday, Trump told reporters about the ban: “The tougher, the better.”Rather than a total ban on entry to the United States, the proposed restrictions differ by nation, based on cooperation with American security mandates, the threat the United States believes each country presents and other variables, officials said.Somalis, for example, are barred from entering the United States as immigrants and subjected to greater screening for visits.After the Sept. 15 bombing attack on a London train, Trump wrote on Twitter that the new ban “should be far larger, tougher and more specific - but stupidly, that would not be politically correct.”The expiring ban blocked entry into the United States by people from the six countries for 90 days and locked out most aspiring refugees for 120 days to give Trump’s administration time to conduct a worldwide review of US vetting procedures for foreign visitors.Critics have accused the Republican president of discriminating against Muslims in violation of constitutional guarantees of religious liberty and equal protection under the law, breaking existing U.S. immigration law and stoking religious hatred.Some federal courts blocked the ban, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to take effect in June with some restrictions."
455,"KUALA LUMPUR: She has already captured hearts across Asia by taking on corrupt politicians and fighting bad guys who tried to shut girls’ schools – and now even the United Nations has been wowed by a superheroine whose only weapons are pens and books.Move over Superman and Batman. Here comes Pakistan’s superheroine Burka Avenger who might soon be spreading her message of peace and tolerance on behalf of the UN.The Emmy-nominated animated TV series has won global accolades since its 2013 launch, with its female protagonist - a teacher called Jiya - putting on the veil at night and transforming into an all-action heroine to tackle social ills.Now the UN is seeking to tap her popularity as it ramps up a campaign that emphasizes women’s role in peacebuilding to combat extremism.“We have a lot of shared goals,” the series’ creator, Pakistani pop star Haroon Rashid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Islamabad.“The whole concept (of Burka Avenger) came about because I was reading about girls’ schools being shut down and bombed by extremists, and women and girls are threatened with violence. That’s why the superheroine was created,” he said.Rashid will be speaking at a UN Women conference in the Thai capital Bangkok this week which will look at using creative approaches to promote women’s role in peacebuilding.Although there is no official partnership yet, the UN agency and Rashid both said they were keen to explore collaboration, including by making Burka Avenger an ambassador.“Burka Avenger can be a great messenger not only for women’s issues but because it’s animation, you can highlight very sensitive issues, it makes them (appear) softer,” Rashid said.Burka Avenger was launched first in Pakistan, then Afghanistan, India and this year in Indonesia. It has been produced in different languages including Urdu, Tamil, Hindi, Pashto and Indonesian.The series has won numerous accolades, including the Peabody Award, International Gender Equity Prize and the Asian Media Award, while the protagonist Jiya was named one of the most influential fictional characters of 2013 by Time magazine.Orphaned as a child, Jiya was adopted by a master of a mystic martial art called Takht Kabaddi, which uses pens and books as weapons to take on enemies.There has also been debate over Jiya’s choice of disguise, the burqa.The all-encompassing veil has typically been viewed as symbol of female repression in the West but the cartoon presents it in a different light, as a symbol of female empowerment.UN Women Asia-Pacific head Miwa Kato said cartoons can help prevent extremism from a young age.“We often look to law enforcement to prevent extremism but it starts very early from a child’s age, through TV and entertainment,” Kato told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“A girl and superhero using pens and books as weapons can make us start having a conversation, at home or in schools.”Burka Avenger is set for more launches in Asia - including Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Brunei, Singapore and Bangladesh - but after four seasons and 52 episodes, Rashid said he has no plans to work on new episodes immediately although he is planning a full-length feature film.“We believe that will help spread the message on a larger scale, to a larger audience,” the pop star said."

463,"KARACHI: Foreign Minister Khawaja remarked let the world match our sacrifices in the fight against terrorism on Sunday.In a social media post, Asif wrote “This is how we fight terrorism..we sacrifice our sons to defeat terror & bring peace to our land..Let the world match our sacrifices..”With the post, he even shared the pictures of Lieutenant Arsalan Alam, who was martyred in a cross-border attack in Khyber Agency on Saturday.The 22-year-old officer was commanding a post in Rajgal Valley, which borders Afghanistan when it came under fire from the Afghan side. Alam was martyred as a result of the attack. On September 5, Asif has remarked that country needs to put the house in order. Asif had said ""we need to stop [banned outfits] such as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba from carrying out activities in Pakistan so we can tell orders we have put our house in order.""'Enemy's narrative is strengthened when government officials issue public statements on internal issues,' he saidMoreover, minister remarked: “We need to tell our friends that we have improved our house. We need to bring our house in order to prevent facing embarrassment on the international level,” while speaking at Geo News programme Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath. This statement was endorsed by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. Speaking to media in London, the Pakistani premier said the foreign minister's statements regarding 'in-house cleaning' were completely true and that he agrees with the point of view that 'our own house needs to be cleaned first'.However, the statement was severely criticised by former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, who said that government officials should refrain from issuing statements that reinforce the enemy's narrative and embarrass Pakistan in front of the international community.While criticising Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif’s comments, Chaudhry Nisar said ministers should not merely issue statements, but should also find solutions to issues.He added such ministers put Pakistan in jeopardy by making such statements and let foreign powers mock the country and shed their responsibilities.The former interior minister said the country should not be made a spectacle for the enemy to take advantage."
464,"BERLIN: Germans voted Sunday in a general election expected to hand Chancellor Angela Merkel a fourth term while the hard-right nationalist AfD party was expected to make history by winning its first seats in parliament.Europe´s most powerful woman appears all but assured of winning another term, in theory matching the 16-year reign of her mentor Helmut Kohl.Surveys suggest her conservative CDU/CSU alliance has a double-digit lead over its nearest rivals, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Martin Schulz.Polling stations in Europe´s top economy will close at 1600 GMT, with exit polls due out immediately afterwards.With four other parties predicted to clear the five-percent threshold to enter the Bundestag, the highest number since the 1950s, it could take months of coalition wrangling before the next government takes shape.But mainstream parties have already ruled out talking to the anti-Islam, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is polling at 11 to 13 percent and could emerge as Germany´s third-strongest party.Alarmed by the prospect of what Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded ""real Nazis"" entering the Bundestag for the first since World War II, politicians used their final days of campaigning to urge voters to reject the AfD.""This Alternative for Germany is no alternative. They are a shame for our nation,"" former European Parliament chief Schulz told a rally on Friday.The latest surveys put support for Merkel´s conservative block at 34-36 percent, with the SPD trailing at 21-22 percent -- which would translate into a historic low for the party.Despite bracing for a drubbing, Schulz was all smiles as he and his wife cast their ballot in his western hometown of Wuerselen. Merkel and her husband voted at a polling station near their flat in central Berlin. By 1200 GMT, turnout was steady compared to the 2013 election at about 41 percent, according to official figures.Merkel, 63, whose campaign events were regularly disrupted by jeering AfD supporters, said at her final stump speech in the southern city of Munich that ""the future of Germany will definitely not be built with whistles and hollers"".Observers say a strong showing by the AfD, which has capitalised on anger over the influx of a million migrants and refugees since 2015, would hit Germany like a bombshell.""If the AfD becomes the leading opposition party, they will challenge key themes,"" said Thorsten Benner, director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin. ""It will very much change the tone of debate in parliament.""Aside from the populist noise, the past two months of campaigning have been widely criticised as lacklustre, with few hot-button issues dividing the main contenders.Commentators say Merkel´s reassuring message of stability and prosperity has resonated in greying Germany, where more than half of the 61 million voters are aged 52 or older.Schulz, on the other hand, has struggled to gain traction with his calls for a more socially just Germany at a time when the economy is humming and employment is at a record low.The SPD has also found it hard to shine after four years as the junior partner in Merkel´s left-right ""grand coalition"", marked by broad agreement on major topics, from foreign policy to migration.In the final stretch, the more outspoken Schulz told voters to reject Merkel´s ""sleeping-pill politics"" and vote against ""another four years of stagnation and lethargy"".Germany´s best-selling daily Bild at the weekend said 61-year-old Schulz found his voice as he neared the finish line, and praised him for ""fighting until the end"".""Germany doesn´t just need a chancellor. It also needs an opposition leader. Schulz has started to sound like one,"" the newspaper wrote. The CDU and the SPD have signalled they aren´t keen to continue their loveless marriage, and many rank-and-file SPD members believe the traditional working-class party would benefit from a stint in opposition to rekindle its fighting spirit.This would leave the presumed winner Merkel in need of new coalition partners -- possibly the liberal and pro-business Free Democrats, who are hoping for a comeback after crashing out of parliament four years ago.Another potential partner would be the ecologist and left-leaning Greens party, which, however, starkly differs with the FDP on issues from climate change to migration policy.Pundits have pointed out that a significant number of voters remained undecided until the last minute, suggesting the final outcome could throw up some surprises depending on turnout.In the western city of Frankfurt, 66-year-old Harald said he was still unsure who to vote for as he headed home from his night shift as a security guard in the leafy Westend suburb.""I will make up my mind once I´m in the polling booth. You can forget about the AfD,"" he told AFP."
465,"WASHINGTON: Six US air strikes on a Daesh desert camp in Libya killed 17 militants and destroyed three vehicles, the US military said on Sunday.US Africa Command said in a statement that strikes on Friday targeted a camp 150 miles (240 km) southeast of Sirte, a city that was once its stronghold in Libya. The camp was used to move fighters in and out of Libya, plot attacks and store weapons, the statement said.“Daesh and al-Qaeda have taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Libya to establish sanctuaries for plotting, inspiring and directing terror attacks,” the statement said.Daesh took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city. The group imposed its hardline rule on residents and extended its control along about 155 miles (250 km) of Libya’s Mediterranean coastline.But it struggled to keep a footing elsewhere in Libya and by last December was forced out of Sirte after a six-month campaign led by brigades from the western city of Misrata and backed by US air strikes.Daesh militants have shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya’s political divisions after their defeat in Sirte."

467,"LONDON: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi reached Pakistan late Sunday after a week's sojourn in New York and London. He was accompanied by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.It has been learnt that Dar, having arrived in the country, will appear before an accountability court to face a corruption reference filed against him.An accountability court issued arrest warrants for Dar in a corruption case against him after he failed to appear for his hearing on September 20.Dar had been in London at the time of the hearing. Following the issuance of warrants, calls for Dar's resignation echoed in the Senate.Sources said further that the premier held another meeting with former prime minister and party leader Nawaz Sharif prior to his departure from London.Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Saturday for 'important' political consultations with his brother and ousted premier Nawaz.Sharif will reach Islamabad through a PIA flight at 7:45 am on Monday, a spokesman for PML-N confirmsNawaz has been in London, along with other members of his family, to spend time with his wife who is undergoing medical treatment for lymphoma.Nawaz, his daughter Maryam, sons Hussain and Hasan, and son-in-law MNA Capt (retd) Safdar are also facing three corruption cases in the Islamabad Accountability Court and have been summoned to appear at the next hearing on September 26.The cases have been filed by the National Accountability Bureau in light of the Supreme Court's judgment in the Panama Papers case. "
468,"LONDON: Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been advised by each and every key aide against cooperating with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in proceedings of references filed against him, his children and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, but he has decided to return to Pakistan to appear before the NAB court.The former premier, who was in London for the cancer treatment of his wife Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, was advised by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and others that he should come to Pakistan after the treatment of Begum Kulsoom Nawaz.Ahead of making his decision to return to Pakistan on Sunday, which took Pakistani media and political classes by storm, Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif held two rounds of talks in which the return strategy was discussed. It's understood that both Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif agreed that the advice of lawyers should be listened to and that Nawaz Sharif should appear before the NAB court and “seek exemption”. It's also understood that the Sharif family has decided the children of the former premier will stay away from the proceedings.Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif said yesterday that Nawaz Sharif has always cooperated with the courts and he was going to Pakistan in the same spirit.Credible sources have told Geo.tv that Nawaz Sharif has been advised by his colleagues – including all key ministers – that appearing before the NAB courts will only give legitimacy to the “revenge campaign in the name of accountability”. That’s the same view he expressed ahead of leaving his house for Pakistan – he said he doesn’t hope to get justice as what has happened in Supreme Court to him wasn’t accountability but political revenge.Sources told that Zahid Hamid did brief the former premier about the legal procedures involved and the various scenarios but even he was of the view that there is no hope that Sharif will get a “fair trial”.Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has told Sharif that he doesn’t need to “rush and come to Pakistan when he pleases as there is no urgency”.The credible source said Hamid explained legal point of view “which is his responsibility as a professional lawmaker but he is at the same time aware and has seen the fraud unfolding in the name of accountability and biased disqualification of Nawaz Sharif on political grounds, in violation of Pakistan’s own tax and electoral laws”.PM Abbasi told Sharif in their first meeting last week, before the former left for America to take part in the UN session, that the whole party will stand united and behind him for any decision he takes about the NAB and other matters.The source said that in the same meeting a member stressed that NAB was “under extreme pressure to run the cases against Sharifs to execute revenge”.The PM told Sharif, said the source, that his supporters widely were of the view, and so is the view of a large section of Pakistani public, that he has been wronged and failed to get a fair trial at the Supreme Court.Sharif will reach Islamabad through a PIA flight at 7:45 am on Monday, sources saySame views have been expressed to Nawaz Sharif by Khawaja Asif and other ministers and senior PML-N leaders, who have been speaking to him over the phone from Pakistan.“Nawaz Sharif has not expressed his views on whether he will cooperate with the NAB trial or not; he has only been sounding out his aides and ministers. He will make a final decision and will announce it too but he has made no secret that he doesn’t expect fair trial from the NAB courts because of the way the SC has appointed a monitoring judge and set deadline to end the whole matter,” briefed the source.He said that Nawaz Sharif has been advised by his colleagues that this itself is the “perversion of justice that the superior court judge monitors junior judges and gives direction”.The source said Sharif was advised by several aides during the Panama Papers case that “the whole case has been engineered and brought to the SC to get him ousted from the office under the guise of accountability and the PM went along in the belief that he will get clean chit from the court because his hands are clean and then he was thrown out on the basis of Iqama just because the court found nothing in Panama case, no corruption”.He said Sharif now accepts that he made a mistake by giving legitimacy to a shambolic political plot against him “and that experience will be guiding factor for him whether or not to cooperate with the NAB”.The source said former prime minister has received overwhelming support from within the party and “even from many people in other parties who have made contact with him and told him that he has not been given justice in the Supreme Court and that while there should have been accountability of him and others, there should be no place for throwing out politicians in the name of accountability to engineer politics”.The source said the ousted premier is aware that the NAB courts will only be a rubber stamp on “the script that has been handed over to them and there is no doubt left in anyone’s mind that it would be enforcing further revenge on Nawaz Sharif and his family in the name of fair trial”.The National Accountability Bureau has also issued notification, barring the former prime minister from selling his movable and immovable properties.Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who arrived here last week to be with her parents, has publicly advised her father not to appear before the NAB courts.Nawaz Sharif ""should not be a part of political and personal victimisation in the garb of accountability"" nor should he appear before accountability courts, his daughter, Maryam Nawaz Sharif, said in a tweet.The source revealed that attempts are underway to discredit Sharif family and a “judicial cover” is being used to achieve this objective “for which there is overwhelming opposition in the PML-N rank and file”.Maryam Nawaz also said yesterday that Nawaz Sharif was going to Pakistan despite knowing that he will not get fair hearing under the current circumstances.“Knowing what he faces is NOT accountability, the man decides to return. It's not about his person anymore, it is the battle of 200 million (people),” she said in a tweet."
469,"Chancellor Angela Merkel clinched a fourth term in Germany's election Sunday, but her victory was clouded by the entry into parliament of the hard-right AfD in the best showing for a nationalist force since World War II.Merkel, who after 12 years in power held a double-digit lead for most of the campaign, scored around 33 percent of the vote with her conservative Christian Union (CDU/CSU) bloc, according to preliminary results. It was their worst score since 1949.Its nearest rivals, the Social Democrats and their candidate Martin Schulz, came in a distant second, with a post-war record low of 21 percent.But in a bombshell for the German establishment, the anti-Islam, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) captured around 13 percent, catapulting it to become the country's third biggest political force.Commentators called the AfD's strong performance a ""watershed moment"" in the history of the German republic. The top-selling Bild daily spoke of a ""political earthquake"".AfD supporters gathered at a Berlin club, cheering as public television reported the outcome, many joining in a chorus of the German national anthem.Hundreds of protesters rallied outside, shouting ""Nazis out!"" while smaller AfD demonstrations were held in other cities across the country.The four-year-old nationalist party with links to the far-right French National Front and Britain's UKIP has been shunned by Germany's mainstream but was able to build on particularly strong support in ex-communist eastern Germany.It is now headed for the opposition benches of the Bundestag lower house, dramatically boosting its visibility and state financing.Alarmed by the prospect of what Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded ""real Nazis"" entering parliament, the candidates had used their final days of campaigning to implore voters to reject the populists.Turnout was markedly higher than four years ago, up to around 76 percent from 71.5 percent.Merkel admitted that she had fallen far short of the 40-percent goal her party set.""There's a big new challenge for us, and that is the entry of the AfD in the Bundestag,"" said Merkel, adding: ""We want to win back AfD voters.""Germans elected a splintered parliament, reflecting a nation torn between a relatively high degree of satisfaction with Merkel and a desire for change after more than a decade of her leadership.Another three parties cleared the five-percent hurdle to be represented in parliament: the liberal Free Democrats at around 10 percent and the anti-capitalist Left and ecologist Greens, both at about nine percent.As Merkel failed to secure a ruling majority on her own and with the dejected SPD ruling out another right-left ""grand coalition"" with her, the process of forming a viable government was shaping up to be a thorny, months-long process.Merkel, 63, often called the most powerful woman on the global stage, ran on her record as a steady pair of hands in a turbulent world, warning voters not to indulge in ""experiments"".Pundits said Merkel's reassuring message of stability and prosperity resonated in greying Germany, where more than half of the 61 million voters are aged 52 or older.Her popularity had largely recovered from the influx since 2015 of more than one million mostly Muslim migrants and refugees, half of them from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.But the AfD was able to capitalise on anger over the asylum issue during what was criticised as a largely lacklustre campaign bereft of real clashes among the main contenders.The party has made breaking taboos its trademark.Top AfD candidate Alexander Gauland has called for Germans to shed their guilt over two world wars and the Holocaust and to take pride in their veterans.He has also suggested that Germany's integration commissioner Aydan Ozoguz, who has Turkish roots, should be ""disposed of in Anatolia"".Law student Sabine Maier dismissed the AfD as ""too extreme"" as she voted in Berlin, but added that ""they aren't all fascists"".The SPD said its catastrophic result would lead it to seek a stint in opposition to rekindle its fighting spirit.""This is a difficult and bitter day for German social democracy,"" a grim-faced Schulz, a former European Parliament chief, told reporters, adding that he hoped to remain party leader.This would leave Merkel in need of new coalition partners.If the SPD sticks to its refusal to play ball, mathematically the most likely scenario would be a link-up with the pro-business Free Democrats, who staged a comeback after crashing out of parliament four years ago, and the left-leaning Greens.That so-called ""Jamaica"" coalition, based on the party colours and the Caribbean nation's flag, would be a risky proposition, given the differences between the parties on issues ranging from climate policy to migration issues.Schulz, 61, struggled to gain traction with his calls for a more socially just Germany at a time when the economy is humming and employment is at a record low.Meanwhile, Merkel faced accusations from within her conservative camp that she had left its ""right flank exposed"" to the AfD's challenge with her centrist stance on issues such as border policy.""This is competition for the Union and the conservative spectrum in general,"" said political scientist Lothar Probst of the University of Bremen of the AfD.""A very difficult period is beginning for the chancellor."""

It really could have gone either way.""In Saturday's opener, Federer, this year's Australian Open and Wimbledon winner and the world number two, swept 16th-ranked Querrey 6-4, 6-2 after earning a break in the first set and two in the second.World number one Nadal, who won the French and US Open this season, then overcame a scare to beat 21st-ranked Sock 6-3, 3-6, 11/9.Nadal and Sock traded breaks early into the rubber but Nadal added another to take the first set.The second set was a mirror image of the first with Sock taking the honours and earning a nerve-wracking super tie-break, in which he came back from 5-1 down to level at 9-9 before Nadal showed his dominance to win.Australia's world number 20 Nick Kyrgios then gave Team World a boost as he beat 19th-ranked Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 10/6 in a clash of big servers.On Sunday, three singles and one doubles will close the tournament, with the players earning three points for each win after two on Saturday and one on Friday.On Friday, Marin Cilic beat Frances Tiafoe, Dominic Thiem overpowered John Isner and Alexander Zverev saw off Denis Shapovalov to hand Europe a 3-1 lead as Nadal and Berdych lost to Kyrgios and Sock in doubles."
473,"NEW DELHI: Apart from the concerns over Afghanistan's security challenges, fighter jets and drone deals are set to dominate the agenda when US Defence Secretary James Mattis visits India this week.Mattis is likely to seek to convince India to purchase Lockheed Martin's F-16 Block 70 aircraft — a lucrative deal pegged at approximately $15 billion.In 2016, the United States designated India a ""Major Defence Partner"" and Trump has sought to further boost military ties, praising India for contributing to regional peace and stability and purchasing US military equipment.Lockheed has offered the most upgraded version of the fighter jet to India, which is the world's largest weapons importer.The US manufacturer competes with Swedish defence giant Saab, whose Gripen E made its maiden flight in June.India has said it requires at least 100 single-engine fighters to counter the growing air threat posed by China and Pakistan.Both Saab and Lockheed offered to build the jets locally to comply with Modi's ""Make-in-India"" initiative, which aims to cut imports and build a domestic defence industry.US giant Boeing has also made an offer to set up a manufacturing facility in India for production of its F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft if it bags a deal.A drone deal for the Indian Navy will also likely be up for discussion, a source familiar with the negotiations told AFP.""Since Chinese assets have started to dominate the Indian Ocean region, the Trump administration is keen on fast-tracking the acquisition of the drones,"" the source said.Many commentators have said that US-India cooperation is crucial to countering an increasingly assertive China, which has been developing its military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.Mattis is scheduled to arrive in Delhi late Monday and will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his new defence minister in the first visit by a top US official since Donald Trump became US president in January.""The United States views India as a valued and influential partner, with broad mutual interests extending well beyond South Asia,"" a Pentagon statement said.US India Strategic Partnership Forum President Mukesh Aghi said Mattis' visit is a sign ""the political leadership in both countries place defence cooperation as a top priority"".Trump and Modi met for the first time in Washington back in June."
474,"ROME: The Vatican said Sunday it had been forced to oust its former auditor general — who resigned without explanation in June — because he had been spying on senior officials.In the latest scandal to embroil the centuries-old institution, Libero Milone had accused the Vatican of getting rid of him because his investigations into possible illegal activity had hit too close to home.Just hours after the story broke, the Vatican issued a furious response.""Milone's office illegally appointed an external company to carry out investigations into the private lives of members of the Holy See,"" it said in a statement.It is very rare for the secretive seat of the Roman Catholic Church to comment in public about internal affairs.Milone had given an interview published earlier Sunday to four media outlets including Italy's Corriere della Sera daily in which he said: ""I did not voluntarily resign. I was threatened with arrest"".The auditing wizard, who spent much of his career with the audit firm Deloitte & Touche and was hired to much fanfare in 2015, said high-ranking figures in the Vatican wanted to scupper Pope Francis's financial reform efforts.""I feel very sorry for the pope. I had a splendid, indescribable relationship with him, but over the last 18 months, they stopped me seeing him. Obviously, they didn't want me telling him about some of the things I'd seen,"" he said.While he said a non-disclosure agreement prevented him from giving details of the irregularities he uncovered, his troubles began when he hired an outside firm to check whether the computers of his team had been bugged.That was the company the Vatican believes was spying for Milone.""They accused me of having improperly looked for information on Vatican members. I found out they had been investigating me for seven months,"" he added.""I was only doing my job"".When he was hired, Vatican officials said Milone would be ""completely independent"" and would have the power to look through the books of every department in the tiny city-state, reporting only to the pope.But the Vatican said Sunday that not only had Milone broken an agreement for both parties to remain quiet about his dismissal, he had been acting as a secret agent in the tiny city-state.""The job of the auditor general is to analyse the balance sheets and accounts of the Holy See and connected bodies.""It turns out unfortunately that the office led by Milone, going outside its jurisdiction, illegally appointed an external company to carry out investigations into the private lives of members of the Holy See.""As well as being a crime, this irreparably damaged the trust placed in Milone who, when confronted with his responsibilities, accepted freely to hand in his resignation,"" it said.Pope Francis was elected in 2013 on a mandate to clean up the Vatican, including its financial house.Accelerating moves started under his predecessor Benedict XVI, he streamlined the Vatican bureaucracy and brought 21st-century auditing to the Holy See's tainted banking system.But it has struggled to shake off the whiff of scandal.The Vatican's bank, known as the Institute of Religious Works (IOR), became notorious after the 1982 death of Italian banker Roberto Calvi, whose corpse was discovered hanging from Blackfriars Bridge in London.Prosecutors believe it was a mafia killing linked to money laundering via the Vatican bank."

476,"GENEVA: A Pakistani diplomat highlighted India's disgraceful policies in the United Rights Commission (UNHRC). “India has surely become the rape capital of the world where no woman is safe due to their own disgraceful policies against women,” diplomat Murk Aijaz said.Around 327,000 crimes against women were registered in a single year in India, most of these involving rape or rape attempts.Availing right of reply at the current 36th Session of the Human Rights Council, Aijaz quoted India’s National Crime Records Bureau statistics said that more than 35,000 incidents of rape had occurred in three years in India and almost 93 rapes were committed in the country each day.She quoted reports by Asian Watch and Physicians for Humans stating that rape is used as a means of targeting women by the Indian security forces in an attempt to punish and humiliate the entire community.She told the UN forum that horrific and barbaric atrocities in Kashmir are not isolated incidents “but they represent Indian mindset of systematic disregard for human life, human values, human rights and most importantly human dignity”.The diplomat said quoting Amnesty International that a former Manipur state policeman was involved in more than 100 extrajudicial executions between 2002 and 2009.“Journalists like Karun Mishra in Uttar Pradesh and Rajdeo Ranjan in Bihar were shot dead for writing reports that didn’t go well with the Indian government. 282,000 prisoners – 68% of the total prison population – were pre-trial detainees,” she said. She highlighted the widespread human rights abuses of religious and ethnic minorities as well as lower Hindu castes. “According to India’s official statistics, more than 45,000 crimes against members of Scheduled Castes and almost 11,000 crimes against Scheduled Tribes were reported in one year. India topped the global blast list with around 406 bombings taking place last year. We can well imagine the causes. Their policy of state perpetuated terrorism is now biting them back.”Aijaz said that the current BJP Government in India is the product of the militant, hate-driven ideological parent — Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). A senior BJP official, Subramanian Swamy, in a recent speech, declared that mosques are not holy places and thus can be demolished. “A number of churches were vandalized. A 71-year-old nun in the eastern state of West Bengal was gang-raped. And the beef-ban movement was spreading to new states. How can we forget the Gujrat killing of more than 2000 Muslims in which ruling party was found as the main culprit,"" she said. ""With such leadership at the top which has no regard for life, recent barbarism in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir was always on the cards.”The Pakistani diplomat, in the UNHRC session, said that Kashmiris are not scared of demanding their right to self-determination and nor would Pakistan be intimidated by India. “We would stand with the people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan remains committed to resolving the Kashmir dispute according to the UN Security Council resolutions for a lasting peace in the region and beyond,” Aijaz said. "

489,"SEOUL/UNITED NATIONS: US President Donald Trump dialled up the rhetoric against North Korea again at the weekend, warning the country’s foreign minister that he and leader Kim Jong Un “won’t be around much longer”, as Pyongyang staged a major anti-US rally.North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that targeting the US mainland with its rockets was inevitable after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Pyongyang’s leader a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.“Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at UN If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” Trump said on Twitter late on Saturday.Trump and Kim have traded increasingly threatening and personal insults as Pyongyang races towards its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States — something Trump has vowed to prevent.Analysts say the escalation in rhetoric is increasing the risk of a miscalculation by one side or the other that could have massive repercussions.North Korea’s state-run television KRT aired a video on Sunday showing tens of thousands of people attending an anti-US rally at Kim Il Sung square in Pyongyang.The North’s official KCNA news agency said more than 100,000 people gathered for the rally on Saturday and delivered speeches supporting comments made by Kim earlier in the week.“We are waiting for the right time to have a final battle with the US, the evil empire, and to remove the US from the world,” KCNA quoted Ri Il-bae, a commanding officer of the Red Guards, as saying. “Once respected Supreme commander Kim Jong Un gives an order, we will annihilate the group of aggressors.”In an unprecedented direct statement on Friday, Kim described Trump as a “mentally deranged US dotard” whom he would tame with fire.Kim said the North would consider the “highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history” against the United States and that Trump’s comments had confirmed his nuclear programme was “the correct path”.Kim’s comments came after Trump threatened in his maiden UN address on Thursday to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people.North Korea has launched dozens of missiles under Kim Jong Un’s leadership as it accelerates a weapons programIt was not clear from Trump’s latest tweet if he was referring to Ri and Kim, or North Korea more broadly.North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, prompting another round of UN sanctions. Pyongyang said on Friday it might test a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean.“It is only a forlorn hope to consider any chance that the DPRK (North Korea) would be shaken an inch or change its stance due to the harsher sanctions by the hostile forces,” Ri told the UN General Assembly on Saturday.US Air Force B-1B Lancer bombers escorted by fighters flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea on Saturday in a show of force the Pentagon said indicated the range of military options available to Trump.Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and his regime, says Trump while referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong UnThe US bombers’ flight was the farthest north of the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea that any US fighter jet or bomber had flown in the 21st century, the Pentagon said.The patrols came after officials and experts said a small earthquake near North Korea’s nuclear test site on Saturday was probably not man-made, easing fears Pyongyang had exploded another nuclear bomb just weeks after its previous one.The United States and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty.The North accuses the United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies."

""People knowledgeable in Islam should not be solving disputes through hearsay and a public spectacle.""The popular Muslim speaker who claims to be ‘an avid and passionate student, teacher, and lecturer with a focus on Allah’s book’ has been accused of ""violating agreed-upon bounds of Islamic law"" by Omar M. Mozaffar, who claims to have known the preacher since twenty years.Khan, who has not denied his interactions with women, insists that all the conversations took place ""between consenting adults"" and were not ""inappropriate in the least bit"".Two posts on the speaker’s Facebook page explain that the reason Khan was in touch with different women was because he wanted to remarry after being divorced for two years. He added that female students on his campus have never claimed and ‘…[never] will claim that I’ve been appropriate in the least bit.’ He also wrote that his family was aware of the communication between him and ""a few prospects"".The communications were used to slander him ‘to manipulate the facts and present a narrative…to fulfil [the accuser’s] own agenda.’On Friday, Mozaffar posted a public status on his personal Facebook profile, claiming that Khan had ""confessed inappropriate interactions with various women"" and that he had been acting as a mediator between the scholar and the accusers. He said that the local Muslim community of Dallas had asked him to investigate the allegations due to his ""experience in similar previous cases, as well as [his] longtime relationship"" with the preacher.According to Mozaffar, who claims he was asked to mediate the case between Khan and the scholars, the preacher had ""agreed to stop public speeches until further notice, to get professional and religious counselling, and to cease all contact with those women.""“Nouman has now broken his agreement with us and has been sending threats against each of us through his attorney,” Mozaffar wrote.Khan has denied that Mozaffar is a longtime friend. ""The individual who posted these claims against me posed himself as a mediator and unfortunately, he was anything but,"" wrote Khan. ""He claims I’ve known him for twenty years. I’ve spoken to him in friendly ways no more than a couple of dozen times in that entire span [...] I know little to nothing about his family and he knows virtually nothing about mine. To claim he’s my friend of 20 years to insinuate that he knows my personal life is really far from the truth.""Khan alleged that Mozaffar’s post was an attempt to seek the limelight through scandal.The Director of Religious Education and Social Services at the Islamic Information Society of Calgary Navaid Aziz also posted a status on his official Facebook page, backing Mozaffar's claims.“The accusations against him [Khan] have been verified by multiple people, and some of them have even been confessed by him,” the status said.""This case has been brought to the public sphere because NAK had agreed to several conditions and went on to breach the contract,"" he wrote. ""As a general case people's sins should be concealed except when there is potential harm to others.

491,"This week, the Ranbir Kapoor and Mahira Khan controversy dominated the social media landscape — from hate to support from different corners it wasn’t short of a roller coaster ride for fans from both sides of the border.As the rumour mill got its much-needed fuel, Ranbir’s father and veteran Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor was not certainly the one to restrain himself from opining on the viral pictures.Rishi spoke to a leading newspaper and said that he saw the pictures for the first time on Twitter and he didn’t have any prior knowledge of them.“You see, Ranbir is a young star, he is unmarried, he’s a bachelor. He can meet anybody whoever he wants to, and if people are going to invade in his privacy, it’s not done. And I can’t say anything about all this because he’s a young man and he has the choice of meeting any girl,” he was quoted as saying by Pink Villa.In the same vein, Ranbir’s papa said that there’s no way of knowing if there’s more to the story from these pictures. The two could only be meeting or in a place where they couldn’t smoke so they went outside, he added.'It is very unfair the way she is being judged and spoken about. What is also sad is the inequality in judgment just because she is a woman,' said RanbirRishi said he cannot comment further on the subject because he does not know anything more than that himself — Ermm, having a hard time believing that? We too!A day ago, Ranbir himself spoke on the subject, shooting down all the hate and criticism on the matter.""I've gotten to know Mahira in a personal capacity over the last few months. She is somebody who I admire and respect, for her achievements and even more for the person she is. It is very unfair the way she is being judged and spoken about. What is also sad is the inequality in judgment just because she is a woman. I request you to stop the negativity and move on with your beautiful god gifted lives. Peace and love,"" Indian media reported Ranbir saying.The recently emerged pictures show Mahira in a white dress along with Ranbir Kapoor in New York. The pictures were taken in July when Ranbir was filming for Sanjay Dutt's biopic.Many Pakistani celebrities stepped in and spoke in favour of the Ho Mann Jahaan actress.In a handwritten note, singer Ali Zafar wrote “every woman has the right to make her own choices in life (as long as she’s not hurting anyone). Just like men do.”Actor and comedian Osman Khalid Butt turned the tables to point towards the hypocrisy in the society, posing with a friend with a cigarette in a similar pose as Mahira and Ranbir.Singing sensation Momina Mustehsan threw in her own two cents: “Jesus. Can we please give @TheMahiraKhan a break?! Why are we so quick to judge and attack?! Esp if it's a woman in question. It's her life!”"

493,"MADRID: Lionel Messi was the star of Barcelona’s blistering start to the season yet with the Argentine suffering a rare off night and big-money signing Ousmane Dembele missing through injury, it was Luis Suarez who claimed the headlines in his 100th Liga appearance for the club on Saturday.The Uruguayan sealed a comfortable 3-0 victory over Catalan rivals Girona with a clinical finish late on to reach a remarkable tally of 87 goals in his century of league games.The figures are all the more impressive given that it took Suarez almost two months to break his duck in Catalonia and that his form has been erratic this season. Before Saturday, he had just one league goal to his name and he sat out Tuesday’s 6-1 thrashing of Eibar.“It’s important for a forward who lives for goals to score. We’re delighted for him but it’s also important to point out that when he hasn’t been scoring he has been giving us other, important things: hard work, a team player, linking play,” said technical secretary Robert Fernandez of Suarez after the game.A controversial figure, having twice been banned for biting opponents, Suarez has been a mainstay in the Barca frontline since joining from Liverpool in 2014.Known for his tireless work ethic, he has also laid on 51 goals in the league for team mates with his 100 games comprising 77 wins, 11 draws and 12 losses.“Forwards live for goals. They can be low on confidence at times but they score and everything changes,” coach Ernesto Valverde said of Suarez.“His relationship with scoring goals is good for us. We’re delighted with how many chances he’s able to create.”"

497,"PRAGUE: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal took care of business in their singles matches before teaming up in an eagerly anticipated doubles pairing to extend Europe’s lead over players from the rest of the world in the inaugural Laver Cup on Saturday.The new team tennis event, kicking off in Prague and moving to the United States next year, was a first chance for the world’s top two players to play competitively side by side.Putting aside a rivalry rekindled this season after Spaniard Nadal and Swiss Federer swept all four grand slams, the pair outlasted and outclassed Americans Sam Querrey and Jack Sock to win 6-4 1-6 1-0(10-5) in the weekend’s headline match.The doubles victory put Team Europe up 9-3 going into the final day when the four matches are each worth three points.“We will always forever be rivals as long as we are active. And after this we will be rivals again,” said Federer, ranked number two in the world and holder of 19 career grand slam titles to top-ranked Nadal’s 16.“But this was something very special. Knowing you can trust him in the big moments, seeing his decision-making, seeing his thought process, it was very interesting.”“It was definitely a different day to other days in my life,” he added.The Laver Cup, named after Australian tennis hero Rod Laver, is attempting to add new excitement to the sport in an already crowded calendar and was the brainchild of Federer and his sports management company Team8.The Europeans are the clear favorites with five of the world’s top seven players and have won five of the six singles matches in the first two days.In Saturday’s first match, Federer cruised through 6-4 6-2 against world number 16 Querrey.Nadal then glided through his first set before the hard-hitting Sock fought back to force a third set, which under the event’s rules is a rapid-fire, 10-point tiebreak.Sock, who had teamed up with Australian Nick Kyrgios on Friday to take down Nadal and Czech Tomas Berdych to get Team World’s only point on the opening day, again had to claw his way out of a hole.But Nadal kept his nerve and ended the match with a winner at the net on the sleek, black hardcourt at O2 Arena to win 6-3 3-6 1-0(11-9).In the evening session, Kyrgios defeated Berdych, taking late control to win 4-6 7-6(4) 1-0(10-6).Nadal and Federer capped the evening with a thrilling win over Querrey and Sock, even after an early miscue almost caused Nadal to hit his partner as they both went for an overhead smash.“We played with too much energy, so went for everything,” Nadal said of the near-miss.After Federer served to take the first set, the American pair flew through the second 6-1 with some big serves.Two crushing winners at the net by Nadal gave him and Federer the momentum to take them easily through the tiebreak.Despite questions over competitiveness most matches have been tight and players have shown their approval.The Team World bench has stood out with players joking around, choreographing their celebrations after points and leading the crowd in the Mexican Wave."

It was then that another resident, Manzar, went down and saw all three had fainted. Manzar himself fell unconscious after coming in contact with the toxic gas. Locals said Ashfaq died on the spot whereas Ijaz and Shahzad passed away after they were taken to Allied Hospital for treatment. Hospital officials said Manzar's condition is critical.  After the incident, relatives of the deceased and locals began protesting against the authorities and placed the bodies at Akbarabad Chowk, resulting in blocking of traffic. They were chanting slogans against the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) for failing to resolve their municipal issues which forced the deceased to go down into the sewer themselves. Talking to Geo News, local WASA chief Chaudhry Faqeer said it is a very unfortunate incident. He claimed there is no sewage issue in the area, as claimed by residents. ""There is not even a one per cent fault of WASA in this case,"" he claimed. Faqeer said the locals attempted to connect a local line with WASA's main line which led to the incident. "
499,"TAIPEI/SINGAPORE: When HTC Corp brought back founder Cher Wang two years ago to turn around the struggling Taiwanese mobile phone maker, investors hoped she could stem a sharp loss in market share to Apple and Samsung Electronics.But the gamble to rebuild the early smartphone pioneer’s reputation failed, as its market share has continued to dwindle - to below 1 percent from closer to 10 percent in 2011.On Thursday, Wang announced HTC was shifting around 2,000 staff, mainly handset engineers, to Alphabet’s Google in a $1.1 billion deal that casts doubts over the company’s longer-term future.“Our main consideration is that our brand will continue,” Chialin Chang, who heads HTC’s mobile business, told reporters. “So our major releases will be as usual. In future, HTC will concentrate not on our portfolio size, but what’s in the portfolio.”Wang, a pioneer in Taiwan’s male-dominated technology industry, founded HTC 20 years ago as a contract manufacturer and established it as a leader, designing and making Microsoft-powered smartphones.It later turned out its own branded phones, but often struggled to translate positive early reviews into strong sales, despite spending heavily on marketing, including a collaboration with “Iron Man” star Robert Downey Jr for its flagship HTC One phone.It also struggled to carve out a strong consumer brand in a market where Apple and Samsung grew quickly and have since been joined by Chinese rivals such as Huawei, Oppo and Vivo.HTC shares have slumped around 90 percent since the company’s 2011 peak.This week’s deal marks a retreat from HTC’s smartphone legacy.“It may take a hard look at its smartphone business ... and think it’s probably better to wind it down as soon as possible rather than for it to drain more cash,” said David Dai, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.“If it focuses on virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), there’s a much more concrete chance the company turns things around.”That prospect pushed up HTC shares by their daily maximum of 10 percent on Friday, valuing the company at around $1.7 billion, as some investors hope the Google cash helps HTC focus on its Vive VR headsets and reduce its development costs.HTC Chief Financial Officer Peter Shen said the deal will cut operating costs by 30-40 percent.While the Google cash throws HTC a lifeline for now, it may find it hard to retain staff, analysts said.Google has cherry-picked the best people, said a former HTC executive who has spoken to current employees, adding: “It’s hard to see how anyone remaining would be enthusiastic.”“Google’s investment will probably slow, but not stop, HTC’s decline,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics.Even Vive faces tough competition against the likes of Samsung and Sony Corp, which control half the $2 billion global AR and VR headset market.HTC saw flat second-quarter growth, and had 4.4 percent market share after a price reduction.“Vive remains in the red; free cash flow is negative; book value is eroding; and sales growth is decelerating,” JP Morgan analyst Narci Chang said in a note following the Google deal.“Nevertheless... we think HTC might narrow the loss considerably... enough to keep the business afloat and beat the (market) consensus for the next few quarters.”For now, no major VR overhaul has trickled down to staff.“It (Google’s investment) could be (a good thing), but it’s business as usual,” one Vive employee told Reuters."

505,"KANDAHAR: The Taliban has shut down dozens of clinics in the southern Afghan province of Uruzgan in the past few days, officials said, amid demands for special treatment for its fighters who control most of the embattled region.Dost Mohammad Nayab, a spokesman for the provincial governor, said authorities were talking to elders, asking them to intercede with the Taliban to allow the clinics to reopen.“Hospitals are not places for politics and we are asking the Taliban to let our doctors and healthcare workers return,” Nayab said.Only three clinics, including the provincial hospital, were operating after the Taliban shut down 46 of the 49 treatment centres in Uruzgan since Friday, Nayab said. The Taliban were asking for special treatment for their fighters, he said.“We have asked elders in the areas to talk to the Taliban to fix this problem,” he said.Uruzgan, which abuts the Taliban heartlands of Kandahar and Helmand, has been under intense pressure from the insurgents for years and the defences of the provincial capital Tarin Kot were briefly overrun last year.A Taliban spokesman confirmed that its fighters had closed down dozens of treatment centres but said it was done because of poor services, underlining its push to replace basic government services in many areas under its control.“In most of these centres, there was no proper medication. There were no doctors or healthcare personnel,” the spokesman said. “We asked repeatedly for better services but no one cared. Now if the local administration does not provide basics, we will.”The incident underlines the difficulty the Western-backed government in Kabul has in exerting control in provincial regions where the insurgency is strongest.US officials estimate that the Taliban, fighting to drive out foreign forces and impose strict Islamic law on Afghanistan, control or contest around 40 per cent of the country, although they have not taken any major provincial city.Uruzgan province was identified by US commanders as a major priority for 2017 and there has been a big focus on bolstering Afghan forces with on-the-ground US training teams."

The film was chosen unanimously on Friday by a jury appointed by the Film Federation of India, the industry body that makes the pick for the Oscars each year.“This is the most incredible news of our lives — all our hard work and faith is finally paying off,” said “Newton” producer Manish Mundra.In “Newton”, the eponymous protagonist faces the threat of Maoist rebels and indifferent officials as he helps conduct elections in a remote jungle in Chhattisgarh.The makers of the critically acclaimed 109-minute film, with Rajkummar Rao and Pankaj Tripathi in the lead, hope to reverse India’s dry spell at the Oscars.Indian films have traditionally not made the cut in the foreign film category at the Oscars, with “Lagaan” the only Indian film in recent times to make it to the Academy Award shortlist for 2001.According to Indian media reports, ""Newton"" has been facing criticism for being similar to a 2001 Iranian film, ""Secret Ballot"".

508,"NEW DELHI: Fighter jets, drone deals and shared concerns over Afghanistan´s security challenges look set to dominate the agenda when US Defence Secretary James Mattis visits India this week.Mattis is scheduled to arrive in Delhi late Monday and is set to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his new defence minister in the first visit by a top US official since Donald Trump became US president in January.""The United States views India as a valued and influential partner, with broad mutual interests extending well beyond South Asia,"" a Pentagon statement said.Trump and Modi met in June in Washington, and Mattis´ visit is a sign ""the political leadership in both countries place defence cooperation as a top priority"", Mukesh Aghi, president of the US India Strategic Partnership Forum, told AFP.Delhi and Washington share concerns about Afghanistan, and Trump announced a new strategy for the war-torn country last month, which cleared the way for the deployment of thousands more US troops.The billionaire president has urged India to boost assistance to Afghanistan´s economy, and has lambasted Delhi´s arch-rival Pakistan for offering safe haven to ""agents of chaos"".Mattis ""will express US appreciation for India´s important contributions toward Afghanistan´s democracy, stability, prosperity, and security"", the Pentagon said.India has long vied with Pakistan for influence in Afghanistan, building dams, roads and a new parliament in the troubled country. Last year, it offered some $1 billion in aid.Delhi frequently accuses Islamabad of stirring up violence in Afghanistan and harbouring militant groups.In 2016, the United States designated India a ""Major Defence Partner"" and Trump has sought to further boost military ties, praising India for contributing to regional peace and stability, and for purchasing US military equipment.Mattis is likely to seek to convince India to purchase Lockheed Martin´s F-16 Block 70 aircraft -- a lucrative deal pegged at $15 billion.Lockheed Martin has offered the most upgraded version of the fighter jet to India, the world´s largest weapons importer.The US manufacturer is competing with Swedish defence giant Saab, whose Gripen E made its maiden flight in June.India has said it requires at least 100 single-engine fighters to counter the growing air threat posed by China and Pakistan.Saab and Lockheed have both offered to build the jets locally to comply with Modi´s ""Make-in-India"" initiative, which aims to cut imports and build a domestic defence industry.US giant Boeing has also offered to set up a manufacturing facility in India for production of its F/A 18 Super Hornet aircraft, if it wins a deal.A drone deal for the Indian Navy will also likely be up for discussion, a source familiar with the negotiations told AFP.""Since Chinese assets have started to dominate the Indian Ocean region, the Trump administration is keen on fast-tracking the acquisition of the drones,"" the source said.Many commentators have said that US-India cooperation is crucial to countering an increasingly assertive China, which has been developing its military capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region."
509,"DUBAI: Dubai authorities have begun telling owners of high-rise buildings across the emirate to make the facades more resistant to fire, the government said on Saturday, after a string of skyscraper blazes.The government did not specify how it would ensure that owners complied with the policy, which could be costly, or reveal how many buildings might be affected in the fast-growing city, home to hundreds of high-rise towers, including the world’s tallest skyscraper.But it said it had already implemented the policy with a number of companies, including Dubai Properties Group, which is the investment vehicle of the emirate's ruler and operates skyscrapers in Dubai's business district.The government's Real Estate Regulatory Agency ""is now strongly encouraging all owners to replace non-fire-resistant building facades in collaboration with the city’s real estate developers"", an official statement said.Eyewitness reports and investigations have suggested that cladding fixed to the outside of buildings for decoration, insulation or protection may have contributed to the spread of many fires in Dubai over the last three years.Global concern about cladding grew after London's Grenfell Tower fire in June, which killed about 80 people. A public inquiry into the blaze is underway following initial reports that it spread throughout the residential tower because of flammable cladding used as insulation.The United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a member, revised its building safety code in 2013 to require that cladding on all new buildings over 15 meters tall be fire-resistant.But the new rules did not apply to buildings erected before that year, so the vast majority of the country’s skyscrapers fell outside the regulations.Among Dubai's skyscraper fires, a blaze hit the 337-metre, 79-storey Torch residential building last month, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee. It was the second fire at the building since 2015.In August 2016, a fire damaged part of a tall building under construction in Dubai and in July 2016, a blaze broke out in Dubai's residential, 75-storey Sulafa Tower. On the last day of 2015, a fire engulfed a 63-storey Dubai luxury hotel, forcing its closure for over a year."
510,"UNITED NATIONS: Syria's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that a military victory in the six-year war was ""now within reach"" following a series of battleground gains by government forces.""The liberation of Aleppo and Palmyra, the lifting of the seige of Deir Ezzor and the eradication of terrorism from many parts of Syria prove that victory is now within reach,"" Walid al-Muallem told the General Assembly.The foreign minister, who also holds the rank of deputy prime minister in Bashar al-Assad´s government, said Syrian government forces will be remembered as heroes for their role in the war.""When this unjust war in Syria is over, the Syrian army will go down in history as the army that heroically defeated, along with its supported forces and its allies, the terrorists that came to Syria from many countries,"" he said.Assad's forces have been accused by western powers of carrying out atrocities, targeting civilians and using banned chemical weapons, an accusation that Muallem again rejected in his address.More than 330,000 people have died in the war and more than 5 million Syrians have fled across borders to become refugees.The United Nations is planning to convene a new round of peace talks in the coming weeks between Syria´s government and the opposition, even though past negotiations have failed to yield more than incremental progress.The UN-brokered negotiations have hit a wall over opposition demands for a political transition paving the way for the end of Assad´s rule.The foreign minister laid out what he termed as a ""red line"" in UN-brokered talks on ending the war, suggesting Damascus will never bow to international pressure for a political transition to end Assad's rule.The Syrian government rejects ""any external interference in political decisions regarding Syria´s future,"" said Muallem. ""Only Syrians have the right to make such decisions, whether now or in the future."" "
511,"MEXICO CITY: For a country still in mourning and counting its dead from Tuesday’s devastating earthquake, Frida the Navy rescue dog has emerged as a source of inspiration and pride in the search for survivors.Known for her custom-made doggy goggles and boots, the 7-year-old yellow Labrador has become a social media star, appearing on one man’s tattoo and the unofficial image of a 500-peso note. Some posts have wildly exaggerated her feats.In her career, Frida has located 12 people alive beneath the rubble plus more than 40 others dead, more than any other Mexican rescue dog, the Navy said. She has put her nose to work in disasters such as an earthquake in Ecuador last year, another one in southern Mexico two weeks ago, a landslide in Guatemala in 2015 and a Mexico City gas explosion in 2013.Her credits for the most recent disaster has not been tallied yet, said Navy Captain Armando Segura, because she is still busy trying to save lives. The 7.1-magnitude quake has killed nearly 300 people, and rescuers were still digging through some of the 52 buildings that collapsed in Mexico City alone.Frida has spent most of her efforts at a school in southern Mexico City where 19 school children and six adults died, but 11 more children were rescued.As one of the of the country’s most trusted institutions, the Mexican Navy has a wider role than most armadas, including a canine unit that has two other dogs, a pair of 18-month-old Belgian shepherds, Echo and Evil.Mexico’s army also has rescue dogs digging through the debris of damaged buildings, and a dog named Maya from the Jalisco state government was credited with finding two dead bodies on Thursday. The United States and Chile have also brought rescue dogs for the Mexican quake.None can match the fame of Frida.“It’s a source of pride to work with Frida. She’s a very, very special dog,” said Israel Arauz, her handler for the past two years.Frida only has about a year left as a life-scent dog before her olfactory senses are expected to decline, after which she will retire to live with Arauz."
512,"NEW YORK: Indian Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj on Saturday addressed the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and let loose a barrage of allegations aimed at Pakistan.Addressing the annual session, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj rejected allegations by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi at the world body earlier in the week in which he accused India of state-sponsored terrorism and violating human rights.Swaraj said Pakistanis should look at the progress India had made since the two countries emerged on independence from Britain in 1947.The Indian foreign minister claimed that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had talked about dialogue with Pakistan soon after assuming power, but the offer was spurned and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi should explain and answer why the offer was not accepted.""While India was engaged in efforts to fight poverty, Pakistan is engaged in fighting us,” alleged the Indian minister for foreign affairs. ""Why is it today India is a recognised IT superpower in the world, and Pakistan is recognised only as the pre-eminent export factory for terror?"" Sushma Swaraj alleged at the General Assembly.""We produced scholars, doctors, engineers. What have you produced? You have produced terrorists,"" she claimed.Swaraj also renewed calls for speeding up reforms at the UN to expand the Security Council to include more member — India is a claimant.PM Abbasi delivered a crisp and concise speech on his debut at the highest international diplomacyIndia has repeatedly accused Pakistan of training, arming and infiltrating militants into Kashmir, a claim that Pakistan has denied.Earlier on Thursday, Abbasi during his address at the UNGA highlighted the persistent human rights violations in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK), terming India's role in the region the ""most intense example of foreign occupation"".Highlighting the struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination, PM Abbasi said India refuses to implement the unanimous resolutions of the UN Security Council, which mandate a UN-supervised plebiscite to enable the people of occupied Kashmir to freely decide their destiny.Abbasi mentioned to the attendees that the UN charter has over time been eroding slowly, with unresolved conflicts taking a much larger part of the headlines than before, the rampant Indian aggression in occupied Kashmir a stark example of that. ""Instead, India has deployed nearly 700,000 troops in occupied Kashmir to suppress the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiris to exercise their right to self-determination. This is the most intense foreign military occupation in recent history,"" he said. He had also reiterated that Pakistan remains open to resuming a comprehensive dialogue with India to address all outstanding issues, especially Kashmir, and discuss measures to maintain peace and security."
513,"SITTWE: Relief agencies struggling to reach hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims displaced by strife in northwestern Myanmar are facing rising hostility from ethnic Rakhine Buddhists who accuse the United Nations and foreign aid groups of only helping Muslims.So far, the Myanmar government has only granted Red Cross organisations access to the area. The United Nations suspended its activities and evacuated non-critical staff after the government suggested it had supported Rohingya insurgents.Already battling against bad weather, tough terrain and obstructive bureaucracy, the Red Cross also ran into an angry mob, who believe the foreign aid agencies have ignored the suffering of Rakhine Buddhists in Myanmar’s poorest state.On Wednesday a mob in Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, tried to block a boat carrying International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) aid to the north, where attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug 25 prompted Myanmar‘s generals to order a sweeping counter-insurgency offensive.The mob was armed with sticks, knives and petrol bombs, and only dispersed after police fired rubber bullets.Four days earlier a Myanmar Red Cross truck was stopped and searched by Rakhine residents in Sittwe.“With heightened tensions in Rakhine State, humanitarian staff and private contractors are facing serious challenges in implementing life-saving activities,” said Pierre Peron, spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar.In the past month, 420,000 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh to avoid what the U.N. human rights chief has called ethnic cleansing.Foreign aid groups are now scaling up to help Bangladesh cope with a humanitarian disaster of biblical proportions.Back in Myanmar, a separate crisis is unfolding on multiple fronts, many of them much harder to reach.“Many ongoing humanitarian activities that existed before August 25th have still not resumed,” said Peron. “For the sake of vulnerable people in all communities in Rakhine State, urgent measures must be taken to allow vital humanitarian activities to resume.”In northern Rakhine, tens of thousands of people, most of them Rohingya, are displaced but haven’t crossed into Bangladesh.Closer to Sittwe, 140,000 Rohingya displaced by previous religious unrest are confined to squalid camps. They depend on foreign aid that has been severely restricted since Aug. 25.About 6,000 Buddhists have also fled to Sittwe, where they are cared for at monasteries by the government and Rakhine volunteers.Ethnic Rakhine have long complained that foreign aid agencies have given generously to Muslims while ignoring other equally needy people.“All people in Rakhine are suffering, but only Muslims get help,” said Htun Aung Kyaw, chief of the Arakan National Party (ANP).Rakhine residents of Sittwe interviewed by Reuters said they believed that UN estimates of refugee numbers were exaggerated and that Rohingya camps near the city faced no shortages.“They have more than enough,” said Kyaw Sein of Rakhine Alin Dagar, a Rakhine advocacy group in Sittwe.Kyaw Sein said she hadn’t visited the camps, but said in the past she had seen Muslims selling oil, rice and other aid in local markets.She said relations between the foreign aid groups and the Rakhine people had been poisoned by years of neglect and favouritism.“It’s difficult to say what they can do to win back our trust,” she said.Further eroding that trust are rumours that aid deliveries could be used to smuggle weapons to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the militant group behind the attacks on security forces last month and in October 2016.“The Rakhine have no weapons to protect themselves with,” said the ANP’s Htun Aung Kyaw. “That’s why they’re so terrified.”Such fears have been stoked by social media and by the discovery of World Food Program-branded biscuits at a suspected militant camp on July 30.They have also prompted the authorities to restrict humanitarian access to some Rohingya villages on security grounds, say aid workers.Htun Aung Kyaw predicted “bigger and bigger attacks”, especially if ARSA drew support from groups such as Daesh.Those concerns were echoed on Thursday by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Murphy, who warned of “a more significant terrorism problem” if the Rakhine crisis was not properly addressed.Murphy also criticized the Myanmar security forces for “a response that is disproportionate and failed to protect all local populations.”The United Nations rights body has called it “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing”, with reports of hundreds of Muslim villages razed and abuses by soldiers, police and Rakhine vigilantes.Even so, many people in Myanmar - not just Rakhine - appear to believe the military’s explanation: the Rohingya set their own houses alight before fleeing.Rakhine interviewed by Reuters said the Rohingya did this to win sympathy from aid groups, galvanize opposition in the Muslim world and ensure that nearby Rakhine houses burned down too.Some aid workers privately scoffed at such views, but they also admitted that their early failure to engage and understand the Rakhine has made their current work more difficult.Graziella Leite Piccoli, the ICRC’s regional spokesperson, said aid workers “should never be targeted”, and her colleagues were working to convince local communities that they are there to help everyone."
514,"KARACHI: The first phase of the second edition of players' development programme “Jazz Rising Stars” by the PSL franchise Lahore Qalandars received an overwhelming response from the aspiring Qalandars.Around 160,000 aspiring players appeared in trials at eight different venues.The total number of players’ registration was 302,173 while 159,935 players appeared in the trials, according to a Lahore Qalandars official. Last year, around 113,000 players participated in the programme.Trials were conducted at Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Lahore, Layyah, Sargodha, Rawalpindi, Azad Kashmir (Mirpur and Muzaffarabad), and Bahawalpur for the second edition of the programme. 128 players who were picked collectively are now part of eight different Rising Stars teams.The franchise, for the first time, added Kashmir to its players’ development programme and kicked it off from the picturesque valley of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).Around 35,000 aspiring Qalandars participated in trials collectively in Muzaffarabad and Mirpur. Trials were also conducted in seven different cities of Punjab to recruit eight teams for the Rising Stars tournament.The tournament, starting on September 26, will include teams from Azad Kashmir, Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Layyah, Bahawalpur, Lahore, Gujranwala, and Faisalabad.“Our priority at every venue was to select players on the basis of merit,” said CEO of Lahore Qalandars, Atif Rana.“I didn’t interfere in any selection-related matter,"" he said. ""Selectors, led by Aaqib Javed, were fully empowered to pick the squad on the basis of their own judgement of [the players'] skills.” The trials were not held for mere formality. “We have found numerous talented players, especially fast bowlers and fast bowling all-rounders,” said Lahore Qalandars’ Director of Cricket Aqib Javed told Geo.tv.“We have spotted at least 20 bowlers who bowl at over 87mph and have great prospects,"" Aaqib said. ""They can serve Pakistan cricket in the future.” Haris Rauf and Salman Irshad, both fast bowlers, spotted in Gujranwala and Azad Kashmir respectively are among the talented bowlers spotted by the Lahore Qalandars.“This [Rising Stars programme] is the best thing [to have happened] in my life,” Aaqib said. ""There were many challenges but I am glad that we defied all odds and delivered something to Pakistan cricket...I am very proud to be a part of it.” With the first phase of Jazz Rising Stars now concluded, the selected players are now set for the second stage of the programme. The eight-team tournament will commence in Muzaffarabad on September 26.Of the 128 players participating in the Rising Stars tournament, 16 will be picked to represent the Lahore Qalandars Rising Stars team. The team will travel to Australia to participate in a triangular tournament in Sydney. Four of the top performers will get the opportunity to be part of the Lahore Qalandars’ PSL squad."
515,"LONDON: Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday that he had requested for a commission to be formed to probe Model Town incident.Commission’s report belongs to the government besides the matter is in the court and should not be discussed, he added.He remarked that he was not aware of any session in London, adding that the question of attending the session would arise had he known about the session.Shehbaz, who reached London on Saturday, said that he has come to check up on the health of his sister-in-law, Begum Kulsoom Nawaz.Other family members such as Salman Shehbaz have accompanied Punjab CM on his trip to London.During the visit, Shehbaz is expected to meet the former prime minister and his brother Nawaz Sharif among other party leaders. Finance Minister Ishaq is also expected to be a part of the meeting.Speaking about the meeting, Shehbaz said that all relevant issues will be discussed with Nawaz.Meanwhile, the top party leadership has gathered in London today for a consultative meeting, which will be chaired by Nawaz Sharif and will bring under discussion the country’s political situation and court cases against the Sharif family, among other matters.On September 21, the LHC ordered the Punjab government to make public the judicial inquiry report into the Model Town killings.The order was read out by Justice Mazahir Ali Akbar Naqvi while hearing a petition by the families of those injured in the 2014 clashes with police in Lahore to make the inquiry report public. At least 14 people were killed and 100 others injured in the police action. The petitions have been filed by the families of victims killed in Model Town during an ‘anti-encroachment’ operation conducted by police against the PAT headquarters. Earlier in the day, Shehbaz Sharif has rejected reports of a rift in Sharif family, emphasising his unrelenting support for his brother, the ousted former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.I will always stand with Nawaz Sharif, said the Punjab CMWhile speaking to assembly members on Friday, Shehbaz clarified there is no conflict in the Sharif family.“Those trying to create misunderstandings, note this: I will always stand with Nawaz Sharif,” he said, stressing that he has always been and will always be sincere with his brother.He also warned against the spread of such rumours and negative politics.‘No two opinions about Nawaz’s return’"

518,"UNITED NATIONS: Maleeha Lodhi — Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN — during her address to the General Assembly early Sunday morning said India is the mother of terrorism in South Asia.Voicing her rebuttal to Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj's comment that Pakistan is a ""pre-eminent export factory for terror"", Lodhi claimed that India's posture is that of a predator.Lodhi also emphasised that India — a nation ruled by fascist ideology — should stop supporting and aiding terrorism and related activities across the border.""Indian leaders have Muslim blood on their hands,"" she said.Pakistan calls for an inquiry into the war crimes perpetrated by India in Occupied Kashmir (IoK), the Pakistani UN representative stated, noting that forceful occupation of the troubled, conflict-ridden region is illegal.""Kashmir is not part of India,"" Lodhi stressed, adding that the global community needs to collectively make India stop violating the ceasefire arrangement between the two countries.Alleging that Swaraj slandered against Pakistan in her comments earlier in the day, Lodhi said that Pakistan desires to resolve problems through constructive talks, which are conditional to India doing away with its policy of terrorism.Ambassador Lodhi said the UN should define terrorism, but said it should include ""state terrorism"". ""The state terrorism which the Indian National Security Adviser (Ajit Doval) has boasted is being sponsored by India's spy agencies in Pakistan's Balochistan province in what he called a 'double squeeze' strategy.""The UN representative said [convicted Indian spy] Kulbhushan Jadhav confessed to subversion in Pakistan, causing terror in the country, and receiving India's aid for the plans.Swaraj rejected allegations Abbasi in which he accused India of state-sponsored terrorismDeploring the Indian minister's attempt to denigrate Pakistan's founding father, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the Pakistani envoy said, ""All I can say about India's current political luminaries is that they belong to a political organisation that has the blood of thousands of Muslims of Gujarat on its hands.""India has fought wars with or in all of its neighbouring countries, Lodhi said. She also mentioned that the 'largest democracy' is also ""the world's largest hypocrisy"".""It is ruled by a government in which a racist and fascist ideology is firmly embedded. The leadership of this government emanates from the RSS, the same extremist group, which is accused of assassinating Mahatma Gandhi,"" ambassador Lodhi said. ""It is a government which has appointed a fanatic as the chief minister of India's largest state whose rallying cry to his mobs was: 'If they kill one Hindu, we will kill 100 Muslim'. It is a government, which has allowed the lynching of Muslims."""
519,"LONDON: Six people were believed to have been injured on Saturday — with their injuries ""not life-threatening or life-changing"" — after a group of males reportedly sprayed a noxious substance in a number of attacks in an area around a shopping centre in east London, police said.The incident was not being treated as terror-related, a police spokesman said.The attacks occurred near the Stratford Centre in Stratford, police said.Earlier, they had said the incident took place around the bigger Westfield shopping centre which is nearby.“A number of people have been reported injured at different locations - believed to be six people. We await further details,” London’s Metropolitan Police said in a statement.One male was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, the statement said.The incident occurred around 8 PM (12 AM PST, Sunday), it said. Photographs posted online showed police officers crouching over an apparent victim of the attack as they treated him.The number of acid attacks has increased in Britain in recent years, linked to robberies and gang-related violence.The government said in July it would look at tougher punishments for people who attack others using acid."
520,"This week, a famous Pakistan man congratulated another famous Pakistani man in full view of the world on Twitter. He called him righteous. And commended him for the glorious achievement of gaining 4,000 votes in his first attempt at a by-election. The other two candidates polled close to 100,000 votes in total.This week, a famous Pakistani man thought it amusing to call a Pakistani girl activist posing with an Indian female actor a great actor too. He fumed over her recent admission into an Oxbridge college and called her a “Western plant”. Quaid-e-Azam also studied at London’s Lincoln’s Inn. Had he lived then, this famous Pakistani man from today would probably have condemned him for studying abroad too. Nearly 1,500 people ‘liked’ his social media post.A famous Pakistan woman wore a dress on a warm September night in New York City. At some point, she stepped outside a venue for a smoke with a famous Indian man. Somebody clicked photographs. All hell broke loose.The first famous man, Hamza Ali Abbasi, is a Pakistani actor with over four million followers on Facebook and close to 700,000 more on Twitter. The famous man he supports is Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, who has a $10 million American bounty on his head and is alleged to be the co-founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba.Abbasi, while being a national heartthrob, is also an amateur political commentator on a private TV channel and on social media. His posts are usually vociferously anti-India and will probably help his long-term political ambitions. Yet even for him, the endorsement of the Milli Muslim League (the JuD’s new political avatar) is OTT.On Facebook, the famous man venting against Malala Yousafzai was model Syed Abbas Jaffrey. You may not instantly recognise the name but a flowing beard and long hair distinguish this in-demand male model from his counterparts. Jaffrey posted a photograph of Priyanka Chopra and Malala Yousafzai meeting in New York captioning it with: “Today Priyanka Chopra met a great actress”.It’s not something I haven’t seen before. Pakistan’s only living Nobel Laureate is constantly berated on social media. But it is tedious when every second celebrity sees himself as an entitled commentator. These men are icons for young and impressionable fans who applaud and copy them. But, instead of spreading the light, they darken the room. There is hardly a single international achiever from Pakistan that we acknowledge or believe in. If the world respects them, we hate them. A nation who can’t own their own achievers is poor indeed.Which brings me to the famous Pakistani woman, spotted with the equally famous Indian man Ranbir Kapoor, who overnight seems to have become the celebrity everyone loves to hate. And all because of a summer dress on a warm New York night, a cigarette and a man who is from the wrong side of the border. And yes, nearly everyone has assumed that where there is smoke, there must be fire.Mahira Khan has been Pakistan’s sweetheart since she stepped into the limelight as a VJ. But it was really Humsafar that catapulted her into the public eye. She has been every director’s first choice — and has upcoming films with Shoaib Mansoor (Verna), Bilal Lashari (Maula Jutt 2) or Meenu Gaur and Farjad Nabi (Saat Din Mohabbat In). Yet, in some ways, Khan’s sweetheart image has been both her greatest strength and her biggest downfall. Being Pakistan’s most celebrated heroine means she has invariably been called upon to play variations of herself in most roles. The lines between her real life persona and her on-screen one are often blurred.The Pakistani public is cruel. We are quicker at detraction than praise. While Mahira Khan got a whole lot of love from Pakistan throughout her career, in the last few days the hate and vitriol been heaped on her has been in equal proportion. So let’s address the issue. Is this about the little white dress? Partially, but hardly. Dresses are worn on the Pakistani red carpet, at parties throughout Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad and on the catwalk aplenty. With plunging necklines, backless scoops and more. Clearly there seems to be a sense that others can do it but Pakistan’s sweetheart can’t.Is this about the cigarette? Partially, but not fully. You can see women smoking in any restaurant or cafe you walk into in urban Pakistan. Though Pakistanis like to paint women who smoke as immoral or “Westernised” in actuality narghilea or traditional hookah smoking by women is prevalent in many Muslim countries, including rural Pakistan. My maternal grandmother smoked all her life. I don’t remember anyone telling her it was too Western. But once again, it is Mahira Khan being bound by her own celebrity image — nice girls don’t.But like it or not, what this is really about is Ranbir Kapoor, India and Pakistan and about our girl and their boy. Nira Yuval-Davis argues that women are constructed as carriers of tradition, nation and national honour. So when they fraternise with the male “enemy”, we feel like the subaltern nation.If Hamza Ali Abbasi had been photographed in shorts with Priyanka Chopra, we would have celebrated the event with streamers and a military band. People (at least those with access to social media) may not be happy with Mahira Khan smoking or wearing a short dress — they are rather more unhappy because she is doing both of these in the company of an Indian man.So while the response to Hamza Ali Abbasi was divided and to Syed Abbas Jaffrey supportive, the overwhelming reaction to Mahira Khan’s smoke-up has been dark and disgusting. From accusations of supposed hickeys (apparently scars from a cyst removal) to lurid descriptions of imagined sexual encounters with Ranbir Kapoor to religious denouncements, a few pictures of a girl in a white cotton dress have sent the morality brigade into a fury.Every man has an opinion – be it accusations of perceived betrayal or sexually disparaging references. The heights of condemnation and the lows of language are both startling and far too vulgar to repeat. A shooting star has become a falling star.This unbridled moral outrage has happened before to female celebrities in Pakistan (think Neelam Muneer) and will happen again. But we should all vocally deplore it.Is this the end of Mahira Khan’s career? I hope not and think not. She may lose some endorsement deals and advertisers may not flock to her for a bit. But she should take this opportunity to redefine herself as an artist. So for once, I hope Mahira Khan will not blame herself or second guess herself. It’s not her fault that she lives in a country where male stars can support a terrorist and get away with it but a girl can’t smoke a cigarette without being savagely reviled.The writer is a journalist based in London and works with the BBC World Service as a broadcaster. Twitter: @fifiharoonThis article was originally published in The News"
521,"BERLIN: Germans vote in a national election today that is likely to see Chancellor Angela Merkel win a historic fourth term and a far-right party enter parliament for the first time in more than half a century.Merkel’s conservative bloc is on track to remain the largest group in parliament, opinion polls showed before the vote, but a fracturing of the political landscape may well make it harder for her to form a ruling coalition than previously.With as many as a third of Germans undecided in the run-up to the election, Merkel and her main rival, centre-left challenger Martin Schulz of the Social Democrats (SPD), urged them on Saturday to get out and vote.“We want to boost your motivation so that we can still reach many, many people,” the chancellor, 63, said in Berlin before heading north to her constituency for a final round of campaigning.In regional votes last year, Merkel’s conservatives suffered setbacks to the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which profited from resentment at her 2015 decision to leave German borders open to over one million migrants.Those setbacks made Merkel, a pastor’s daughter who grew up in Communist East Germany, wonder if she should even run for re-election.But with the migrant issue under control this year, she has bounced back and thrown herself into a punishing campaign schedule, presenting herself as an anchor of stability in an uncertain world.Visibly happier, Merkel campaigned with renewed conviction: a resolve to re-tool the economy for the digital age, to head off future migrant crises, and to defend a Western order shaken by Donald Trump’s US election victory last November.Both Merkel and Schulz worry that a low turnout could work in favor of smaller parties, especially the AfD, which is expected to enter the national parliament for the first time. On Friday, Schulz described the AfD as “gravediggers of democracy.”An INSA poll published by Bild newspaper on Saturday showed sliding support for Merkel’s conservatives, who dropped two percentage points to 34 per cent, and the SPD, down one point to 21 per cent — both now joined in an unwieldy “grand coalition”.The anti-immigrant AfD, rose two points to 13 percent — a result the poll showed would make it the third largest party.Should she win a fourth term, Merkel will join the late Helmut Kohl, her mentor who reunified Germany, and Konrad Adenauer, who led Germany’s rebirth after World War Two, as the only post-war chancellors to win four national elections.The AfD’s expected entry into the national parliament will herald the beginning of a new era in German politics that will see more robust debate and a departure from the steady, consensus-based approach that has marked the post-war period.Coalition building after the election will be an arduous process that could take months as all potential partners are unsure whether they really want to share power with Merkel.All major parties refuse to work with the AfD.Electoral arithmetic might push Merkel to renew her grand coalition with the SPD, or she might opt for a three-way alliance with the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and environmentalist Greens."
522,"NEW YORK: Charles Bradley — the soul singer whose robust, brassy voice won him stardom in his final years after decades of scraping along — died Saturday from cancer. He was 68.Bradley — who earlier this year had triumphantly returned to the stage where he thanked his fans and God — died surrounded by family, friends, and bandmates at his home in Brooklyn, his publicist said.""Mr. Bradley was truly grateful for all the love he's received from his fans and we hope his message of love is remembered and carried on,"" a statement said.Born in Florida, Bradley as a teenager in New York discovered soul legend James Brown at the Apollo Theater. He eventually found a career as a Brown impersonator, emulating the late singer's glittery outfits and forceful stage persona.But even with a rich voice that evokes soul greats such as Otis Redding, Bradley enjoyed little mainstream success on his own until the New York soul label Daptones signed him in the 2000s.He released his debut solo album in 2011 and soon became a critical sensation. Changes — his latest album — figured on several music magazines' lists of 2016's top albums.Bradley drew an enthusiastic younger crowd as he was booked for leading festivals including Coachella and Glastonbury."
523,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia is celebrating the 87th anniversary of its foundation this weekend with a big programme of concerts and performances, including a pageant operetta on Saturday evening which allowed women to enter the King Fahd International Stadium in Riyadh for the first time.The festivities are part of a government move to boost national pride and improve quality of life for Saudis.Also on offer is a concert in the Red Sea city of Jeddah featuring 11 Arab musicians, plus fireworks, air acrobatics and traditional folk dance shows.“It is the first time I have come to the stadium and I feel like more of a Saudi citizen. Now I can go everywhere in my country,” said 25-year-old Sultana, green and white flags painted on both cheeks as she entered the complex with her girlfriends.“God willing, tomorrow women will be permitted bigger and better things like driving and travel.”Several thousand families entered the stadium — where top football matches are held — through a separate gate from single men. They cheered, flashed peace signs and waved green Saudi flags.A toddler wore a shirt that said in English “I (heart) Saudi Arabia” while a little girl donned a green dress with the faces of King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed, printed on it. A young man recited a poem praising the 82-year-old monarch.The events are the latest entertainment sponsored by the government as part of the Vision 2030 reform programme launched two years ago to diversify the economy away from oil, create whole new sectors to employ young citizens and open up Saudis’ cloistered lifestyles.However in a country that adheres to a strict brand of Islam, which bans gender mixing, concerts and cinemas, the plan’s seemingly anodyne goals to empower women, promote sports and invest in entertainment have been criticised. Saudi rulers are also starting to reform areas once the exclusive domain of the clergy, such as education and the law, and have promoted elements of national identity that have no religious component or pre-date Islam.They have increased National Day celebrations that were previously attacked by clerics as undermining religious feeling, and are promoting heritage sites, like Nabatean rock temples, once seen as embarrassing in the land of Islam.King Salman marked the holiday on Twitter, writing: “The kingdom will remain a bulwark for those who love benevolence, their religion and their country.”The operetta on Saturday told the story of the founding of the modern Saudi state by Ibn Saud, King Salman’s father, following a series of territorial conquests and eight years before the discovery of oil opened the way to making the new kingdom the world’s top oil exporter.The performance, which praised the kingdom’s religious and martial past while looking ahead to more development, featured horses, camels and hundreds of men dancing with swords and drums. An unveiled woman and two dozen girls joined them onstage.Pyrotechnics, dancing fountains and lasers elicited cheers from the crowd which snapped photos on their smartphones.The final segment featured pictures of Crown Prince Mohammed — visiting troops, meeting world leaders, watching a football match — whose face has become nearly as ubiquitous as his father’s since he became heir to the throne in June.There is widespread speculation, denied by officials, that King Salman intends to abdicate to his son, who already dominates economic, diplomatic and domestic policy.Saudi flags and green billboards, often bearing the faces of both men, have gone up across Riyadh this week, and at night skyscrapers are flooded in green light — the national colour.Companies from telecoms operators to furniture stores have launched patriotic-themed marketing campaigns offering discounts for the holiday weekend.Um Abdulrahm al-Shihri, who travelled 1,100 km from the northwestern city of Tabuk, to enter the stadium, said she hoped in the future women would be able to attend football matches and other public festivities which are traditionally the reserve of men.“You cannot imagine how happy we are today ... We feel that there is openness towards us,” she said, wearing the black niqab covering all but her eyes. “Women are at all levels now — women are now (representatives) in the Shura council, women are now doctors, women are now in big positions. So why shouldn’t we join the men in things that matter to our nation?”The General Entertainment Authority, the government agency organising the National Day festivities, expects some 1.5 million Saudis to attend events in 17 cities over four days.Vision 2030 reforms are intended to capture up to a quarter of the $20 billion currently spent overseas by Saudis, who are accustomed to travelling abroad to see shows and visit amusement parks in nearby tourist hub Dubai or further afield. This weekend’s events, though, are free to the public.Issa Daghiri, attending the operetta in Riyadh with his wife and children, said he was encouraged by the acceptance of families at the stadium, which holds about 40,000 spectators.“We had hoped for this for a while and now the opportunity has come,” he said. “Each year that passes, the kingdom develops.”"

""Naturally as part of this, we are talking to a number of people.""Marshall, the former head of the Hampshire police force in southern England, added the ICC would ""not comment further on an ongoing investigation"", a point emphasised by a spokeswoman for world cricket's ruling authority when contacted by AFP.The ICC's statement came just a day after Sri Lanka Cricket said that 40 contracted national team players, including captains Dinesh Chandimal and Upul Tharanga, had signed a petition to SLC calling for an immediate inquiry into ""shocking"" allegations made by Pramodya Wickremasinghe.A former Sri Lanka pace bowler and ex-national selector, Wickremasinghe gave an interview to a local television station where he made allegations concerning ""unnatural match patterns"" and player selections while blaming the current management for the team's poor performance.The SLC statement said current players regarded Wickremasinghe's comments as ""disparaging and hurtful"".The statement said the players had refuted the allegations as ""totally baseless"" and added that they performed for their ""motherland...with a 200 percent commitment"".It concluded by saying the players had urged SLC to initiate an immediate inquiry by summoning Wickremasinghe as they had all been slandered by his ""diabolic allegations"".However, SLC did not say if it had launched such an inquiry.Sri Lanka recently suffered the embarrassment of losing all nine international matches in a home campaign against India.Virat Kohli's visitors took the Test series 3-0 and then won a one-day international series 5-0 before triumphing in the lone Twenty20 international of their tour by seven wickets in Colombo earlier this month.Wickremasinghe's allegations are not the first to swirl around the Sri Lanka team.In July, former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga — who led the Islanders to the 1996 World Cup title — demanded an inquiry into the team's defeat by India in the 2011 final in Mumbai.Sri Lanka made four changes to their side against India from the one that beat New Zealand in the semi-finals, with Angelo Mathews, Rangana Herath, Ajanta Mendis and Chamara Silva making way for Thisara Perera, Suraj Randiv, Nuwan Kulasekara and Chamara Kapugedera.They made 274 in their 50 overs, including a hundred from star batsman Mahela Jayawardene, before losing by six wickets.""When we lost, I was distressed and I had a doubt,"" Ranatunga said in July.""We must investigate what happened to Sri Lanka at the 2011 World Cup final. I cannot reveal everything now, but one day I will. There must be an inquiry."""

526,"Actor Naseeruddin Shah once said Bollywood ""films that should never have been made are being re-made"".David Dhawan, who directed a series of crass comedies in the 90's probably doesn't agree, because he's made the same film twice. Once in 1997 with Salman Khan and 20 years later - in the Bollywood tradition of nepotism - with his own son in the lead.To Varun Dhawan's credit, he is the best thing about a film that simply doesn’t hold up. Twenty years ago, ""Judwaa"" barely passed the test of any comedy. Watch it again today and it grates on your nerves.The director makes cosmetic attempts at keeping up with the times. The film’s location changes to London, which explains the deletion of the song “East or West, India is the best.”In “Judwaa 2”, India is shown only in flashbacks when a smuggler kidnaps one of newborn twins to extract revenge on the father.The family moves to London, unaware that Raja (Varun Dhawan) is alive and is being raised in a fisherman’s colony in Mumbai.He runs away to London after an altercation with a criminal, leading to a comedy of errors. While Raja is boisterous and always ready for a fight, his twin brother Prem is meek and avoids confrontation. They both fall in love with women whose only role in the film is be arm candy.The director milks the same joke over and over again. Prem and Raja mirror each other’s actions - so when one is kissing, so is the other; when one lands a blow, so does the other. This leads to many slapstick moments and is funny just once, after which it gets repetitive.There is a host of ensemble actors who add nothing to the film’s humour quotient, and saunter in and out of the screen with no purpose.""Judwaa 2"" is already treading on thin ice, given it never had strong material to begin with. Thankfully, as in the original, it has a leading man with enough screen presence to manage scenes that would be too outlandish otherwise."
527,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s public prosecutor issued an arrest warrant on Saturday for a Twitter user who called for anyone who supports women driving to be killed, days after a royal decree ended a long-time ban on women taking the wheel.The Twitter user, who was not named, was alleged to have referred to men who support women driving as “cuckolds who should be killed,” according to state-linked Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.The prosecutor’s announcement comes two days after a separate arrest warrant was issued for a man who threatened in a video clip posted online to attack women drivers.Many Saudis welcomed Tuesday’s announcement by King Salman lifting the ban by next year, but others expressed opposition online or in quiet conversations after decades of support for the policy by prominent clerics.Manal al-Sharif was imprisoned for nine days after posting a video of herself on YouTube and Facebook driving her car in Saudi Arabia In the statement, the prosecutor vowed to monitor for threats of abuse and pursue cases against those who “incite attacks against society and violations of the rights of others”."
528,"LOS ANGELES: Onetime “Trial of the Century” defendant OJ Simpson could be freed as early as Sunday from prison in Nevada, where he has been held since 2008 for a botched robbery, but the time and place of his release remain secret, his plans largely unknown.Simpson, 70, won his freedom from a Nevada parole board in July after nine years behind bars, at a hearing that did not take into account his 1990s trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a friend, Ron Goldman.The onetime football star turned actor and TV pitchman nicknamed “The Juice” during his playing career was found not guilty in 1995 following that sensational, 13-month trial in Los Angeles, which was televised live daily, transfixing much of the nation.A civil court jury subsequently found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims’ families, a judgment that remains largely unpaid.The Nevada Department of Corrections, seeking to avoid the kind of media frenzy that often accompanies Simpson, has declined to say exactly when and where he would be released.A department spokeswoman warned media not to try to chase his vehicle from the prison gates, saying officials could postpone the release for weeks if necessary to avoid “risk to the community” from such a frenzy.Also unclear is the former star athlete’s ultimate destination. He told parole board members he hopes to move to Florida, where he has friends and family, a plan that must be approved by probation authorities there.During the parole hearing, Simpson joked that he was willing to stay in Nevada, but “I‘m sure you don’t want me here.”His Las Vegas-based attorney, Malcom LaVergne, reiterated the Florida plans during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” program on Friday, adding that his client was looking forward to spending time with family members, eating steak and seafood and buying an iPhone.LaVergne could not be reached for comment by Reuters.Florida corrections officials say they had not received a parole transfer request for Simpson and had not been contacted by their counterparts in Nevada.Simpson is a native of California, born in San Francisco, and played his final years as a pro football player for that city’s team, the 49ers. He lived in Los Angeles at the time of the murders.But California corrections officials say he has not filed papers to live in that state either."
529,"Despite all my efforts, I must admit my inability in spotting the underlying logic of Pakistan’s Afghan policy. If the objectives of the policy were to check the influence of India in Afghanistan, then we need to admit that the influence has increased from what it was in the 1980s.If the objectives were to have a superior position in bilateral relations, in that case too the policy has yielded no fruits. Afghanistan has more anger and resentment against Pakistan than it did in the 1970s. Pakistan’s influence is waning in Afghanistan to the degree that people like Gulbaddin Hekmatyar are now unable to utter anything positive about Pakistan. Lastly, if the objectives of Pakistan’s Afghan policy were to ensure that Afghanistan’s territory should not be used against Pakistan in that too the policy backfired. Compared to the 1970s the intensity and frequency of such violations from Afghanistan has increased. So if the policy failed to achieve any of its stated or projected objectives, why does it continue?Equally unfortunate and illogical is the story on the other side of the border. Afghanistan’s policy towards Pakistan has also backfired in many ways. If the objectives of Afghanistan in its ties with India were to force and dictate Pakistan, it is apparent that Afghanistan has failed. Rather, the country lost the support and cooperation of Pakistan. Every negative move from Afghanistan is paid in the same currency from Pakistan. By keeping a negative stance towards Pakistan, Afghanistan has not achieved any success in improving conditions for peace or in defeating the Taliban or even in rapprochement efforts with the Taliban. In fact, now, beside the Taliban, they have to face Daesh as well.Afghanistan used to blame Pakistan for its alleged support to militants; it has now added Russian and Iran to this list too. So, it is obvious that annoying Pakistan and getting closer to India did not bring much good to Afghanistan. In the end, we are faced with the same policy dilemma and question in Afghanistan too. If their policy towards Pakistan is defunct, why does it still continue?Pakistan seems to be ignoring the fact that without a stable government in Afghanistan, no one there can ensure that its land will not be used against Pakistan. Afghanistan too seems to ignore the fact that any government in Afghanistan that establishes such love affairs with India would never find much support in Pakistan. In the same way, policymakers at both sides of the border don’t see that Pakistan’s peace and stability is impossible without peace in Afghanistan – and vice versa. Pakistani policymakers do not realise that Afghanistan in its worst set of policies would never be as dangerous as India; and Afghan policymakers can’t see that even the most favoured relations with India cannot replace relations with Pakistan.There are some attitude issues too. Pakistan is always ready to absorb pressure and policy responses from both the US and China. But when it comes to Afghanistan, Pakistan doesn’t allow a single bitter word without response. The same is the case with Afghanistan, which accepts bitter dictates from the US and even from Russia, the UK and Germany. At times, it seems that the Afghan leadership compromises their national interests, here and there, even in favour of Indian policy. But when it comes to Pakistan, every Afghan leader sees it as an insult to accommodate or compromise even on minor issues.Both our countries need to adjust to each other in a mature manner. If we think that Afghanistan has worked against our interests many times, we should also accept the fact that the US has been far more fickle with us. Why have we never planned to retaliate on that? If we admit that Pakistan may have interfered in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, then our Afghan brothers must also ask themselves if any such interventions equal the meddling by the USSR and US. Why has the Afghan leadership never thought about the same policy response for Russia and the US that they have reserved for Pakistan?Similarly, if Pakistan is upset that, despite the goodwill extended by it, Afghanistan has ended up establishing close relations with India, the story is the same in the case of Iran. But that doesn’t mean Pakistan tries to ensure a pro-Pakistani government in Iran. In this case too, the story is the same on the other side of the border. The Afghans say that Pakistan committed blunders in its Afghan policy that proved hazardous to Afghanistan, but then they also need to calculate the number of blunders from the USSR and US in their dealings with Afghanistan and the consequent tragedies for Afghanistan. If Russia and Iran are now seeing the Taliban as an asset, is that due to the Pakistan factor or because of US installations in Afghanistan? And, lastly, if it is about attitude, why is all condemnation reserved for Pakistan and none against others, like the US.The fact really is that Pakistan has no policy for Afghanistan and Afghanistan has no policy for Pakistan. All we see is mere ‘responses’ and ‘adjustments’. Pakistan changes this so-called policy every day, as does Afghanistan. In Pakistan, if one policy on Afghanistan suits one institution or leader, it panics the other. Governments on both sides of the border are not free in policy formulation as they have to sustain and absorb a number of conflicting internal and external interests and pressures.It is unfortunate that for the last 16 years Pakistan’s policy for Afghanistan has not been based on merit but seen through the lenses of the US. Afghanistan too has adopted the American perspective on Pakistan in the formulation of its Pakistan policy. Pakistan had been under the illusion that if its policy could win over the US, it would be accepted by Afghanistan as well. Afghanistan has also been careless in its moves regarding Pakistan, thinking that if anything were to go wrong, the US would be there to handle it. This led to a state of affairs where both neighbours constantly turned to the US for their complaints against each other. All this has now resulted in a complete disaster, with the US equally annoyed with both Pakistan and Afghanistan. US President Donald Trump has warned Pakistan while also distancing the US from its reconstruction pledge for Afghanistan.All this points towards an even bigger disaster: that the US is now completely confused over Afghanistan. Pakistan and Afghanistan don’t have any meaningful policy on each other, and now the US too seems to lack one on either country. The Americans have no clear plan for Afghanistan; they are not clear on how to deal with the Taliban and they are confused on whether to stay on or leave Afghanistan. One thing is obvious: if no clear and real solution is planned and implemented in Afghanistan, the resultant disaster could be the disaster.If any such thing happens it will not directly disturb the US, Iran, Russia or even China. But Afghanistan and Pakistan will definitely face its direct and unavoidable consequences. This is when Afghanistan and Pakistan need to sit together and understand that if Pakistan fails to ensure Afghanistan’s stability and Afghanistan fails to address Pakistan’s reservations, then both countries will face unimaginable loss. Traditional diplomatic tactics are useless in the current situation. Both countries must sit together and accept their wrongdoings. It will be even better if China helps the process – not as arbitrator but as guarantor.We can only hope that the leadership of both countries follow the path of reason, and refrain from cynicism, for the larger interests of both nations and for the millions of people residing in this region. One hopes that Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s visit to Kabul will help towards this new beginning.— Originally appeared on The NewsThe writer works for Geo TV.Email: [email protected] com.pk"

We need to bring our house in order to prevent facing embarrassment on an international level.”Following Asif’s statements, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi seconded the foreign minister's remarks regarding 'in-house cleaning' and agreed with the point of view that our own house needs to be cleaned first.However, members of the opposition, along with former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, came down hard on Asif for his 'anti-Pakistan' comments. "
532,"A Libyan militant accused of leading the September 11, 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Benghazi that left the US ambassador and three others dead goes on trial Monday.Ahmed Abu Khattala is charged with 18 counts of murder, supporting terrorists and related charges in the trial in the federal district court in Washington, three years after he was captured in a commando raid and sent by ship to the United States.Khattala, about 46, was the commander of an extremist militia in Benghazi, Ansar al-Sharia, which undertook the deadly raid on the US compound in the eastern port city.According to the indictment, he led a group of about 20 militants storming the compound. They set buildings on fire, including one that contained ambassador Christopher Stevens and a foreign service offices, killing them. Shortly afterward they killed two US security contractors in an attack on a CIA outpost near the mission compound.The attack shocked Americans but turned into a bitter political fight in which Republicans sought in a multi-year investigation to pin the blame for the popular diplomat´s death on then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ahead of her planned run for the presidency. The trial of Khattala, who has pleaded not guilty, was stalled by a steady stream of motions challenging the way he was brought to the United States and the use of evidence from two interrogations.After his capture he was not spirited quickly back to the United States by jet, but placed on a navy ship for two weeks.There he first underwent five days of interrogation by intelligence agents.Then he was interrogated by a team from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for several days.In August the Washington court ruled against his lawyers´ motion to suppress whatever he told his interrogators as evidence, because his rights to remain silent, know the charges against him and have a lawyer present were violated.His lawyers also argued that the lengthy 13 day trip by ship back to the United States was part of a scheme to extract information from him without legal protections.But in his August 16 ruling, Judge Christopher Cooper ruled that in fact FBI agents had repeatedly advised Khattala of his ""Miranda"" rights to have a lawyer present and to remain silent, and had ""knowingly and intelligently"" waived them.""Abu Khattala was treated humanely and courteously: He was given breaks every hour or two, and offered snacks and refreshments,"" the judge said.""The sheer number of times Abu Khattala waived his Miranda rights -- once in writing and twice verbally on each typical interview day -- is further evidence of the waivers´ voluntariness."""
533,"RAWALPINDI: Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa left for Kabul on Sunday, according to the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army's media wing. Gen Bajwa will hold a meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and other senior civilian and military officials during the day-long visit, the army said further.The two countries often trade accusations of fomenting militancy and terrorism within each other's borders, as well as cross-border attacks. Pakistan blames Afghanistan for hosting several terrorist groups that use its soil against Pakistan, and vice versa. Last week, Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan cannot take responsibility for peace and security in Afghanistan, adding that effective border management with Afghanistan is imperative to stop infiltration of terrorists.The minister blamed India for carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan through AfghanistanSpeaking at the Asia Society seminar in New York on Wednesday, the minister said the US cannot succeed in Afghanistan by waging war. Asif said that no one desires peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan, but that a number of Afghan leaders want to continue status quo for their vested interests.The minister blamed India for carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan through Afghanistan, saying that more than 66 terrorist organisations are active inside India.According to the ISPR, Pakistan and Afghanistan also held bilateral military cooperation meetingsAround two weeks ago, at a tripartite forum, officials of the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed their commitment to eliminate Daesh from the region. At the meeting held in Kabul, they agreed on information sharing, complementary efforts and enhanced cooperation, according to the ISPR.Moreover, on the sidelines of the tripartite meeting, the Pak-Afghan military delegations held a bilateral meeting and discussed cross-border attacks, counter-terrorism, coordinated actions on the respective sides along the border and exchange of detainees."
534,"SAN FRANCISCO: Uber Technologies Inc co-founder Travis Kalanick said he had appointed two new directors, a surprise move that publicly reignited a board battle over the role of the ousted former chief executive.Kalanick’s move on Friday sought to pre-empt a move by new Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi to restructure the board and gain greater control, a person familiar with the co-founder’s decision said.Uber said in a statement on Friday the company was surprised by Kalanick’s action.Company investors are divided over whether Kalanick should remain on the board and whether he should be allowed to name two other directors.Benchmark Capital, which had pressured Kalanick to resign as CEO in the wake of several governance scandals, did not respond to a request for comment.Khosrowshahi is scrambling to portray Uber as a reformed company that is turning a page on concerns including sexual harassment claims and a U.S. bribery probe. Investors have described diluting Kalanick’s power as a necessary step on the path to making amends.Kalanick, still one of the largest shareholders, said in a statement he had appointed former Xerox Chief Executive Ursula Burns and former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain as directors.“I am appointing these seats now in light of a recent board proposal to dramatically restructure the board and significantly alter the company’s voting rights. It is therefore essential that the full board be in place for proper deliberation to occur, especially with such experienced board members as Ursula and John,” he said. He did not specify the proposals he opposed.Uber had nine directors before Kalanick’s Friday appointments. The person familiar with the matter said that Kalanick acted after Khosrowshahi had outlined a plan to directors, which is scheduled to be voted on October 3, that would give him control of four board seats in addition to his own on a panel that now has 11 directors.Khosrowshahi’s plan calls for transferring one of the two Kalanick-controlled positions to SoftBank Group Corp, which is considering an investment in Uber, the source said. Khosrowshahi effectively could put a person of his choosing in the other seat, as well as three other existing ones, according to the source. A third of directors also would be elected each year under the plan.Uber did not respond on Saturday to a request to comment about the Khosrowshahi plan. But the company said earlier in a statement that Kalanick’s appointments were a “complete surprise” to Uber and its board. “That is precisely why we are working to put in place world-class governance to ensure that we are building a company every employee and shareholder can be proud of,” the statement said.Yucaipa Companies managing partner Ron Burkle, an investor who has supported Kalanick, praised Burns and Thain as “smart, high-quality people.”Division among Uber investors exploded in public in August, when Benchmark Capital filed a lawsuit to force Kalanick off the board and rescind his ability to fill two other seats on the panel, accusing him of concealing a range of misdeeds. Yucaipa and other Uber investors defended Kalanick and asked Benchmark to divest its own shares and step down from the board.A Delaware judge later that month stayed the Benchmark lawsuit and sent it to arbitration, pushing the dispute out of public view and delivering Kalanick a victory.Kalanick’s action on Friday could be subject to a new legal challenge. Benchmark or other Uber investors could attempt to block the appointments by asking the Delaware judge to issue a so-called “status-quo order.” The judge last month did not grant such a request.Kalanick’s lawyer at the time told the court that Kalanick had not rushed to fill the seats. The New York Times also quoted Kalanick’s lawyer as telling the court Kalanick had the power to fill the seats under the pre-arbitration “status quo.”"

537,"DUBAI: Hard hit by a drop in oil income, energy-rich Gulf states will next year introduce value-added tax to a region long known for being tax-free.Some have hailed introducing VAT as the start of ""exciting, dramatic"" change in the region, but the measure is also expected to push prices up for all residents including citizens and low-income workers.On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates doubles the price of tobacco and increases soft drink prices by 50 percent, ahead of the more general VAT on goods and services from January 1.The UAE is one of the six Gulf Cooperation Council states to have agreed to introduce VAT at five percent next year as they seek to revitalise their economies.The UAE and Saudi Arabia have said they will implement VAT from January 1, 2018, while the other GCC states of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar are expected to follow suit during the year.Economies in the Gulf -- home to the world´s biggest exporters of oil and liquefied natural gas -- took a major hit after a global supply glut triggered a drop in prices in 2014.Their balance sheets have remained in the red despite government austerity measures recommended by the International Monetary Fund, including freezing wages, benefits and state-funded projects, cutting subsidies and raising power and fuel prices.Governments across the region have also drawn hundreds of billions of dollars from their massive sovereign wealth resources in an attempt to curb the deficit.The six states are now taking austerity measures a step further with the plan to introduce VAT, ending their decades-old reputation for being tax havens.Accounting and consultancy firm Deloitte has said the progressive implementation of VAT from next year ""marks the start of some of the most exciting, dramatic and far-reaching socio-economic changes in the region since the discovery of oil"" more than half a century ago.But the move is expected to increase prices across the board including for nationals, who make up roughly half of the GCC´s overall population of 50 million.Gulf nationals have for decades benefited from a generous cradle-to-grave welfare system, and have largely been spared by austerity measures so far.VAT, a consumption tax imposed on goods and services, is generally paid by individual consumers to businesses, which then transfer the funds to tax authorities.""Citizens won´t be happy about the price hikes from the VAT. I don´t think it will be acceptable as it will affect people´s budgets,"" said Khaled Mohammed, a Saudi working in Dubai´s property sector.The IMF has insisted the introduction of VAT will not drive away millions of expatriates until now lured by a tax-free environment.But the future looks daunting for the region´s tens of thousands of low-income workers.""It´s going to be tough for all those who draw small salaries,"" said Rezwan Sheikh, an Indian restaurant worker in Dubai.""We´re already struggling with finances. How much are we going to save after the VAT?"" asked Sheikh, who sends most of his salary home to his parents and pregnant wife.Saudi Arabia and the UAE alone make up 75 percent of the GCC´s $1.4-trillion economy and are home to 80 percent of the Gulf population, citizens and expatriates.Under the agreement between GCC states, some goods and services will be exempt from the tax.Bryan Plamondon of the US-based IHS Markit Economics says food, education, and healthcare, as well as renewable energy, water, transportation, and technology, are likely to receive preferential treatment.He estimates that VAT will raise between $7 billion (5.95 billion euros) and $21 billion (17.77 billion euros) annually -- or between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent of GDP.The IMF has said the returns could reach around two percent of GDP.But inflation rates will also increase.Faisal Durrani, who heads research at Cluttons Dubai, expects inflation to double to four percent in the UAE next year.Capital Economics has projected Saudi inflation could reach 4.5 percent, a stark shift from the current 0.4 percent deflation.Finally, says leading Kuwaiti economist Jassem al-Saadun, governments will need more than numbers to ensure a successful introduction of VAT.""People must be convinced that there is social justice, that raised funds will be used for development projects and that corruption is checked,"" the head of Al-Shall Consulting told AFP."

The bill will now be taken up by the Lower House of Parliament, where the PML-N holds a majority, on Monday.  Nawaz, who with his family members is facing several cases of corruption in an accountability court, is set to be indicted in tomorrow's hearing. Moreover, as of now, there is no official indication that Nawaz's daughter Maryam, sons Hussain and Hasan, and son-in-law MNA Capt (retd) Safdar — all accused in various cases — will appear in court despite orders.At the last hearing on October 2, Accountability Court-I Judge Mohammad Bashir ordered to indict Nawaz and issued bailable arrest warrants for his absent family members as they failed to appear in court despite two summons.Former premier appeared before accountability court today; to be indicted on October 2Nawaz and his family members had been summoned to the court with regards to three corruption references filed against them by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Nawaz's counsel, Khawaja Harris, pleaded the court to exempt his client from personal appearance. However, the judge observed that the matter would be deliberated upon once Nawaz has been indicted.Following his appearance, Nawaz held a press conference at Punjab House — his usual residence in Islamabad since his disqualification by the Supreme Court on July 28 — where he said he was not the one to flee judicial proceedings. He once again questioned the grounds for his disqualification as well as the way the corruption cases against him are proceeding.  The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has filed three references against Nawaz and his family, pertaining to which an accountability court summoned them on September 19 for the first time.However, the Sharifs failed to appear before the court as they were all in London. The court then set September 26 as the next date of hearing, issuing another summons for the Sharif family. At that hearing, only Nawaz appeared in court. Around 1,500 security personnel were deployed to secure the route from Punjab House to Sector G-11, where the court is located, as well as the courts complexNAB, in total, has filed three references against the Sharif family and one against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in the accountability court in light of the Supreme Court's orders in the Panama Papers verdict.The bureau was given six weeks, from the date of the apex court's order, to file the reference in an accountability court while the accountability court was granted six months to wrap up the proceedings.The references against the Sharif family pertain to the Al Azizia Steel Mills, their London properties and over dozen offshore companies.NAB's Rawalpindi branch prepared references regarding the Azizia Steel Mills and the nearly dozen companies owned by the Sharif family.The bureau's Lahore branch prepared a reference on the Sharif family's Avenfield apartments in London and another against Dar for owning assets beyond his known sources of income.If convicted, the accused can face up to 14 years imprisonment and lifelong disqualification from holding public office including the freezing of bank accounts and assets. "
540,"BARCELONA: Spanish national police moved to shut down a banned independence referendum in Catalonia on Sunday, confronting crowds of angry voters at some polling stations in a showdown that has raised fears of unrest across the wealthy northeastern region.Police with riot shields jostled with hundreds of voters outside one station at a school in Barcelona, the Catalan capital, as the crowd chanted “we are people of peace!”. Armoured vans and an ambulance were parked nearby.The referendum, declared illegal by Spain’s central government, has thrown the country into its worst constitutional crisis in decades and raised fears of street violence as a test of will between Madrid and Barcelona plays out.The Catalan government had scheduled voting to open at 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) at around 2,300 designated stations, but Madrid said on Saturday it had shut more than half of them.Voting started at some sites in the region on Sunday after people had occupied them with the aim of preventing police from locking them down. Organisers smuggled in ballot boxes before dawn and urged voters to use passive resistance against police.Catalan leaders vowed to press ahead with the vote despite Spanish attempts to thwart preparations, including the seizure of ballot papers and boxes, and it said it would give an estimate of the early turn-out later in the morning.The Catalan government said voters could print out ballot papers at home and lodge them at any polling station not closed down by police.“I have got up early because my country needs me,” said Eulalia Espinal, a 65-year-old pensioner who started queuing with around 100 others outside one polling station, a Barcelona school, in rain at about 5 a.m. (0300 GMT).“We don’t know what’s going to happen but we have to be here,” she said.Organisers had asked voters to turn out before dawn, hoping for large crowds to be the world’s first image of voting day.“This is a great opportunity. I’ve waited 80 years for this,” said 92-year-old Ramon Jordana, a former taxi driver waiting to vote in Sant Pere de Torello, a town in the foothills of the Pyrenees and a pro-independence bastion.He had wrapped his wrists in Catalan flags, among 100-150 people who gathered at a local school that had been listed as a polling station, ready to block any police from entering. A tractor also stood guard, though no police had yet arrived.Leading up to the referendum, Spanish police arrested Catalan officials, seized campaigning leaflets and occupied the Catalan government’s communications hub.But Catalan leaders urged voters to turn out in a peaceful expression of democracy. Families have occupied scores of schools earmarked as voting centres, sleeping overnight in an attempt to prevent police from sealing them off.If some voting goes ahead, a “yes” result is likely, given that many unionists are not expected to turn out.“If I can’t vote, I want to turn out in the streets and say sincerely that we want to vote,” said independence supporter Jose Miro, a 60-year-old schools inspector.Only the Catalan police, or Mossos d‘Esquadra, had so far been monitoring polling stations. They are held in affection by Catalans, especially after they hunted down Islamists accused of staging deadly attacks in the region in August.Pro-independence Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont originally said that if the “yes” vote won, the Catalan government would declare independence within 48 hours, but regional leaders have since acknowledged Madrid’s crackdown has undermined the vote.Markets have reacted cautiously but calmly to the situation so far, though credit rating agency S&P said on Friday that protracted tensions in Catalonia could hurt Spain’s economic outlook. The region accounts for about a fifth of the economy.The ballot will have no legal status as it has been blocked by Spain’s Constitutional Court, and Madrid has the ultimate power under its 1978 charter to suspend the regional government’s authority to rule if it declares independence.The Madrid government, which has sent thousands of police to Catalonia to enforce a court ban on the vote, believes it has done enough to prevent any meaningful referendum taking place.A minority of around 40 percent of Catalans support independence, polls show, although a majority want to hold a referendum on the issue. The region of 7.5 million people has an economy larger than that of Portugal."
541,"LOS ANGELES: Was Harrison Ford’s Officer Rick Deckard a human or a Replicant robot in 1982’s “Blade Runner”?That is the question that fans of Ridley Scott’s sci-fi thriller have been pondering for 35 years and now in a long-awaited sequel, that question is explored further.Out in theaters Oct. 6, “Blade Runner 2049” takes place 30 years after the original film, when human-like robots called Replicants were hunted by police officers called ‘blade runners’ in a dystopian Los Angeles.In the new film from Time Warner Inc’s Warner Bros, LAPD Officer K (Ryan Gosling) hunts illegal Replicants hiding on a decaying Earth and he stumbles across something that can disrupt the current strained co-existence between humans and Replicants. He is tasked with finding Deckard (Ford) for answers.“It’s an existential story,” director Denis Villeneuve told Reuters.“It says a lot about reality. It says a lot about our relationship with broken dreams. It says things about as human beings we are programmed by our genetic background and our education, and that we are like trapped by that background and it’s very difficult for us to get free out of it,” he added.Before journalists including Reuters saw “Blade Runner 2049” at advance press screenings, they were read a note from Villeneuve urging not give away any key plot points.What is known is that an older, rugged Ford reprises his role as Officer Deckard. The veteran actor called the film an “experiential opportunity” for audiences to engage in the philosophical rhetoric.“There’s a wonderful emotional context in the film, which is one of the things I most admire about it,” Ford said. “So much of what I had an ambition for seems to have been achieved.”Scott’s “Blade Runner” envisioned Los Angeles in 2019 as a sprawling urban metropolis infused with Eastern and Western cultures. In “Blade Runner 2049,” Los Angeles has sprawled across much of California, and is built on top of Scott’s world, the gritty city a melting pot of English, Japanese and Russian influences.Villeneuve said he made “Blade Runner 2049” as a standalone movie but given the new film’s higher stakes and bigger scope, a continuing franchise is not out of the question.“The idea was to make a movie inspired by the universe of ‘Blade Runner’ with a very specific story and yes, I‘m positive that if (it) ever is welcomed, Ridley will come up with another idea,” the director said."

We approved the request for family reunification,"" he told TV2.Israel jailed Vanunu in 1986 for disclosing the inner workings of its Dimona nuclear plant to Britain´s Sunday Times newspaper.He spent more than 10 years of his sentence in solitary confinement.Upon his release in 2004, Vanunu was slapped with a series of restraining orders, forbidding him from travel, contact with foreigners or speaking to the media.He has twice been jailed for breaking those orders.The couple´s Norwegian lawyer, Arild Humlen, said the immigration agency´s decision had increased the likelihood of Vanunu leaving Israel to settle in Norway.""I hope it will resolve a blocked situation and that Israel will seize this opportunity,"" he told TV2.Vanunu converted from Judaism to Christianity shortly before being snatched by Mossad agents in Rome in 1986 and smuggled to Israel.On Sunday, a spokesman for Israel´s foreign ministry could not say if Vanunu had made a new request to travel to Norway.But he said restrictions on the whistleblower´s freedom of movement were ""due to the danger that he posed"" to the Jewish state.In a statement, the foreign ministry said: ""Israel will continue to review updates of the situation in order to determine appropriate restrictions in accordance with security dangers posed by Vanunu.""Israel is the Middle East´s sole if undeclared nuclear power, refusing to confirm or deny that it has such weapons.Israel has refused to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or to allow international surveillance of its Dimona plant in the Negev desert in southern Israel."

The current outbreak was unusual as it had affected large urban areas, increasing the risk of transmission, the WHO warned.The outbreak is a mix of bubonic plague, which spreads by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague spread person-to-person.The highly infectious disease killed millions of people across the world in the past before being largely wiped out.""WHO is concerned that plague could spread further because it is already present in several cities and this is the start of the epidemic season,"" Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, said in a statement Sunday. “Our teams are on the ground in Madagascar providing technical guidance.”The first death this year occurred on August 28 when a passenger died in a public taxi en route to a town on the east coast. Two others who came into contact with the passenger also died.Officials are trying to identify people who came into contact with a basketball coach from the Seychelles who died of plague in Antananarivo on Wednesday while visiting the island for a sports event.Plague can be cured with antibiotics but can be fatal within 24 hours if it affects the lungs.On Saturday, the health ministry said the death toll had risen to 24 from 19 on Thursday, with more than 100 infected.The recurrent outbreaks in Madagascar have been attributed to poor hygiene and insufficient health care.The government said one girl among the dead had apparently been involved in a ceremony retrieving the bodies of deceased family members, rewrapping their remains and dancing with the corpses.WHO has released $300,000 in emergency funds, as well as extra supplies of antibiotics and protective equipment.It appealed for $1.5 million to fund the emergency response. "

Organisers smuggled in ballot boxes before dawn and urged voters to use passive resistance against police.Catalan leaders vowed to press ahead with the vote despite Spanish attempts to thwart preparations, including the seizure of ballot papers and boxes, and it said it would give an estimate of the early turn-out later in the morning.The Catalan government said voters could print out ballot papers at home and lodge them at any polling station not closed down by police.“I have got up early because my country needs me,” said Eulalia Espinal, a 65-year-old pensioner who started queuing with around 100 others outside one polling station, a Barcelona school, in rain at about 5am (0300 GMT).“We don’t know what’s going to happen but we have to be here,” she said.Organisers had asked voters to turn out before dawn, hoping for large crowds to be the world’s first image of voting day.“This is a great opportunity. I’ve waited 80 years for this,” said 92-year-old Ramon Jordana, a former taxi driver waiting to vote in Sant Pere de Torello, a town in the foothills of the Pyrenees and a pro-independence bastion.He had wrapped his wrists in Catalan flags, among 100-150 people who gathered at a local school that had been listed as a polling station, ready to block any police from entering. A tractor also stood guard, though no police had yet arrived.Leading up to the referendum, Spanish police arrested Catalan officials, seized campaigning leaflets and occupied the Catalan government’s communications hub.But Catalan leaders urged voters to turn out in a peaceful expression of democracy. Families have occupied scores of schools earmarked as voting centres, sleeping overnight in an attempt to prevent police from sealing them off.If some voting goes ahead, a “yes” result is likely, given that many unionists are not expected to turn out.“If I can’t vote, I want to turn out in the streets and say sincerely that we want to vote,” said independence supporter Jose Miro, a 60-year-old schools inspector.The pro-independence Catalan leader originally said that if the “yes” vote won, the Catalan government would declare independence within 48 hours, but regional leaders have since acknowledged Madrid’s crackdown has undermined the vote.Markets have reacted cautiously but calmly to the situation so far, though credit rating agency S&P said on Friday that protracted tensions in Catalonia could hurt Spain’s economic outlook. The region accounts for about a fifth of the economy.The ballot will have no legal status as it has been blocked by Spain’s Constitutional Court, and Madrid has the ultimate power under its 1978 charter to suspend the regional government’s authority to rule if it declares independence.The Madrid government, which has sent thousands of police to Catalonia to enforce a court ban on the vote, believes it has done enough to prevent any meaningful referendum taking place.A minority of around 40 percent of Catalans support independence, polls show, although a majority want to hold a referendum on the issue. The region of 7.5 million people has an economy larger than that of Portugal."
557,"ABU DHABI: Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah grabbed the key wicket of Dinesh Chandimal to leave Sri Lanka fighting to avoid defeat after the fourth day of the first Test in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.The prolific wicket-taker took 2-25 as Sri Lanka struggled to 69-4, needing a rearguard action to save the Test.Pakistan will be expecting to push for victory in the opening match of a two-Test series on the fifth and final day.It was tough to negotiate spin on a fourth-day Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch, but despite a 32nd Test five-wicket haul for veteran Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath, Pakistan posted 422 to take a slender three-run lead.Sri Lanka had made 419 in their first innings.At the close, Kusal Mendis was batting on 16, with nightwatchman Suranga Lakmal on two, after a day of fluctuating fortunes.Herath´s 5-93 in 40 overs were well foiled by a brilliant 76 by Test debutant Haris Sohail, as initially, it looked as though Sri Lanka would take a first-innings lead.Pakistan then hit back in the second innings through Shah, who first had opener Dimuth Karunaratne caught for 10 and then dismissed first-innings centurion Chandimal, caught at slip, for seven.Sohail followed his responsible knock by claiming Kaushal Silva´s wicket, whom he trapped leg before for 25, while part-timer Asad Shafiq had Lahiru Thirimanne for seven.The 28-year-old Sohail´s impressive Test bow has come despite a career-threatening knee injury which required surgery in 2015.""The last two years were tough for me as there was a lot of talk on my injury,"" he said.""But thankfully I am here and played a responsible knock. I was under pressure because we needed to take the lead, so I had to play a responsible knock which I did.""Earlier in the day, Pakistan too were struggling at 316-6 and were in danger of conceding a healthy lead with Herath using all his experience and guile.The 39-year-old left-arm spinner, who now has 394 wickets in 84 Tests, gave his team the much-needed wicket of a resolute Azhar Ali, luring him into an uppish drive which was brilliantly caught at short mid-wicket by a diving Mendis.Azhar´s defiant knock of 85 lasted more than five hours and included four boundaries, but with his dismissal, Pakistan´s hopes of building a lead looked slim.But Sohail had other ideas as he added an invaluable 50 for the ninth wicket with tail-ender Hasan Ali to lift Pakistan from 340-8.Sohail hit seven fours and two sixes before holing out to paceman Nuwan Pradeep, who finished with 2-77.Hasan´s whirlwind 25-ball 29 featured three sixes and two fours.The second and final Test — a day-night affair — will be played in Dubai from October 6."

562,"KUALA LUMPUR: Two women accused of assassinating the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un with a banned nerve agent pleaded not guilty at the start of a high-profile murder trial in a Malaysian court on Monday.Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese, are charged with killing Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a chemical poison banned by the United Nations, at Kuala Lumpur’s international airport on Feb. 13.Police have also named four North Koreans as suspects in the case and an Interpol red notice, an international alert just short of an arrest warrant, has been issued for the North Koreans, who remain at large.Prosecutors said the four North Koreans helped the accused women carry out several practice runs in Kuala Lumpur shopping malls.“The prank practice carried out by the first and second accused with the supervision of the four who are still at large was preparation to see through their common intention to kill the victim,” the prosecution said in its charge sheet.Defense lawyers demanded that the prosecution immediately name the four other suspects, who have also been charged, so they could prepare their case.“The charge must be clear,” said Siti Aisyah’s lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng.Judge Azmi Ariffin dismissed their request.Both women wore bullet-proof vests as they were led into the court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital. They face the death penalty if convicted.The two women nodded their heads when the charges were read out to them by two interpreters in the Shah Alam court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital. The interpreters said both women pleaded not guilty.The prosecution said their actions showed “intent to kill the victim” by smearing his face and eyes with VX nerve agent, which a post-mortem confirmed had killed Kim.The women told their lawyers they did not know they were participating in a deadly attack and believed they were carrying out a prank for a reality TV show.The two women sat quietly during the opening day of the trial. Siti was dressed in a black floral suit, while Huong wore a white long-sleeved t-shirt and jeans. The courtroom was packed with embassy officials and media.Juliana Idris, who works at the airport, told the court a man later identified as Kim Jong Nam approached her and asked her to take him to a police station. Kim later went to the airport clinic but died there within 20 minutes.She said the man, who spoke English, told her he had been “attacked by a woman from behind ... another one closed his eyes”.“His hands were shaking a bit, I don’t know why,” she said.Police Lance Corporal Mohd Zulkarnain Sanudin, who was on duty at the Kuala Lumpur International airport on the day of the killing, said Idris had brought Kim Jong Nam to him.He said Kim told him a substance had been wiped on his face. Kim’s eyes were red and he could see some liquid on his face, Zulkarnain said.He also said the he had wrongly recorded Kim Jong Nam’s nationality as South Korean.“The police report I made showed the nationality as South Korean, while on the passport, it was written DPR Korea, whereby I did not know what DPR meant. I was only sure that Korea was South Korea,” he told the court.DPRK is the acronym for North Korea’s official name, the Democratic Republic of North Korea."

570,"DHAKA: Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to set up a “working group” to plan the repatriation of more than half a million Rohingya Muslim refugees who have fled to Bangladesh to escape an army crackdown, the Bangladeshi foreign minister said.The United Nations has called the exodus of 507,000 Rohingya since late August the world’s fastest-developing refugee emergency and says Buddhist-majority Myanmar is engaging in ethnic cleansing against its Rohingya Muslim minority.Myanmar denies that. It says its forces are battling Rohingya “terrorists” who triggered the latest wave of violence with coordinated attacks on the security forces on August 25.Myanmar says more than 500 people have been killed since, most of them insurgents, whom it has accused of attacking civilians and setting most of the fires that have reduced to ashes more than half of more than 400 Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine State.Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali said he and Myanmar official Kyaw Tint Swe had agreed in their talks to set up the working group to draw up plans for repatriation.“We are looking forward to a peaceful solution to the crisis,” Ali told reporters.Kyaw Tint Swe did not speak to the media and government spokesmen in Myanmar were not immediately available for comment.Waves of Rohingya have taken refuge in Bangladesh over the years complaining of persecution, in particular in the late 1970s, the early 1990s and in October last year, following smaller insurgent attacks on the security forces.The neighbours have agreed on repatriation plans before, but the fundamental problem - the status of Rohingya in Myanmar - remains unsettled.The Rohingya are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots in Myanmar that go back centuries, with communities marginalised and subjected to bouts of communal violence over the years.Problems of statelessness had to be tackled, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a meeting in Geneva. “Nowhere is the link between statelessness and displacement more evident than with the Rohingya community,” he said.The crisis over the treatment of the Rohingya is the biggest problem Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has had to face since forming a government last year after winning a landmark 2015 election.The Nobel peace laureate, in an address to the nation last month, said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process under a 1993 agreement with Bangladesh and “refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem”.But many refugees are gloomy about the prospects of going back, fearing they will not be able to furnish the documents they anticipate Myanmar will demand to prove they have a right to return.Myanmar has refused to grant access to a UN fact-finding mission but Suu Kyi last year appointed a team led by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan to draw up recommendations on solving problems in Rakhine.The commission presented its recommendations on Auguat 24, a day before the insurgent attacks, among them a review of a law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless.The panel also recommended that the government punish rights violations, ensure the right to freedom of movement and invest in infrastructure to lift the state out of poverty.Suu Kyi, in her address to the nation last month, said she was committed to the recommendations.There were already about 300,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the latest exodus.In Myanmar, the government took diplomats to Rakhine to let them see the situation.“Maungdaw feels like a ghost town,” Swiss ambassador Paul Seger said on Twitter, as he arrived in a main town in the north of Rakhine.Myanmar has blocked most aid workers and the media from the area, despite calls from Western countries for access to deal with what aid groups fear is an unfolding humanitarian crisis.The diplomats were also due to be taken to the Rohingya village of Ah Nauk Pyin, which Reuters reported last month was cut off and threatened by hostile Rakhine Buddhist neighbours. An itinerary of the trip referred to the report.Suu Kyi has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out strongly enough on behalf of the long-persecuted minority and of defending the army action.She has no power over security policy under a military-drafted constitution and the public in Myanmar, where Buddhist nationalism has surged over recent years, is generally hostile toward the Rohingya.The United States, in its strongest criticism of Myanmar over the crisis, called last week on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar’s military. But it stopped short of threatening to reimpose sanctions.A small protest against Western pressure and foreign media coverage was held in Myanmar’s biggest city of Yangon.A message on one banner accused the United States, Britain and others of nurturing Islamic domination in Asia “for their vested interest to beat China and India”."

""This is not a big issue but this is an issue which affects ordinary people,"" he remarked, adding government is focusing on just creating difficulties for the normal people.The petrol prices are $44 per barrel. Even after adding some taxes it should be no more than Rs66. However, the government is charging 31 percent sales tax. “Is it really necessary to charge 31 per cent tax? If you reduce the GST then the prices won't increase,” he added.“In all developing nations, governments introduce taxes on yearly basis. However, we get new taxes every month,” he claimed. “Budget should be presented four times in the NA,” he said, adding that last time budget was presented such a situation was created that opposition had no other option than to protest it.“We have always given importance to this parliament. All problems can be solved in the parliament,” he added.  In August, following Nawaz Sharif's disqualification by the Supreme Court, the ECP had informed the PML-N that according to the Political Parties Order 2002, a disqualified MNA cannot hold any position in the party.Amendment suggested by Aitzaz Ahsan was rejected by a margin of one voteLast week, the PML-N managed to amend the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017 in the opposition-controlled Senate in favour of Nawaz's bid to become the party president. The bill will now be tabled in the Lower House of Parliament, where the PML-N holds a majority, on Monday.According to the bill, every citizen will have the right to be a part of a political party, except those in government service, and will also have the right to form a party. It enables the ECP to scrutinise election expenses within 90 days, failing which election expenses submitted by a political party would be deemed to be correct.The bill states that any parliamentarian could only be disqualified for a period of five years and that ECP will be an independent and autonomous body, which will formulate its own law, and party funding details will be available online.The PML-N can be barred from partaking in any electoral activity if it fails to appoint a party chief within the designated timeIt also restricts the caretaker government from making any policy decisions.During a meeting of Central Working Committee at the Punjab House, the party members endorsed a resolution forwarded by Climate Change Minister Senator Mushahidullah Khan.The party leaders expressed confidence and reaffirmed their trust on the party leader. They also paid tribute to the former prime minister for his services during his tenure.Meanwhile, the PML-N has also summoned a meeting of its general council Tuesday to appoint Nawaz as the party's president after his removal from office.Former senator and the party's chief election commissioner, Chaudhry Jafar Iqbal, will apprise the members of schedule for the election of party president.It is quite unlikely for any other PML-N member to file his nomination for post.*An earlier version of the story said that the bill was titled Electoral Reforms Bill 2017. The error is regretted. "
572,"LAS VEGAS: At least 50 people were killed and more than 400 injured when a gunman opened fire at a country music festival in Las Vegas Strip on Sunday, raining down bullets from the 32nd floor of a hotel for several minutes before he was shot dead by police.The death toll, which police emphasized was preliminary, would make the attack the deadliest mass shooting in US history, eclipsing last year’s massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub.Some 22,000 people were in the crowd when the man opened fire, sending panicked people fleeing the scene, in some cases trampling one another, as law enforcement officers scrambled to locate and kill the gunman. Shocked concert goers, some with blood on their clothes, wandered the streets after the attack.At least 406 people were taken to area hospitals with injuries, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said.Police identified the gunman as area resident Stephen Paddock, 64, and said they had no information yet about his motive.He was not believed to be connected to any militant group, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters.“We have no idea what his belief system was,” Lombardo said. “We’ve located numerous firearms within the room that he occupied.”Authorities had earlier regarded Paddock’s roommate, Marilou Danley, as a person of interest, but later on Monday said they no longer regarded her as related to the case, CNN and Fox News reported, citing police sources.Police had located two cars that belonged to the suspect.The dead included one off-duty police officer, while at least one other officer was critically injured, Lombardo said. Police warned the death toll may rise.Video taken of the attack showed panicked crowds fleeing as sustained rapid gunfire ripped through the area.“It sounded like fireworks. People were just dropping to the ground. It just kept going on,” said Steve Smith, a 45-year-old visitor from Phoenix, Arizona, who had flown in for the concert. He said the gunfire went on for an extended period of time.“Probably 100 shots at a time. It would sound like it was reloading and then it would go again,” Smith said. “People were shot and trying to get out. A lot of people were shot.”Las Vegas’s casinos, nightclubs and shopping draw some 3.5 million visitors from around the world each year and the area was packed with visitors when the shooting broke out shortly after 10 p.m. local time (0400 GMT).Mike McGarry, a 53-year-old financial adviser from Philadelphia, was at the concert when he heard hundreds of shots ring out.“It was crazy - I laid on top of the kids. They’re 20. I‘m 53. I lived a good life,” McGarry said. The back of his shirt bore footmarks, after people ran over him in the panicked crowd.The shooting broke out on the final night of the three-day Route 91 Harvest festival, a sold-out event attended by thousands and featuring top acts such as Eric Church, Sam Hunt and Jason Aldean.“Tonight has been beyond horrific,” Aldean said in a statement on Instagram. “It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.”The suspected shooter’s brother, Eric Paddock, said the family was stunned by the news.“We have no idea. We’re horrified. We’re bewildered and our condolences go out to the victims,” Eric Paddock said in a brief telephone interview, his voice trembling. “We have no idea in the world.”US President Donald Trump offered his condolences to the victims via a post on Twitter early Monday.“My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!” Trump said.The rampage was reminiscent of a mass shooting at a Paris rock concert in November 2015 that killed 89 people, part of a wave of coordinated attacks by Islamist militants that left 130 dead.The concert venue was in an outdoor area known as Las Vegas Village, across the Strip from the Mandalay Bay and the Luxor hotels.“Our thoughts & prayers are with the victims of last night’s tragic events,” the Mandalay Bay said on Twitter.Shares of US casino operators fell in premarket trading on Wall Street, with MGM Resorts International, which owns the Mandalay Bay, down 5 per cent. Melco Resorts & Entertainment Ltd, Wynn Resorts Ltd and Las Vegas Sands Corp each fell 1 to 2pc."
573,"ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif is set to leave for United States this week, where he is expected to meet US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to resume bilateral talks and work out ways to dispel tensions that cropped up after US President Donald Trump's August 21 speech.In the first high-profile meeting between US and Pakistan since Trump’s speech, US Vice President Mike Pence had recently met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and suggested sending a US delegation to Islamabad for talks aimed at removing tensions.While accepting the proposal, Pakistan had asked for a high-level meeting in Washington to defuse the tensions. In response, Washington had reportedly invited Asif for a meeting with Secretary Tillerson on October 4.Pakistan needs to continue its war against terrorism, says foreign ministerAsif is also addressing a gathering at the US Institute of Peace (USIP) in Washington on US-Pakistan relations on October 5, the institute confirmed, pointing out that Trump’s speech had not only “unsettled US-Pakistan relations” but also had “serious implications for US interests in Afghanistan, nuclear non-proliferation, and stability in the region”.Trump, in his speech announcing the revised US approach to Afghan war, had accused Pakistan of providing ""safe haven"" to militants, angering the ruling party and the opposition alike. "
574,"ABU DHABI: The Pakistani batting line-up crumbled in the face of Sri Lanka bowling, losing the first Test on Monday despite a five-wicket haul by Yasir Shah giving Sarfraz XI an easy 136-run target.Things did not go Pakistan's way as a seemingly achievable target soon loomed large, with Sami Aslam (2), Azhar Ali (0), Shan Masood (7), Babar Azam (3) and Asad Shafiq (20) being quickly sent back to the pavilion early in the innings.Even skipper Sarfraz Ahmed could manage only 19 runs with the bat.The real blow came when Haris Sohail was dismissed for 34 in the 38th over, caught LBW by Perera.Sohail had provided a much-needed anchor, taking Pakistan to 98, but wickets fell in quick succession after that.The entire team was dismissed before the Sri Lanka bowlers could begin the 48th over.This is the first time in 20 years that Pakistan has been unable to chase a score under 150 runs. In October 1997, Pakistan were bowled out for 92, chasing a target of 146 against South Africa at Faisalabad.HMRKB Herath picked up a match-winning 6 wickets haul for 43 runs, while Perera picked up 3 for 46.In the first innings, Herath got winning figures of 5-93 in 40 overs, taking him to an overall 11-wicket haul in the match.Earlier in the opening session today, pacer Mohammad Abbas bagged two wickets to take Pakistan close to a comfortable target. Abbas dismissed Mendis and Lakmal within the opening hour of the morning session, getting the former trapped LBW for 18 and the latter caught in the deep for 13.Shah starred with figures of 51-5. On Sunday, he grabbed the key wicket of Dinesh Chandimal.It was tough to negotiate spin on a fourth-day Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch, but despite a 32nd Test five-wicket haul for veteran Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath, Pakistan posted 422 to take a slender three-run lead.Sri Lanka had made 419 in their first innings.Herath's 5-93 in 40 overs were well foiled by a brilliant 76 by Test debutant Haris Sohail, as initially, it looked as though Sri Lanka would take a first-innings lead.Pakistan then hit back in the second innings through Shah, who first had opener Dimuth Karunaratne caught for 10 and then dismissed first-innings centurion Chandimal, caught at slip, for seven.Sohail followed his responsible knock by claiming Kaushal Silva's wicket, whom he trapped leg before for 25, while part-timer Asad Shafiq had Lahiru Thirimanne for seven."
575,"KARACHI: Federal Investigative Agency on Monday registered a case against Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder on charges of money laundering, sources informed Geo News.The case has been filed at the department's state bank circle by former MQM member Sarfraz Merchant. He alleged that the party leaders used to send money to founder MQM from bank accounts of Khildmat-e-Khalq Foundation (KKF) through Hawala channel.Sources have informed that along with violation of bank laws, anti-terrorism charges have been included in the case against MQM-L leader.Meanwhile, Scotland Yard confirmed that an ‘International Letter of Request’ has been sent by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to the Pakistani authorities, seeking help in its investigations in relation to at least two speeches made by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s founder.A spokesman for Scotland Yard said that a letter under “Mutual Legal Assistance” has been sent to Pakistan’s “competent authorities” in relation to two speeches made by the MQM leader on March 11, 2015 and Aug 22, 2016.Scotland Yard has made it clear that the MQM leader is under investigation but currently there are no charges against him.The Scotland Yard confirmed that Pakistani authorities lodged a complaint with the Met Police in the form of a FIR “requesting that consideration be given to MQM founder being investigated because of comments he made during interview”.The letter further says that on August 22, 2016, MQM founder addressed a crowd at the Karachi Press Club by telephone or similar means, following which there was violence. “Towards the end of the speech, he seemed to be encouraging the audience to go and attack local media stations, the Sindh Police and the Sindh government offices and Secretariat”. According to the CPS, the protesters attacked a local news channel and “as a result of the violence, one person was killed and several others were injured.”The request letter requests Pakistan to hand over a large amount of evidence in various forms so that it could assess if this material could be used for prosecution and to bring charges against the London-based leader. This includes copies of investigation files on speeches; Sindh Police file; the Sindh Counter-terror police investigation file, the FIA file; the Sindh Rangers file; details of any suspects in relation to the incident on March 11, 2015, and August 22, 2016; witness statements; audio and visual messages and recordings; statements from any pathologists regarding to Waqas Shah’s death; and any other information that could be helpful.The document goes on to explain to Pakistan that it needs all the evidence to ensure that proper investigation could be done in Britain but it warns that there should be no altering or tampering with any of the original documents and no new paper or evidence should be created and all the computers and equipment used originally for the recording of evidence should be preserved."
576,"OTTAWA: Jagmeet Singh was named leader of Canada's New Democratic Party (NDP) on Sunday, the country's third biggest political force after Justin Trudeau's Liberals and the Conservatives.Singh, 38, won almost 54 percent of votes in the first round of voting against three other candidates. He will replace charismatic Thomas Mulcair as the leader of the party.""Canadians must stand united to champion the politics of courage over the politics of fear, the politics of love to fight the growing politics of division,"" Singh said, speaking after the results were announced.The speech was particularly poignant in the aftermath of a suspected terrorist attack in Edmonton early Sunday, which saw a man stab a police officer and deliberately ram pedestrians during a high-speed chase in a rented truck.Criminal lawyer Singh – born into a Punjabi Indian family in Scarborough, Ontario – often wears a brightly colored turban and usually wears a Kirpan, a sword or knife carried by Sikh men which is banned in certain places in Canada.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau congratulated Singh on his election.""I look forward to speaking soon and working together for Canadians,"" he wrote on Twitter.Singh is a member of the Ontario provincial member parliament, not of the federal parliament in Ottawa – meaning he cannot press Trudeau during the daily question period.He hinted during his campaign he would not immediately seek a seat, which would require the resignation of an elected official to give him a place in a constituency where he could easily win.Mulcair, who became NDP leader in 2012, was forced out in April 2016 when 52 per cent of delegates at the party's convention voted in favor of choosing a new leader, following defeat in the 2015 election."

578,"MANCHESTER: Gibraltar is very concerned by violence in Catalonia after Spanish riot police burst into polling stations and seized ballot papers to prevent a banned referendum on a split from Spain, the chief minister of “the Rock” said.Police hit people with batons, fired rubber bullets into crowds, and forcibly removed would-be voters from polling stations in actions that were condemned internationally but were described by the government as “proportionate”.The referendum — declared illegal by Spain’s central government — has thrown the country into its worst constitutional crisis in decades and deepened a centuries-old rift between Madrid and Barcelona.Catalan officials said over 460 people had been injured in the police crackdown and the Spanish Interior Ministry said 12 police had been hurt.“I am very concerned to see violence in the streets of our neighbouring nation,” Chief Minister Fabian Picardo told Reuters in an interview at the Conservative Party conference in the northern English city of Manchester.Gibraltar — a tiny British enclave on Spain’s southern tip — is dubbed “the Rock” because of its famous cliff-faced mountain.Spain claims sovereignty over the territory it ceded to Britain in 1713.Spain’s Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis last month said Gibraltar was an anachronistic colony that had no place in the modern world.“The claim by Spain to the land that I call my home is anachronistic and remnant of a bygone era,” Picardo said. “But anyone who visits Gibraltar realizes it is far from anachronistic — it is modern, it is digital, it is thrusting and it is prosperous.”Residents of the territory voted overwhelmingly to remain part of the EU in last year’s Brexit referendum.Gibraltar wants London to negotiate a “special status” with the EU for it after the British exit."

I was under pressure because we needed to take the lead, so I had to play a responsible knock which I did.""Earlier in the day, Pakistan too were struggling at 316-6 and were in danger of conceding a healthy lead with Herath using all his experience and guile.The 39-year-old left-arm spinner, who now has 394 wickets in 84 Tests, gave his team the much-needed wicket of a resolute Azhar Ali, luring him into an uppish drive which was brilliantly caught at short mid-wicket by a diving Mendis.Azhar´s defiant knock of 85 lasted more than five hours and included four boundaries, but with his dismissal, Pakistan´s hopes of building a lead looked slim.But Sohail had other ideas as he added an invaluable 50 for the ninth wicket with tail-ender Hasan Ali to lift Pakistan from 340-8.Sohail hit seven fours and two sixes before holing out to paceman Nuwan Pradeep, who finished with 2-77.Hasan´s whirlwind 25-ball 29 featured three sixes and two fours.The second and final Test — a day-night affair — will be played in Dubai from October 6."
580,"October 1 marked the 8th death anniversary of showman Syed Kamal. Known as Pakistan’s Raj Kapoor, Kamal acted in over 80 films, produced over a dozen and directed nine of them. He was destined for stardom, but had to find it the hard way.It was the mid 50s when Pakistan Industry was getting on its feet. Santosh Kumar, Darpan and Sudhir had established themselves as heroes, but they needed a sidekick to tickle the audience during the film. There was a need for a young ‘actor’ who could dance with friends, crack jokes at times, throw a few punches when required and woo the girl, when at peace.Santosh Kumar had the charm and charisma, but dance was never his forte. Sudhir knew how to fight and act but lacked in dance. Darpan was attractive, but fell behind in all the other departments. It was the year 1956, when two youngsters migrated from India to make a name in Pakistan. One was Ratan Kumar and the other was Syed Kamal. One was bound to make it big.Ratan Kumar, born as Syed Nazir Ali in 1941, made a name in 50s in India with Boot Polish and Do Bigha Zamin. It was his lifelong dream to become Raj Kapoor. Boot Polish was Raj Kapoor’s production in which Raj was not the hero, but did play a cameo. Ratan was ideal whenever the need for a child artiste came up, be it the young Dilip Kumar in Deedar or the child version of Bharat Bhushan in Baiju Bawra.On the other hand, Kamal managed to play a small part in another RK Production Jaagte Raho (1956). Kamal was a good seven years senior to Ratan; this age difference came in handy for him.Both did work with big stars of their times. Ratan shared screen with stalwarts like Balraj Sahini, Meena Kumari while Kamal was lucky to work with Ashok Kumar, Geeta Bali and Naseem Banu in Betaab way back in 1952.Both of them migrated at about the same time. Kamal was well built, in his mid-20s and resembled Raj Kapoor, unlike Rattan, who simply imitated the thespian. Ratan first worked in Baidari, which was lifted from Jaagriti, a film in which he had earlier worked in India. He was launched by his brother Wazir Ali’s production company Films Hayat in Nagin with Neelo in the lead. He did appear in Clerk, Aladin ka Beta (opposite Neelo), Do Ustaad (opposite Shamim Ara), Choti Ammi (opposite Rani) and Samira (opposite Zeba) but the boyish looks stayed with him. The 20-year-old Ratan could not become the ‘hero’ the cine-goers needed. When his face matured, he directed Dastaan in 1969, but the need for the hero was gone.Kamal, on the other hand, just had a face that resembled Raj Kapoor. He had no launching pad, no excellent directors like Khalil Kaiser (Nagin, Clerk), Rafiq Rizvi (Do Ustaad, Neelofer) to guide from behind the camera and no time on his hand. He simply had luck on his side, as journalist-turned-filmmaker Shabab Kairanvi asked to have a special song, ‘O meri nargis Aa ja, main baja raha hoon baja’, written, after casting an eye on Kamal.Kamal was cast as the hero in Thandi Sarak, a family comedy and for him, and there was no looking back. All the leading ladies with whom Ratan Kumar tried to make a successful pair with, were being cast with Kamal; Zeba (Tauba, Aashiyana), Shamim Ara (Zamana Kiya kahega, Savera), Neelo (Banjaran, Insaf) and Rani (Sanam, Joker).Kamal became the ‘hero’that was needed. He was synonymous to action films like Nehlay pe dehla, Zamana kia kahayga and Daal me kaala, his style was being copied by the youth, his comic timing was appreciated and his songs became a rage. Kamal was well established by 1965, and had no qualms in moving to production, despite the arrival of Waheed Murad and Nadeem on the scene.There is a huge list of songs that have been picturised on Kamal. Ahmed Rushdi remained his voice for over 25 years. The wife of Ratan Kumar decided to remake her husbands’ only hit film as a lead, ‘Nagin’ in 70s. Produced way back in 1959, Nagin was the directorial debut of Khalil Qaiser, who went on to produce Shaheed, Farangi and other challenging films. In 1976, Nagin was remade as Naag aur Nagin, with Rani and Waheed Murad becoming the ‘Sheesh Naags’ this time. Hasan Tariq, the then husband of Rani was taken aboard as director and Nisar Bazmi was signed as the music director.Despite the heavy cast, excellent music and superb direction, the film bombed at the box-office. Kamal replaced Ratan Kumar so aptly that a sure shot to success formula failed by the one-time leading star. Syed Kamal, on the other hand, ventured into the Punjabi films during the same period, and despite being alien to the language, was quite successful as a producer. He remained active in movies till 1986 and signed off with Siyaasat, his take on General elections loss in 1985.Syed Kamal died on October 1, 2009 at the age of 75, but he will live on in memory through his diverse cinematic legacy. "
581,"COX‘S BAZAR: The World Food Program (WFP) appealed on Sunday for 75 million dollars in emergency aid over the next six months to help alleviate the suffering of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar.Since August 25th, hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled their homes in majority Buddhist Myanmar, overwhelming aid agencies in neighbouring Bangladesh.“The bottom line? This is a deplorable situation. This is as bad as it gets. We need 75 million for the next six months,” David Beasley, WFP executive director, told reporters after visiting refugee camps in Bangladesh near the Myanmar border.“I say we can end world hunger with a few billion dollars. I tell donors, if you can’t give us the money, stop the wars,” added Beasley, whose U.N. agency is the main humanitarian organisation battling hunger worldwide.The United Nations is currently seeking 200 million dollars from donors to help tackle the crisis among the Rohingya Muslims."
582,"MADRID: Catalonia, which held a banned referendum on secession from Spain Sunday amid a police crackdown, is one of the powerhouses of the Spanish economy, buoyed by industry, research and tourism but burdened with a heavy debt.Contributing 19 percent of Spain´s GDP in 2016, Catalonia rivals Madrid for the distinction of being the richest region in the country.It is fourth in terms of GDP per capita with 28,600 euros ($33,600), after Madrid, the northern Basque Country and neighbouring Navarra. GDP per capita in Spain overall is 24,000 euros.Like in Madrid, unemployment is also lower than in the rest of the country: 13.2 percent in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 17.2 percent nationally.Catalonia is by far Spain´s top exporting region, with a quarter of all goods produced there sold abroad in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017.It attracted some 14 percent of foreign investment in Spain in 2015, in second place after Madrid, which received a huge 64 percent, but far ahead of all the other regions, according to the economy ministry´s latest data.Several large companies have their headquarters in Barcelona: textile group Mango, Spain´s third largest bank CaixaBank, Gas Natural, highway giant Abertis or perfume firm Puig, which owns Nina Ricci, Paco Rabanne and Jean-Paul Gaultier.The agri-food, chemistry and auto sectors are pillars of Catalan industry, which also has a big logistics hub.The biggest industrial sector in the region in terms of jobs and turnover is agri-food, buoyed by the powerful meat business which exports a lot of pork.Oil, food for cattle and grocery products also contribute.The region concentrates around half of all of Spain´s chemical production, with a major hub in Tarragona.According to the sector´s regional federation, turnover in Catalonia is higher than in Austria or Denmark.In 2016, the region was also the second car producer in Spain after Castilla y Leon. Nissan and Volkswagen, via its brand Seat, have factories there. Spain is the second biggest vehicle maker in the EU after Germany.Since the 1990s Catalonia has invested in research, particularly in bioscience -- genetics, neurosciences, cell biology -- and the sector now represents seven percent of its GDP.With many cutting-edge hospitals and research centres, including in the nuclear sector with a particle accelerator, the region says it is number one in Europe for pharmaceutical companies per capita.New technology is also very present in Barcelona, which every year hosts the Mobile World Congress.Catalan universities are among the best in the country: of the top five Spanish universities in the widely-watched annual ranking compiled by the independent Shanghai Ranking Consultancy, three are Catalan.These are Pompeu Fabra, the University of Barcelona and the Autonomous University of Barcelona.Its business schools -- Esade and IESE -- are well known and Barcelona also has big publishing houses.With its capital Barcelona and Costa Brava beaches, Catalonia is the Spanish region that most attracts foreign tourists and the trend is on the rise.More than 18 million visitors went in 2016, or a quarter of all foreigners who came to Spain.Its airport is the country´s second biggest after Madrid. In 2016, it handled more than 44 million passengers.It is particularly valued by low-cost carriers that want to make it a European hub for their long-distance flights to the Americas.Barcelona´s port is the third biggest in Spain for goods after Algeciras in the south and Valencia in the east, and one of the largest in Europe for cruise ships.Catalonia´s debt represents 35.4 percent of its GDP, which made it the third most indebted region in Spain in the second quarter of 2017, after Valencia and Castilla La Mancha.At the end of June, its debt stood at 76.7 billion euros.Ratings agencies have given it a low, speculative grade, which means Catalonia is not able to borrow directly on financial markets. So it depends on loans from the central Spanish state.The issue is much debated among both camps, who generally present widely different figures, often based on different methodologies and hypotheses.If independence were to happen, Spain´s economy ministry claims that Catalonia would leave the European Union, its GDP would fall 25 to 30 percent and unemployment would double.But some economists believe that the newly formed republic would stay in the EU, predicting its GDP would remain stable in the short term and rise seven percent long term.Catalonia´s government also says the region would no longer suffer from what it calls a ""fiscal deficit"", given that the region pays more in taxes to Madrid than it gets back.The regional executive says this deficit is around 16 billion euros, or 8 percent of Catalonia´s GDP and the central government, with a different methodology, estimates it to be 10 billion euros, or 5 percent of regional GDP."

He said the former premier's indictment has been deferred to October 9, the next date of hearing. He added that the court has been assured that Maryam and her husband MNA Capt (retd) Safdar will appear in court.He further said that Nawaz's request of exemption from personal appearance is also yet to be deliberated upon. Earlier, when Nawaz arrived at the court, around 2,000 personnel of the police and Rangers had been deployed in and around the judicial complex in Sector G-11 where the court is located.  Nawaz was accompanied by his political aide, Senator Asif Kirmani, and only his vehicle was allowed to enter the complex. Media representatives, as well as supporters of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and members of the government, were barred from entering the judicial complex. This resulted in a delay of other hearings scheduled inside the complex, as lawyers and litigants were also barred from entering. When Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal reached the complex, he too was barred by the Rangers from entering. Upon this, he ordered for the Rangers' commander, a Brigadier-ranked officer, to come out of the courtroom and discuss the matter with him. Several other senior government officials, including Federal Railways Minister Saad Rafique, Federal Privatisation Minister Daniyal Aziz, Senator Pervaiz Rasheed, State Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry, State CADD Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, MNA Maiza Hameed and Islamabad Mayor Sheikh Ansar Aziz, were not allowed to enter the complex. However, later, Daniyal and Maiza were escorted inside by a security official. Nawaz then left the court for Punjab House. Later, in a meeting with a delegation of court reporters, Accountability Court-I Judge Mohammad Bashir said he is unaware who ordered the Rangers to deploy at the court complex. He assured the media personnel that he would ensure arrangements are made so they can attend the next hearing.The Sharif family is facing references pertaining to their London apartments, Azizia Steel Mills and offshore companies filed against them by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).In the last hearing, the ousted prime minister was provided copies of references against him.Around 1,500 security personnel were deployed to secure the route from Punjab House to Sector G-11, where the court is located, as well as the courts complexOn September 26, the court had also issued bailable arrest warrants for his children and son-in-law as they failed to appear before it, despite two earlier summons.At the hearing, Nawaz's counsel, Khawaja Harris, pleaded the court to exempt his client from personal appearance. However, the judge observed that the matter would be deliberated upon once Nawaz has been indicted.However, speaking to supporters in Lahore on Sunday, Sharif said his children would return from London and appear before the court once his wife's health improves. He made the remarks after visiting the grave of his father along with his brother Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif.The former prime minister also held consultations with his political and legal aides on various issues after arriving in Islamabad on Sunday evening.Nawaz's appearance in court will follow the indictment of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar by the same judge last week in a reference pertaining to his owning 'assets beyond his known sources of income'.[embed_video1...Reports also state that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) will also hold meetings of its central working committee and general council today to appoint Nawaz as the party's president after his removal from office.Last week, the PML-N managed to amend the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017 in the opposition-controlled Senate in favour of Nawaz's bid to become the party president. The bill will now be taken up by the Lower House of Parliament, where the PML-N holds a majority, on Monday (today).NAB had in total filed three references against the Sharif family and one against Dar in the accountability court, in light of the Supreme Court's orders in the Panama Papers case verdict of July 28.The anti-graft body was given six weeks, from the date of the apex court's order, to file the reference in an accountability court while the accountability court was granted six months to wrap up the proceedings.Former PM and Punjab CM visited the grave of their father in Lahore todayThe references against the Sharif family pertain to the Azizia Steel Mills, their London properties and over dozen offshore companies.NAB's Rawalpindi branch prepared two references regarding the Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment, and the nearly dozen companies owned by the Sharif family.Its Lahore branch prepared a reference on the Sharif family's Avenfield apartments in London and another against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for owning assets beyond his known sources of income.If convicted, the accused may face up to 14 years imprisonment and lifelong disqualification from holding public office including the freezing of bank accounts and assets."
584,"WASHINGTON: Google announced new steps to help struggling news organisations Monday -- including an end to a longstanding ""first click free"" policy to generate fresh revenues for publishers hurt by the shift from print to digital.The moves come amid mounting criticism that online platforms are siphoning off the majority of revenues as more readers turn to digital platforms for news.""I truly believe that Google and news publishers actually share a common cause,"" said Google Vice President Philipp Schindler.""Our users truly value high quality journalism.""Google announced a series of measures, the most significant of which would be to replace the decade-old policy of requiring news organisations to provide one article discovered in a news search without subscribing -- a standard known as ""first click free.""This will be replaced by a ""flexible sampling"" model that will allow publishers to require a subscription if they choose at any time.""We realize that one size does not fit all,"" said Richard Gingras, Google´s vice president for news.This will allow news organisations to decide whether to show articles at no cost or to implement a ""paywall"" for some or all content.Gingras said the new policy, effective Monday, will be in place worldwide. He said it was not clear how many publishers would start implementing an immediate paywall as a result.""The reaction to our efforts has been positive,"" he told a conference call announcing the new policy.""This is not a silver bullet to the subscription market. It is a very competitive market for information. And people buy subscriptions when they have a perception of value.""Google said it is recommending a ""metering"" system allowing 10 free articles per month as the best way to encourage subscriptions.The California tech giant also said it would work with publishers to make subscriptions easier, including allowing readers to pay with their Google or Android account to avoid a cumbersome registration process.""We think we can get it down to one click, that would be superb,"" Gingras said.He explained people are becoming more accustomed to paying for news, but that a ""sometimes painful process of signing up for a subscription can be a turn off. That´s not great for users or for news publishers who see subscriptions as an increasingly important source of revenue.""Google would share data with the news organisations to enable them to keep up the customer relationship, he added.""We´re not looking to own the customer,"" he said. ""We will provide the name of user, the email and if necessary the address.""Gingras said Google is also exploring ways ""to use machine learning to help publishers recognise potential subscribers,"" employing the internet giant´s technology to help news organisations.He added that Google was not implementing the changes to generate revenues for itself, but that some financial details had not been worked out.Google does not intend to take a slice of subscription revenues, he noted.""Our intent is to be as generous as possible,"" he said.Research firm eMarketer estimates that Google and Facebook will take in 63 percent of digital advertising revenues in 2017 -- making it harder for news organisations to compete online.Facebook is widely believed to be working on a similar effort to help news organisations drive more subscriptions.Google created a ""Digital News Initiative"" in Europe in 2015 which provides funding for innovative journalism projects."
585,"POTCHEFSTROOM: South African fast bowler Morne Morkel took two wickets for no runs in the first over of Bangladesh´s second innings on the fourth day of the first Test at Senwes Park on Sunday, but then suffered an injury likely to keep him out of the rest of the match.Bangladesh were 49 for three at tea after being set to make 424 to win. Rain fell during the tea interval and prevented play from resuming on time.Morkel took two for 19 before leaving the field with a side strain after bowling two balls of his sixth over.Cricket South Africa media officer Lerato Malekutu said Morkel would be taken for scans on Monday and was unlikely to bowl again in the match.Morkel´s sensational start could have been even better because he was denied a third wicket because of a no-ball.Morkel, bowling around the wicket, bowled Tamim Iqbal with his fourth ball, a superb delivery which straightened off the pitch and hit the off stump. Two balls later he won a leg before wicket decision against another left-hander, Mominul Haque, who made top score of 77 in Bangladesh´s first innings.After consulting batting partner Imrul Kayes, Mominul did not seek a television review of umpire Chris Gaffaney´s decision - but replays showed the ball would have missed the leg stump.Switching to over the wicket, Morkel uprooted the middle stump of Mushfiqur Rahim, Bangladesh´s right-handed captain, with the second delivery of his next over. But a television check showed the bowler had over-stepped the bowling crease. A no-ball was called and Rahim was reprieved.It was a world record 14th occasion on which Morkel had been denied a Test wicket because of a no-ball.South Africa missed another chance when captain Faf du Plessis dropped Kayes at second slip off Kagiso Rabada when the batsman was on six. Kayes made 32 before he was caught behind off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj in the last over before tea.Du Plessis (81) and Temba Bavuma (71) set up South Africa´s second innings declaration on 247 for six with a fourth wicket partnership of 142 off 172 balls. The innings was interrupted for 47 minutes by a thunderstorm, which caused the tea interval to be delayed by an hour.Part-time left-arm spinner Mominul claimed a career-best three for 27 as South Africa chased quick runs. He had taken only four wickets in 23 previous Tests. By contrast, Mehidy Hasan, Bangladesh´s only front-line spinner, did not take a wicket and conceded 247 runs in 67 overs during the match - the third-highest number of runs conceded by a bowler without taking a wicket in a Test match."
586,"ISLAMABAD: Senator Pervaiz Rasheed on Monday called the hearing of three corruption references against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif ‘a hijacked trial’.Responding to a question outside the accountability court, Rasheed said: “it is not an open trial, in fact, it is a hijacked trial. The Supreme Court will tell you who hijacked it as the implementation of laws is their mandate.” He added that, “Today we are paying the price for our efforts for democracy in the country. And we will continue to pay this price.”He said that the court lockdown has clearly shown that in the last 70-year history of Pakistan, the “power rests with someone while the authority is enjoyed by the other”.Without taking the name of former president Gen (retd) Pervez Musharraf, who is also facing a number of court cases, he said a ""criminal has absconded and an innocent is in the court"".When asked why then interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan facilitated the exit of former military ruler out of the country, he said: “Nisar couldn’t help us, how could he help him in his release.”Separately, Federal Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique, while speaking to Geo News, said that the accountability court judge and Supreme Court's monitoring judge should take notice of this situation [of disallowing media and lawyers from attending the hearing].""Today we have seen a very unfortunate situation. We can’t see justice being served in the higher courts nor here,"" he said.Rafique said that he thinks that the situation is because of faulty local arrangements rather than orders from any high-ups.When asked to comment on Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal's threat of resignation, Rafique said it is understandable that Iqbal is upset, but ""resigning is not the answer...it is the easiest thing to do""."
587,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Ishaq Dar challenged on Monday his indictment by an accountability court hearing a corruption reference against him in Islamabad High Court (IHC).The corruption reference, pertaining to Dar's owning assets that are disproportionate to his known sources of income, was filed by the National Accountability Bureau in light of the Supreme Court's July 28 judgment in the Panama Papers case.Dar, in his petition, stated that he was indicted by the accountability court without giving him the mandated time and requested the IHC to suspend the indictment proceedings. The finance minister denied the charges and vowed to prove his innocence in courtThe finance minister said as he should be given time to file his response on the case, the IHC should order the accountability court to suspend its trial proceedings until a decision on his petition.During the hearing of the accountability court earlier, Dar's counsel asked the judge to be granted seven days for perusing the reference against his client but the judge denied the request, observing that the court has to complete the trial in six months as per the apex court's directions.""If you take a month to read the reference how will we wrap up proceedings in the given time,"" the judge asked, observing further that two days are enough to go over the reference.The judge observed that they will conduct daily hearings in the case and also directed Dar to deposit a Rs5 million surety bond to ensure his appearance at the hearings."
588,"CAIRO: Egyptian militant group Hasm claimed responsibility on Sunday for a small explosion at Myanmar’s embassy in Cairo, saying it was in retaliation for that country’s military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims.Egypt’s interior ministry has not commented on Saturday’s blast, which residents and media initially reported as probably the result of a faulty gas pipeline. Two security sources told Reuters that traces of explosives had been found at the scene.“This bombing serves as a warning to the embassy of murderers, killers of women and children in the Muslim Rakhine State, and in solidarity with the sons of this weakened Muslim population,” Hasm said in its statement.It was the first time that Hasm, a group blamed for several attacks targeting judges and policemen around Cairo since last year, has claimed an attack on a civilian target.“(We have used) utmost caution to ensure that there were no civilian casualties or innocent people (hurt) during the operation, or else you would have seen a burning hell you could not have stopped,” Hasm said in the statement.Myanmar’s government spokesman urged citizens abroad to be careful.“Pls take care Myanmar nationals around the world,” the spokesman, Zaw Htay, said on his Twitter feed.The latest wave of violence in western Myanmar’s Rakhine State began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army camp, killing about 12 people.The Myanmar military response has sent more than 410,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh, escaping what they and rights monitors say is a campaign aimed at driving the Muslim population out of the majority-Buddhist country.Egypt accuses Hasm of being a militant wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group it outlawed in 2013. The Muslim Brotherhood denies this.Hundreds of Egyptian soldiers and police have been killed fighting an Islamist insurgency in Sinai that has gained pace since mid-2013, when General-turned-President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi ousted Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood after mass protests against his rule."
589,"GAZA: Hamas freed five prisoners belonging to the rival Fatah party on Sunday and Egypt sent a delegation to the Gaza Strip to oversee the Islamist group’s planned handover of administrative control of the Palestinian enclave to a unity government.The West Bank-based Palestinian prime minister, Rami al-Hamdallah, and other officials of the government formed in 2014 are due in Gaza on Monday to run ministries and hold a cabinet meeting the next day.Hamas opted for reconciliation with Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah because it is short of funds and friends a decade after seizing the enclave in a brief civil war.“We are determined to ... bury the chapter of division so that the homeland can be reunited,” Hamdallah said in public remarks in the West Bank city of Ramallah.One cabinet member, Culture Minister Ehab Bseisso, arrived in Gaza on Sunday and held a meeting with deputies and employees after taking up his post.Hamas made its dramatic turn towards reconciliation on Sept. 17 after Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates imposed an economic boycott on the movement’s main donor, Qatar, over alleged support of terrorists.Abbas, whose popularity ratings are low, has been facing public pressure to patch up differences with Hamas.Hamas’s armed wing still remains the dominant power in the territory of 2 million people partially blockaded by Israel and Egypt, which cite security concerns for border restrictions.On the eve of the handover, Hamas released five Fatah security men it jailed two years ago for what an Interior Ministry spokesman described as “actions harmful to internal security”. Their sentences ranged from seven to 15 years.Speaking to reporters, one of the freed inmates, Taher Abu Armana, thanked Hamas Gaza chief Yehya Al-Sinwar and Mohammed Dahlan, a former Fatah security chief in the enclave, for his release.Dahlan, based since 2011 in the United Arab Emirates, is behind an influx of cash to prop up Gaza and detente between Hamas and Arab states including Egypt, which hosted reconciliation talks.“We urge President (Mahmoud Abbas) to order the release of all political prisoners in the West Bank,” Abu Armana said, a reference to members of Hamas, a group considered by Western countries that back Abbas to be a terrorist organizations.An official of the Palestinian Authority, the self-rule body headed by Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said an Egyptian delegation comprised of two generals and Cairo’s ambassador to Israel, arrived in Gaza to oversee reconciliation efforts.It was the first official Egyptian delegation to travel to Gaza since 2012. Egypt suspended its diplomatic mission in Gaza in 2007 after the Hamas takeover."
590,"The five-year-old Rohingya boy was so emaciated that doctors could not insert a drip into his tiny arm, one of thousands of children facing life-threatening malnutrition in overstretched Bangladeshi refugee camps.""He said he hadn't eaten anything in eight days. Nothing,"" said Dr SK Jahidur Rahman at a clinic run by Bangladeshi medical charity Gonoshasthaya Kendra.The lucky ones make it to the overwhelmed clinics just in time. But some are not so fortunate, dying before help can reach them or forced to beg by the roadside.The UN says more than 14,100 children are at risk of dying from malnutrition in wretched camps where half a million mainly Rohingya refugees depend entirely on charities for survival.Food distribution in the vastly overcrowded settlements is still ad hoc and uncoordinated, the UN says, more than a month after refugees began pouring into southern Bangladesh to escape ethnic bloodshed in Myanmar.Huge crowds descend on aid deliveries and soldiers need to herd starving people into bamboo pens where they squat cheek by jowl under the scorching sun for a meal.Many go hungry as charities scramble to feed 500,000 mouths every day.Children make up the bulk of new arrivals and are most vulnerable to the paucity of food, with 145,500 infants under five needing urgent intervention to stave off malnutrition, aid agencies say.""Lots of children are showing all the signs of hunger and malnutrition, which is an alarming prospect when they've just fled so much horror,"" said Save the Children's emergency health unit director Dr Unni Krishnan.In a field clinic for infants suffering the severest malnutrition, Monura tried to soothe her gaunt 13-month-old daughter Rian Bebe, whose cheekbones jutted out below sunken eyes.A nurse wrapped a measuring tape around her pencil-thin arm and placed her tiny frame on the scales -- 5.5 kilograms, less than the weight of a healthy child half her age.Monura, who like many Rohingya uses one name, said she had little to feed her desperately hungry child on the five-day trek from Myanmar.""Most sip a little water and walk five days,"" said Dr Rahman. ""They hide in the jungle, chewing wood, anything, to beat hunger.""Many Rohingya children were already malnourished before making the perilous journey to Bangladesh, doctors say. Their health has since deteriorated further.The Rohingya come from impoverished Rakhine , where state-imposed restrictions have ensured abysmal living standards for the persecuted Muslim community.Their children's immune systems are already weakened, leaving them defenceless should a disease outbreak sweep through the camps as charities fear.Monura's little girl, chewing on a high-calorie paste, has been rescued just in time and should make a slow recovery.But for others it is a different story.In the largest district hospital in Cox's Bazar, a skeletal eight-month-old girl died after being admitted with severe malnutrition and pneumonia contracted in her enfeebled state.""Skin and bones,"" lamented Shaheen Abdur Rahman, the hospital's resident medical officer, of the dying girl brought to his ward.""It was a very grave condition.""Others drift through the camps desperately seeking food among the chaotic throngs and begging people in passing cars for morsels.On a roadside near rolling hills of refugee shanties, 15-year-old Sitara Banu worried endlessly about her weak five-month-old son Jahidur Rahman.""He can't get enough milk. I can't manage to get any food for myself either. I fed him a little banana someone gave me, but that made him sicker,"" she told AFP.In a nearby canteen, men in singlets sweated over huge cauldrons, toiling throughout the night to make rice, meat and lentils.""They will be working for months like this. It is very hard work to cook for 10,000 people,"" said Abdul Mukit, a volunteer overseeing the kitchen run by Turkish government aid body Tika.It is a drop in the ocean given the sheer scale of the crisis.But for thousands of children, most of whom survive on boiled rice and high-energy biscuits when they can get them, this could be their only proper meal of the day.As a truck carrying the 40 kilogramme pots approached a relief distribution area, children swarmed the sun-baked clearing from all directions, naked toddlers struggling to keep up with the surge.Corralled into queues by the military, they sprinted to the volunteers clutching outstretched plates, buckets and plastic bags -- whatever they had to hand.""It makes me feel good,"" said head chef Manzar Alam of his part in feeding the youngsters, who carefully take their curry and rice back to their shanties."

If Rangers have refused to observe orders, a high-level inquiry will be held and we will see who has challenged the writ of the government,"" said a visibly upset Iqbal. ""I waited for the Rangers commander for 15 minutes, this is unacceptable, Whosoever has done this, disciplinary action will be taken against him. I will resign as I will not be a puppet minister. ""A force that is subordinate to me has to follow my orders. There cannot be two states [within a state],"" said Iqbal.Earlier, Iqbal explained that it is the right of Nawaz's supporters, legal aides and media to attend the hearing as ""closed trials are a hallmark of martial laws"". He said the commissioner had made special arrangements for those who wanted to attend the hearing as space is limited. Later, Iqbal also admonished an assistant commissioner for the state of affairs, asking the official to give him what has occurred today in writing so Iqbal could ""sort them out"". The minister said this is not a banana republic, it is a constitutional republic.Once Iqbal had left the premises, the Rangers' brigadier stepped out of the complex to inquire into the situation and spoke to Federal Minister Daniyal Aziz. However, soon a number of media personnel and lawyers surrounded them and began chanting ""shame, shame"", after which the officer went back to the court complex.When the hearing of corruption cases began earlier today, the security personnel did not allow any media persons of PML-N supporters to enter the premises. When the interior minister reached the complex, he too, was barred by the Rangers from entering. Upon this, he ordered for the Rangers' commanding officer, a Brigadier-ranked officer, to come out of the courtroom and discuss the matter with him. However, that did not happen all of a sudden. Iqbal, who is the head of paramilitary forces, including Rangers, was accompanied by State Interior Minister Talal Chaudhry and others. "
593,"BARCELONA: No supporters were able to watch Barcelona’s 3-0 win over Las Palmas on Sunday as the game was played behind closed doors, following clashes between police and voters in Catalonia over a disputed independence referendum.Spanish riot police burst into polling stations across Catalonia, confiscating ballot boxes and voting papers to try to halt the banned referendum on a split from Spain as Madrid asserted its authority over the rebel region. Catalan officials said 337 people were injured in the crackdown.The clashes prompted Barcelona, the club of the Catalan capital, to announce the Las Palmas match would be played in front of an empty Nou Camp stadium.“FC Barcelona condemns the events which have taken place in many parts of Catalonia today in order to prevent its citizens exercising their democratic right to free expression,” the club said on its website.“Given the exceptional nature of events, the Board of Directors have decided that the FC Barcelona first-team game against Las Palmas will be played behind closed doors following the Professional Football League’s refusal to postpone the game.”The lack of fans in the Nou Camp, which has a capacity of 99,000, seemed not to harm Barcelona on the pitch as Sergio Busquets opened the scoring early in the second half.Top scorer Lionel Messi then struck twice to seal Barca’s seventh straight win of the Liga season which extended their lead at the top of the table to five points.Las Palmas had said earlier in the day that they would wear the Spanish flag on their jerseys for the match to support the unity of Spain. “We decided to wear a small Spanish flag on our shirts today to display unequivocally our hope in the future of this country,” their statement said.The game was thrown into chaos when reports in the Spanish media said the club had postponed the game less than an hour before kick off, and supporters were not allowed through the Nou Camp gates.Both Las Palmas and Barcelona published their starting lineups for the game, with the announcement that the game would go ahead without supporters coming 25 minutes before kickoff.Spanish soccer federation rules state that a game can only be postponed if the police cannot guarantee the safety of spectators.If Barcelona had suspended the game without the consent of the federation, they would have automatically lost the game 3-0 and had a further three points deducted.Barcelona supporters group Grada d‘Animacio, which organises the “singing section” behind one of the goals at the Nou Camp, pledged to invade the pitch, if the game went ahead, in protest at the police crackdown.Former Barcelona captain Xavi Hernandez also condemned the police action, in a video released on social media.“What is happening in Catalonia today is shameful,” said Xavi, who has made more appearances for Barcelona than any other player.“It’s unacceptable that people are not allowed to vote in a democratic country. All my support goes to the people who are peacefully trying to exercise their right to vote. Long live Catalonia.”"
594,"MADRID: Spain’s northeastern region of Catalonia failed to hold an independence referendum on Sunday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said, after more than 760 people were injured in clashes between police and voters during a ballot Madrid said was illegal.The people of Catalonia had been tricked into taking part in the banned vote, Rajoy said, adding that the referendum was a strategy by the regional government against legality and democratic harmony and was a “path that leads to nowhere”.Rajoy thanked security forces for upholding the law and doing their job.He also called to meet with all Spanish political parties to discuss the country’s future following the referendum."
595,"BARCELONA: A total of 761 people needed assistance from Catalonia’s Medical Emergency Systems, according to the Catalan department of health, The Guardian reported.A total of 335 have been hurt in Barcelona alone after Spanish riot police fired rubber bullets and forced their way into activist-held polling stations in Catalonia on Sunday as thousands flooded the streets to vote in an independence referendum banned by Madrid.Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, in a press conference, said 'no referendum has been held in Catalonia today'.The large majority of Catalonia did not want to participate in today’s referendum and they had obeyed the law, he added.In Barcelona, people gathered to watch Rajoy’s speech on a big screen. When he said that the majority of people had not wanted to participate in the referendum, the crowd reacted with derision and anger.The Catalan government’s pollster recently found that 70% wanted a referendum on the territory’s future, although support for independence is only 41%.""Spanish democracy faces its greatest challenge,"" headlined top-selling El Pais daily just hours before police moved in en masse to seal off polling stations and seize ballot boxes, sparking scuffles as they sought to block the vote.More than 5.3 million people have been called upon to have their say on independence from Spain in the wealthy northeastern region which has its own distinct language and culture.The referendum poses the question: ""Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?""But it has been ruled unconstitutional by the central government and the courts, with judicial officials ordering police to seize ballot papers, detain key organisers and shut down websites promoting the vote.Thousands of Spanish police fanned out across the region on Sunday, forcing their way into polling stations.In central Barcelona, riot police charged at demonstrators who were sitting on the ground blocking their way after they raided a polling station at a school, witnesses said.They said police also fired rubber bullets, with one man showing AFP a leg injury he suffered.The crackdown drew a sharp rebuke from Catalan leaders.""The unjustified use of violence, which is both irrational and irresponsible, by the Spanish state will not stop the will of the Catalan people,"" Catalan president Carles Puigdemont said.The police, he said, had used ""batons, rubber bullets and indiscriminate force"" against people demonstrating ""peacefully"".""The head of a cowardly government has flooded our city with police,"" Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau wrote on Twitter, adding: ""Barcelona city of peace, we are not afraid"" -- a slogan coined after August´s jihadist rampage that killed 16 people.The Catalan government had scheduled voting to open at 9am (0700 GMT) at around 2,300 designated stations, but Madrid said on Saturday it had shut more than half of them.Voting started at some sites in the region on Sunday after people had occupied them with the aim of preventing police from locking them down. Organisers smuggled in ballot boxes before dawn and urged voters to use passive resistance against police.Catalan leaders vowed to press ahead with the vote despite Spanish attempts to thwart preparations, including the seizure of ballot papers and boxes, and it said it would give an estimate of the early turn-out later in the morning.The Catalan government said voters could print out ballot papers at home and lodge them at any polling station not closed down by police.“I have got up early because my country needs me,” said Eulalia Espinal, a 65-year-old pensioner who started queuing with around 100 others outside one polling station, a Barcelona school, in rain at about 5am (0300 GMT).“We don’t know what’s going to happen but we have to be here,” she said.Organisers had asked voters to turn out before dawn, hoping for large crowds to be the world’s first image of voting day.“This is a great opportunity. I’ve waited 80 years for this,” said 92-year-old Ramon Jordana, a former taxi driver waiting to vote in Sant Pere de Torello, a town in the foothills of the Pyrenees and a pro-independence bastion.He had wrapped his wrists in Catalan flags, among 100-150 people who gathered at a local school that had been listed as a polling station, ready to block any police from entering. A tractor also stood guard, though no police had yet arrived.Leading up to the referendum, Spanish police arrested Catalan officials, seized campaigning leaflets and occupied the Catalan government’s communications hub.But Catalan leaders urged voters to turn out in a peaceful expression of democracy. Families have occupied scores of schools earmarked as voting centres, sleeping overnight in an attempt to prevent police from sealing them off.If some voting goes ahead, a “yes” result is likely, given that many unionists are not expected to turn out.“If I can’t vote, I want to turn out in the streets and say sincerely that we want to vote,” said independence supporter Jose Miro, a 60-year-old schools inspector.The pro-independence Catalan leader originally said that if the “yes” vote won, the Catalan government would declare independence within 48 hours, but regional leaders have since acknowledged Madrid’s crackdown has undermined the vote.Markets have reacted cautiously but calmly to the situation so far, though credit rating agency S&P said on Friday that protracted tensions in Catalonia could hurt Spain’s economic outlook. The region accounts for about a fifth of the economy.The ballot will have no legal status as it has been blocked by Spain’s Constitutional Court, and Madrid has the ultimate power under its 1978 charter to suspend the regional government’s authority to rule if it declares independence.The Madrid government, which has sent thousands of police to Catalonia to enforce a court ban on the vote, believes it has done enough to prevent any meaningful referendum taking place.A minority of around 40 percent of Catalans support independence, polls show, although a majority want to hold a referendum on the issue. The region of 7.5 million people has an economy larger than that of Portugal."
596,"CARACAS: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Sunday slammed his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy for trying to halt a banned independence referendum in Catalonia, saying the conservative leader was a hypocrite for supporting Venezuela’s opposition while cracking down on dissent at home.Spain has been a vocal critic of leftist Maduro, accusing him of undermining Venezuela’s democracy and plunging the country’s 30 million people into suffering due to food and medicine shortages.Maduro seized on the images of Spanish riot police bursting into polling stations across Catalonia on Sunday, confiscating ballot boxes and voting papers, as evidence that it is Rajoy who lacks democratic credentials.Spanish riot police burst into polling stations across Catalonia on Sunday, seizing ballot boxes and voting papers to prevent a banned referendum on a split from Spain.Some 761 people were injured in clashes with riot police, the regional government said.“Who is the dictator?” Maduro asked at the start of his hours-long Sunday television show.“Mariano Rajoy has chosen blood, sticks, blows, and repression against a noble people. Our hand goes out to the people of Catalonia. Resist, Catalonia! Latin America admires you,” added Maduro.Venezuela’s opposition, in turn, accused Maduro of hypocrisy in attacking Rajoy, saying the Venezuelan leader violently clamped down on four months of protests demanding humanitarian aid, early elections, and respect for the opposition-led Congress."
597,"Sunday marks a quarter century since the Cartoon Network burst upon the pastel-colored landscape of American television animation, redefining the way kids' entertainment was beamed into homes.Launched when ratings for morning cartoons were dropping and ""The Simpsons"" was starting to dominate primetime, many thought Turner Broadcasting Systems's $320 million purchase of the Hanna-Barbera library was lunacy.But Ted Turner, whose company already owned extensive back catalogues from MGM and Warner Bros., believed there was a gap in the market for a round-the-clock, seven-day channel showing cartoons that young and old could enjoy.His vision has been spectacularly vindicated, with CN growing from a modest start-up to one of cable TV's most popular programmers, seen in around 100 million American homes and in more than 170 other countries.""The thing that separates us is that we have artists driving the process here for everything,"" chief content officer Rob Sorcher told AFP and other media outlets on a recent tour of its headquarters in Burbank, California.""That is a fundamental difference from most other studios, because the artists are telling the stories through drawings. There aren't scripts getting done in most cases, and then animators animating them.""In its infancy, the network showed re-runs of ""The Flintstones,"" ""The Jetsons,"" ""Scooby Doo Where Are You!,"" ""Tom and Jerry,"" ""Popeye"" and many other classics.It went into original programming with ""The Moxy Show"" in December 1993, following up with ""Space Ghost Coast to Coast"" and, from 1997, ""Johnny Bravo,"" which raised eyebrows with its adult humor but became iconic.More recently the network has churned out numerous hits including ""Steven Universe,"" ""Star Wars: Clone Wars,"" ""Powerpuff Girls,"" ""Regular Show"" and ""Adventure Time.""""Ben 10,"" its longest-running franchise about a boy that can turn into aliens, has enjoyed widespread critical acclaim, winning three Emmys, with the associated merchandising estimated to have been worth almost $5 billion.Writer Steven T. Seagle, whose Man of Action Entertainment studio produces the show, said one of the challenges has been to crank up the pace for viewers who are getting increasingly quicker at devouring information in the smartphone age.""When I was a kid, if I found out about something I liked, I'd have to go to a library which might take a day to get to. I'd have to find some book somewhere and read it,"" he said.""Now if anything peaks their fancy, they usually have a device, they find out about it immediately and they exhaust it. They're through it completely by the end of the day and on to something else.""Marking CN out from other animation studios, the network has a ""shorts unit"" in which artists aren't expected to pitch their ideas, instead just making their seven-minute films and then showing the executives the result.It is a process that has spawned nine full series -- including big hits like ""We Bare Bears"" -- and accounts for 80 percent of the company's development of new projects.""We Bare Bears"" -- about the adventures of three ursine brothers -- is made by Annie Award-winning creator Daniel Chong, 38, whose credits include Pixar's ""Inside Out"" and ""Cars 2,"" and Disney's ""Bolt.""- Creative control -""It's great to be part of the Pixar machine -- but it is a machine. You're taking a script and boarding it at the behest of the director,"" he said.""I'm now in control of the product, every decision goes through me. We don't have the budget of Pixar or the time, but I get to tell the stories that interest me.""With many entertainment networks losing primetime viewership, CN has been making gains, finishing number one among ad-supported cable networks in its core kids 6-11 demo for the first time in 2015.As well as competition from traditional rivals like Nickelodeon, CN is under increasing pressure from Netflix's burgeoning slate of children's programming, not to mention Google's YouTube Kids and many other video apps.Keen to stay ahead, CN delivered triple-digit growth in 2015 for its app and, earlier this year, launched TV/mobile app hybrid ""OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes"" -- about a young wannabe who lives in a world populated by superheroes.While it may be a brave new world in terms of technology, some things never change, says ""OK K.O.!"" creator Ian Jones-Quartey, whose team spends about nine months making each 11-minute episode.""Our method of working on the cartoons is we sit in a room, we look at pictures and drawings and we pitch them to each other, and we work on the jokes individually,"" the 33-year-old said.""That's the same exact way Warner Bros. cartoons were made back in the day. That's how all the Disney movies were made, like 'Pinocchio,' 'Snow White' -- all those cartoons."""
598,"Formula One inspectors have given the Sepang circuit the all-clear, race organisers said Saturday, after a loose drain caused a shocking tyre explosion during Malaysian Grand Prix practice on Friday.Romain Grosjean's Haas was flung into the barriers at high speed on Friday after a drain grille, which should have been welded down securely, popped up at a kerb on turn nine after Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari drove over it.""All drain covers were inspected last night. It was reinforced -- double checked, triple checked,"" the Sepang circuit's CEO Razlan Razali told AFP on Saturday.""If FIA do not say anything the race is good to go. We only listen to the FIA,"" he added ahead of Saturday's final practice and qualifying sessions.In the freak incident, Grosjean's car spun after he hit the raised metal drain cover at more than 200kph (124mph) causing huge damage to his Haas.The impact instantly ripped his right rear tyre from its rim and sent the out-of-control car careering into the safety barriers with an impact estimated at 17G (17 times the force of gravity).Following the Frenchman's crash, safety officials spent Friday evening checking every drain cover at the 5.543-kilometre circuit.""All drain covers were inspected last night. It was reinforced, double checked … triple checked,"" Razlan said, adding that there had been an FIA inspection earlier in the week which had declared the track safe.""On Thursday, the FIA did a track inspection. We got a clean go to race,"" he said.The FIA stewards at Sepang gave Haas special permission to repair Grosjean's car due to the unusual nature of the incident.Under F1 rules, teams must normally observe a strict overnight curfew, during which they are not permitted to work on their cars.Officials said in a statement that it was because they ""consider that the circumstances causing the crash of Car 8 were entirely and clearly beyond the control of the Driver and the Competitor.""It came after an angry Haas team principal Guenther Steiner slammed the state of the track.""Thank God he didn’t get hurt or anything,"" he said Friday.""The car is damaged, in my opinion, things like this in 2017 shouldn’t happen on a permanent circuit, they shouldn’t happen on any circuit. This is, in my opinion, not acceptable. This is not up to the standards."""
599,"ISLAMABAD: Ahsan Iqbal — the Federal Minister of Interior — on Sunday underscored that some unknown people have recently been making negative posts on social media specifically aimed at the military under the banner of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).Iqbal said the fact that some rogue elements — which are not affiliated with the PML-N — are publishing these posts on various social media channels under the banner of the incumbent ruling party is condemnable and despicable, especially with regard to the ongoing political scenario.""Such actions are unsettling since people and the Pakistan Army are together in the war against terrorism,"" the interior minister explained.Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif, in line with Iqbal's statement, added that some ignoble people through the use of fake social media accounts are trying to create dissent in an environment where the Army is already engaged in maintaining stability in Pakistan.Asif also slammed the actions of these unidentified elements, adding that they worsen an already tense political scenario.In light of Muharram, on the other hand, Asif said, ""Thank God, the Ashura processions went by peacefully and there was no untoward event.""The foreign minister praised the overall performance of authorities during Ashura and mentioned that the efforts of the provincial governments, police, and other law enforcement agencies are commendable.Earlier today, Iqbal also clarified that the term ""in-house cleaning"" refers to strength. He was talking with regard to an earlier statement made by Asif.A few days back, Asif had said the civil and military leadership are on the same page with regard to how Pakistan has to make a clean break from its past."

603,"Several left-wing Spanish politicians on Sunday demanded Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy resign after police used force to block voting in a banned independence referendum in Catalonia, injuring dozens of people.Barcelona mayor Ada Colau said Rajoy, the leader of the ruling conservative Popular Party (PP), ""had crossed all red lines"".""He is a coward who does not live up to his state responsibilities... as a result he must resign,"" she told reporters.Colau demanded that police stop their crackdown against the referendum, which Spain's central government and the courts have deemed illegal.At least 92 people were injured in Catalonia in clashes between police and protesters over the vote, two of them seriously, a spokeswoman for the Catalan government's health department said.Spain's interior ministry said 12 police officers had been injured in the clashes.Police have baton-charged and fired rubber bullets to disperse crowds protecting polling stations in Barcelona and other towns and cities.Videos posted on social media show police dragging voters from polling stations by their hair, throwing people downstairs and attacking Catalan firefighters who were protecting polling stations.""To open a new scenario of dialogue and coexistence, it is necessary to send the PP and Ciudadanos to the opposition,"" Pablo Iglesias, the leader of far-left party Podemos, said on Twitter in reference to the PP's allies in parliament.""If something breaks Spain it will be because the PP and those who support it in parliament continue to destroy democracy,"" he added in messages accompanied by pictures of injured protesters, some of them bleeding.Pablo Echenique, a leading member of Podemos, wrote on Facebook that the PP's policies in Catalonia, could ""fracture a society and destroy a country"".""You have to remove the tumour before it kills the patient,"" he added.PP spokesman Fernando Martinez-Maillo defended the government, saying that ""the only ones responsible for what is happening in Catalonia today is (Catalan president Carles) Puigdemont, the government of Catalonia and its partners."""
604,"Shock rocker Marilyn Manson was rushed to a hospital and halted his tour Sunday after being crushed under a falling stage prop during a concert in New York.Manson's guitarist, Tyler Bates, indicated that the injuries were serious enough to stop concerts but were not life-threatening.The tour ""is on pause for a minute. Heading home. Manson will be back in action soon,"" Bates, who is based in Los Angeles, wrote on Instagram Sunday as he posted a picture from an airport.The theatrical Manson is known for his violent imagery, but the crowd soon realized that the incident was no stunt and his show Saturday evening at the 2,200-capacity Hammerstein Ballroom in Midtown Manhattan.Video footage posted by several fans showed Manson singing his band's cover of the Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These)"" in front of a stage prop of two giant pistols pointing in opposite directions.After screaming out the line, ""Some of them want to be abused!"" Manson appears to try to climb onto the gun sculpture, whose backing ladder then falls over him.The band played on for about 20 seconds as crew raced on the scene. The venue then went completely dark as Manson was taken away.A representative for the singer said only that he was taken to a hospital.The incident is the second in as many days for the 48-year-old singer, whose real name is Brian Warner.On Friday night in Pittsburgh, Manson was nearing the end of his set when he slipped from the stage as he reached out to touch fans. Manson is seen in a video limping back and telling the crowd that he broke his ankle, although he appeared fully mobile a day later in New York.The injuries come as Manson prepares to release his 10th studio album, ""Heaven Upside Down,"" on Friday. He has tour dates scheduled through December across North America and Europe.Manson, who generally paints his face hauntingly pale with heavy eyeliner, has frequently triggered controversy for dabbling in the occult. Past performances of the self-styled ""Antichrist Superstar"" have included ripping pages out of a Bible."
605,"LONDON: Three Miami Dolphins players knelt for the American national anthem before their NFL game in London on Sunday, after U.S. President Donald Trump had said the previous day that it was “very important” that players stood.Julius Thomas, Michael Thomas, and Kenny Stills all knelt during the anthem before kickoff at Wembley Stadium in the game between the New Orleans Saints and Miami. They then stood for the playing of the British national anthem.All Saints players stood locking arms, having knelt as a team shortly before the anthem in a pre-planned moment.On Saturday, Trump posted on Twitter, “Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!”Trump later tweeted a video of fans and players standing at an NHL game and wrote: “19,000 RESPECTING our National Anthem!”Other Twitter users posted that the video Trump put up was nearly a year old.Drew Brees — the New Orleans quarterback — had posted on Twitter earlier in the week that his team would kneel together before the anthem and then stand during it to show “respect for all”.After the game — in which Saints shut out the Dolphins 20-0, New Orleans coach Sean Payton praised his team for their show of solidarity.“It’s a credit to our leadership on the team, and we just felt like they were going to meet and spend some time on it and come up with a plan and we were going to be really unified and I thought it went really well. I was proud of the leadership on the team,” he said.In a gesture initiated last season by the then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, several NFL players have routinely knelt on one knee during the playing of the American anthem.It is intended to call attention to what the protesting players see as a pattern of racism in the treatment of African-Americans by U.S. police.The issue was exacerbated last week when Trump used abusive words for the players and said the ones, who did not stand during the anthem, should be fired.Dolphins owner Stephen Ross supported his players who chose to kneel last year and said this week he will continue to do so this season."
606,"BARCELONA: Catalonia’s regional leader opened the door to a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain on Sunday after voters defied a violent police crackdown and, according to regional officials, voted 90 percent in favour of breaking away.Despite Spanish police using batons and rubber bullets to disrupt the banned referendum, which was declared unconstitutional by Madrid, the Catalan government said 2.26 million people had cast ballots, a turnout of about 42 percent.Carles Puigdemont’s comments followed a television address by Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy who ruled out independence and accused separatists of trying to “blackmail ... the whole nation”. He offered all-party talks on the region’s future.Catalan officials say more than 800 people were injured in clashes with Spanish riot police during the referendum, which has pitched the country into its deepest constitutional crisis in decades and deepened a rift between Madrid and Barcelona.“On this day of hope and suffering, Catalonia’s citizens have earned the right to have an independent state in the form of a republic,” Puigdemont said in a televised address.“My government, in the next few days will send the results of today’s vote to the Catalan Parliament, where the sovereignty of our people lies, so that it can act in accordance with the law of the referendum,” he said.The law of the referendum, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, foresees a unilateral declaration of independence by the Catalan parliament if the majority votes to leave Spain. The law does not set a minimum turnout for the outcome to be valid.The results announced early on Monday were not a surprise, given that many unionists were not expected to turn out to vote.Earlier in the day, the streets of Catalonia, an industrial and tourism powerhouse accounting for a fifth of Spain’s economy, erupted into violence as national police burst into polling stations with batons, dragging voters away.The action drew criticism at home and abroad. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson voiced worries over the violence while backing Madrid’s view that the vote was unconstitutional.Spain’s deputy prime minister said force used by the police had been proportionate.“The absolute irresponsibility of the regional government has had to be met by the security forces of the state,” said Soraya Saenz de Santamaria.The euro lost about a third of a US cent after the violence-marred vote before steadying. It touched a low of $1.1776 in thin Asian trade but soon steadied at $1.1801.In the run-up to the referendum, Puigdemont had said he would move to a declaration of independence within 48 hours of a “yes” vote. But the fragmented nature of the polling, with many voting stations closed, could complicate any move to a formal declaration.Puigdemont called on Europe to step in to make sure fundamental rights were fully respected.In another sign tensions would endure beyond the vote, secessionist groups and trade unions in Catalonia called a general strike for Tuesday, La Vanguardia newspaper said.Catalan officials said 844 people had been injured in the police crackdown and the Spanish Interior Ministry said 12 police officers had been hurt.“I propose that all political parties with parliamentary representation meet and, together, reflect on the future we all face,” Rajoy said in his televised address.Opinion polls had shown around 40 percent of the northeastern region wanted independence from Spain although a majority were in favour of a referendum on the issue.National police sent into Catalonia for the referendum swept into polling stations, hitting people with batons, firing rubber bullets into crowds and forcibly removing would-be voters from polling stations, some dragged away by their hair.“Regardless of views on independence, we should all condemn the scenes being witnessed and call on Spain to change course before someone is seriously hurt,” Scotland’s pro-independence leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said on Twitter.Despite the national police action, some polling stations remained open, especially in areas supervised by the Catalan police force which adopted much milder tactics.“I‘m so pleased because despite all the hurdles they’ve put up, I’ve managed to vote,” said Teresa, a 72-year-old pensioner in Barcelona who had stood in line for six hours to vote.The ballot will have no legal status as it has been blocked by Spain’s Constitutional Court which ruled it at odds with the 1978 constitution that effectively restored democracy in Spain after the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco."
607,"GENEVA: The humanitarian situation in Yemen is a “catastrophe”, and cholera cases could reach a million by the end of the year, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday.Warring parties in Yemen - including the western-backed Saudi-led coalition - are all using disproportionate force, leading to “very excessive” civilian casualties, said Alexandre Faite, the head of the Red Cross delegation in Yemen.In addition, suspected cases of cholera have reached 750,000, with 2,119 deaths, Faite said, and the Red Cross expects at least 900,000 cases by the end of the year.“The situation has really evolved in a very dramatic way and I think that it’s nothing short of a catastrophe,” Faite told a news briefing in Geneva.Civil war in Yemen has killed more than 10,000 people since it began in March 2015. Control of the country is split between the Iran-aligned Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa. Opposed to the Houthis are a Saudi-led coalition.With the main port of Hodeidah damaged, the Red Cross brings medical aid, including insulin, into Yemen with occasional cargo planes to Sanaa. Other goods come by land convoys from Jordan and Oman and by ship from Jordan, Oman and Dubai.A ship from Karachi with 500 metric tonnes of rice is now due on Oct 7 in Hodeidah, the first ICRC shipment there since early February.Faite called on all sides to open Sanaa airport to commercial flights for essential aid supplies and to make progress toward allowing the Red Cross to visit prisoners of war.“I don’t think political settlement is coming soon and I‘m very worried that the extension of the conflict would lead to more problems,” Faite said.“This is why humanitarian aid, access of essential goods should be there,” he said. “There is a bottleneck”.Although the death rate for cholera victims has dropped to less than 0.3 percent, Faite said Yemen’s “health sector is really on its knees in Yemen ... the health staff is on its knees as well because they are not paid.”For the first time, the Red Cross is now providing health workers with food parcels, he said.“In terms of access to even water, electricity, there isn’t a power grid in the main cities in Yemen. Without the ICRC and other organisations fixing (pumping stations) there wouldn’t be any running water in Sanaa,” he said."
608,"MANCHESTER: Apologizing for losing her Conservative Party’s majority in a June election, Prime Minister Theresa May responded to her critics on Sunday by saying she had the right strategy to lead Britain and win a Brexit deal.May — who has faced calls from within her party to step down — wants to use the Conservatives’ annual conference in the northern English city of Manchester this week to try to reset her agenda, offering money to students and those people she once described as “just about managing” in Britain.In an interview with BBC television, she dismissed talk of rifts among top ministers, saying they were united on their program and more importantly Brexit.That came a day after foreign minister Boris Johnson — perhaps May’s biggest rival — set out four personal red lines in the complex talks with the EU.But with thousands of protesters just outside the conference centre gates demanding Britain stay in the European Union (EU), May has a long way to go to unite not only her governing party but also the country after last year’s divisive referendum vote.“We’ve listened to the message that came from that (June) election. But I’ve been very clear, I called the election, I led the campaign, I take my responsibility and I‘m sorry that some very good members of parliament lost their seats,” May said in an appeal to those party members still angry over the vote.“What I have is a cabinet that is united in the mission of this government… and agreed on the approach that we took in Florence,” May said about a speech she made in Italy last month to try to kick-start Brexit talks that had all but stalled.“Boris is absolutely behind the Florence speech and the line that we have taken.”Arriving at the conference, Johnson was quick to say he was loyal to the prime minister. But he has yet to comment further on his four red lines — which include a transition period of no longer than two years — that he set out on the eve of the conference in what his critics said was a clear move to pressure May.Minster after minister appealed for unity from a party deeply disillusioned by the June election, with several saying the only way to win back voters was to challenge the growing appeal of the main opposition Labour Party directly.“I think one of the problems we have at the moment and what kind of rankles with me a little bit is that we have got to stop talking about the party,” trade minister Liam Fox told an event.“The party needs to stop talking about the party and start talking more about the country.”Following a bullish Labour conference last week, May hopes to fire up thousands of Conservative party members who feel let down by a disastrous election campaign, when their leader was dubbed by critics “the Maybot” for her repetition of slogans.May is now dependent on a small Northern Irish party for a majority in parliament, and opinion polls indicate Labour is a growing threat, persuading rivals in the party not to try to topple her quite yet.On her 61st birthday, she unveiled new policies to extend a program to help people buy their own homes and to freeze student tuition fees to try to win back younger people, who have flocked to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.She offered Brexit supporters a promise that she would walk away if she could not get a good deal, saying the government was working on plans for a ‘no deal’; and tried to keep pro-EU campaigners onside by saying she wanted an agreement.Damian Green — May’s ally and effective deputy — said he was confident she could lead the Conservatives into the next election in 2022 and criticized those fuelling leadership speculation that hampers “a job not just for the party but more importantly for the government and the country”.But May has a long way to go to win over doubters.“If you run any organization… and something goes monumentally wrong, as did the election ... then the buck does have to stop with that individual,” Grant Shapps — former Conservative Party chairman — said.“The reality is, every serious person knows, of course, she can’t lead us into the next election.”"
609,"SAN JUAN: US President Donald Trump on Sunday strenuously defended US efforts to bring relief to storm-battered Puerto Rico, even as one island official said Trump was trying to gloss over ""things that are not going well"".A day after Trump launched a Twitter attack against San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz following her desperate pleas for more help, he tweeted that ""we have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico.""Trump said US military teams and the Federal Emergency Management Agency were doing ""amazing work"" and credited the island's governor and others with a ""fantastic job.""But two weeks after devastating Hurricane Maria left much of the island without electricity, fresh water or sufficient food, many Puerto Ricans seemed to have a far gloomier outlook.Hilda Lopez, in her 80s, broke into tears when approached as she left Mass at San Juan's Cathedral.""Never has our enchanted island been in the dark and with so much suffering,"" she said between sobs, a green shawl draped over her shoulders.""It pains me that the president of the United States has expressed himself the way he has in recent days. I don't know if it's because he doesn't appreciate the pain"" that Puerto Ricans are suffering.Trump, in one tweet Sunday, said that those who continued to criticize the relief effort were either ""Fake News or politically motivated ingrates.""Mayor Cruz, in an interview with CNN, shrugged off the criticism. She told CNN that millions were still in dire circumstances and that Trump seemed to be ""looking for an excuse for things that are not going well.""Trump's criticism has drawn sharp retorts even from within his Republican Party.""When people are in the middle of a disaster, you don't start trying to criticize them,"" Ohio Governor John Kasich, a presidential hopeful in 2016, said on CNN. ""You got to be bigger than the nonsense.""And Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016, told CNN: ""Speaking from his fancy golf club, playing golf with his billionaire friends, attacking the mayor of San Juan, who is struggling to bring electricity to the island, food to the island, water to the island, gas to the island, that is just — it is unspeakable.""And I don't know what world Trump is living in.""Trump spent Sunday morning at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, before travelling to another golf course in nearby Jersey City to present the trophy to the winner of the Presidents Cup tournament.The Trump administration sent several top officials onto Sunday talk shows with the message that the relief effort is going well, despite complaints that the federal effort in Puerto Rico has fallen short of the work done after hurricanes ravaged Texas, Florida and Louisiana.""The administration's done an extraordinary job of delivering goods and services to people,"" said White House economics adviser Gary Cohn, appearing on Fox News Sunday.

Only one-tenth of the island has cell service.The Pentagon said 59 of 69 hospitals surveyed were partly or fully operational. The Navy hospital ship Comfort is scheduled to arrive in San Juan on Wednesday.When Long was asked about Trump's suggestion that Puerto Ricans wanted ""everything to be done for them,"" he said, ""I believe the Puerto Ricans are pulling their weight.""But he suggested that Mayor Cruz might not be aware of all that FEMA is doing because she had visited the agency's joint field office in San Juan only once.Asked about that on ABC, Cruz said that after that visit ""we have been communicating ever since.""Trump is scheduled to visit the island on Tuesday. Would Cruz be willing to meet with him?""If he asks to meet with me,"" she said, ""of course I will meet with him.""Outside San Juan Cathedral on Sunday, 57-year-old retiree Aida Rosario said she, too, would welcome a Trump visit.""Let Trump come, let him see how things are here, let him experience what we are living,"" she said.""There are people who can hardly eat — or maybe once a day...""We are in difficult times."""
610,"Amitabh Bachchan and his now daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are among celebrities whose names appeared on Panama Papers. The latest reports suggest that the two recently submitted documents of their financial dealings with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the issue.According to a source, “The replies have been received. They could be soon summoned as part of the probe.”The documents have been submitted through their representative while the ED had asked that it is better if the actors appear and face the investigation themselves rather than sending their representatives.According to an official report, “In a phase-wise manner, concerned individuals and entities are being summoned and statements have been recorded. In the next phase, another set of names would be summoned. It could include film stars as well, whose names and addresses were found to be part of the leaked data of 2,10,000 offshore companies incorporated by Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.”The income tax department has launched 33 prosecutions so far that are linked to the names revealed in the Panama Papers. Bachchan and family have earlier responded to notices issued to them in connection to the issue in the past while Aishwarya Rai and Ajay Devgn too have been on the receiving end of such notices.— Originally published in The News "

614,"ANTANANARIVO: The World Health Organization said Sunday it was boosting its response to a plague outbreak in Madagascar that has killed 24 people, as the government banned public meetings to reduce infections.In a televised address Saturday, Prime Minister Olivier Mahafaly Solonandrasana said no public meetings or demonstrations would be allowed in the capital, Antananarivo, which has seen six deaths in recent days.""At airports and bus stations, measures will be taken for passengers to avoid panic and to control the disease,"" he added after an emergency meeting with the UN health agency.Madagascar has suffered plague outbreaks almost every year since 1980, often sparked by rats fleeing forest fires. The current outbreak was unusual as it had affected large urban areas, increasing the risk of transmission, the WHO warned.The outbreak is a mix of bubonic plague, which spreads by infected rats via flea bites, and pneumonic plague spread person-to-person.The highly infectious disease killed millions of people across the world in the past before being largely wiped out.""WHO is concerned that plague could spread further because it is already present in several cities and this is the start of the epidemic season,"" Charlotte Ndiaye, WHO representative in Madagascar, said in a statement Sunday. “Our teams are on the ground in Madagascar providing technical guidance.”The first death this year occurred on August 28 when a passenger died in a public taxi en route to a town on the east coast. Two others who came into contact with the passenger also died.Officials are trying to identify people who came into contact with a basketball coach from the Seychelles who died of plague in Antananarivo on Wednesday while visiting the island for a sports event.Plague can be cured with antibiotics but can be fatal within 24 hours if it affects the lungs.On Saturday, the health ministry said the death toll had risen to 24 from 19 on Thursday, with more than 100 infected.The recurrent outbreaks in Madagascar have been attributed to poor hygiene and insufficient health care.The government said one girl among the dead had apparently been involved in a ceremony retrieving the bodies of deceased family members, rewrapping their remains and dancing with the corpses.WHO has released $300,000 in emergency funds, as well as extra supplies of antibiotics and protective equipment.It appealed for $1.5 million to fund the emergency response. "
615,"OSLO: Norway has agreed to host former Israeli nuclear technician and whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu, his Norwegian wife has told local television.""We made a request for family reunification as that´s exactly the case here, for spouses and a family to be able to live together,"" Kristin Joachimsen told TV2 late Saturday.""So even if I know the affair is controversial in some circles, it´s the family values that won over,"" she said. But she said she did not know when her 62-year-old husband could join her in Norway.Karl Erik Sjoholt, an official with Norway´s immigration agency, confirmed the request had been approved.""The ministry sent us the request last week and we reviewed it in the usual manner. We approved the request for family reunification,"" he told TV2.Israel jailed Vanunu in 1986 for disclosing the inner workings of its Dimona nuclear plant to Britain´s Sunday Times newspaper.He spent more than 10 years of his sentence in solitary confinement.Upon his release in 2004, Vanunu was slapped with a series of restraining orders, forbidding him from travel, contact with foreigners or speaking to the media.He has twice been jailed for breaking those orders.The couple´s Norwegian lawyer, Arild Humlen, said the immigration agency´s decision had increased the likelihood of Vanunu leaving Israel to settle in Norway.""I hope it will resolve a blocked situation and that Israel will seize this opportunity,"" he told TV2.Vanunu converted from Judaism to Christianity shortly before being snatched by Mossad agents in Rome in 1986 and smuggled to Israel.On Sunday, a spokesman for Israel´s foreign ministry could not say if Vanunu had made a new request to travel to Norway.But he said restrictions on the whistleblower´s freedom of movement were ""due to the danger that he posed"" to the Jewish state.In a statement, the foreign ministry said: ""Israel will continue to review updates of the situation in order to determine appropriate restrictions in accordance with security dangers posed by Vanunu.""Israel is the Middle East´s sole if undeclared nuclear power, refusing to confirm or deny that it has such weapons.Israel has refused to sign the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty or to allow international surveillance of its Dimona plant in the Negev desert in southern Israel."
616,"MARSEILLE: A knifeman killed two women at the main train station in the French Mediterranean city of Marseille on Sunday before being shot dead by soldiers on patrol.One of the victims had her throat slit by the assailant, a man with a criminal record believed to be in his 30s.French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said about a dozen witnesses were being questioned.""This act could be terrorist in nature but at this time we cannot confirm that,"" he added.Soldiers serving in a special 7,000-strong force known as Sentinelle set up to guard vulnerable areas in terror-hit France responded to the stabbings and shot dead the attacker, whose identity remains unknown.""I was on the esplanade just in front of the station,"" Melanie Petit, an 18-year-old student, told AFP. ""I saw a man who seemed to be dressed all in black.""Heavily armed police sealed off and evacuated the ornate rail terminus in the bustling heart of France´s second-biggest city, stopping all train traffic on some of the country´s busiest lines.The latest deaths came with France still on high alert and under a state of emergency following a string of attacks in recent years by extremists linked to the Daesh group or Al-Qaeda.Since 2015, a total of 239 people have been killed in France.After the lunchtime attack, anti-terror prosecutors said they had opened an investigation into ""killings linked to a terrorist organisation"" and the ""attempted killing of a public official"".Travellers around the station described ""controlled panic"" as security forces evacuated passengers and looked for possible accomplices, while another witness said white sheets were placed over the bodies of the victims.""There were police everywhere,"" said Francois Jacquel, a retired traveller who was in a waiting room.The country has suffered several major terror attacks since 2015, including on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January of that year followed by an assault on Paris bars and the Bataclan concert hall by gunmen 10 months later.In Nice in July 2016, 86 people were killed when an extremist drove a truck into crowds after a fireworks display on Bastille Day.But there have also been numerous smaller attacks on police officers, soldiers or members of the public since then, sometimes carried out by people with severe psychological problems.Since November 2015, the country has been in a state of emergency which gives the government and security forces greater powers to combat extremists and launch anti-terror raids.New centrist President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to end the state of emergency with a new and controversial security law that will make many of the provisions of the emergency regime permanent.Despite criticism from rights groups that the law reduces judicial oversight over the actions of the police, the lower house of parliament is set to vote on a first draft of the legislation on Tuesday.French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe vowed: ""We will not lower our guard.""In August, a man driving a van killed one person and seriously injured another after ploughing into a bus stop in Marseille, raising fears of another terror incident.But doctors said later the man had severe mental problems and discounted any terror link. "

620,"MONTREAL: Canadian police arrested a man early Sunday suspected of stabbing an officer and injuring four pedestrians in a series of violent incidents being investigated as an ""act of terrorism.""The crime spree began Saturday evening outside a football stadium in the city of Edmonton and ended hours later with a high-speed chase in which the driver of a rented truck ploughed into pedestrians, police said.""Currently, we believe this is an individual who acted alone, although the investigation is in its early stages,"" Edmonton police chief Rod Knecht said.Based on the actions and the evidence at the scene, the incidents were being investigated as ""acts of terrorism,"" police said in a statement.At approximately, 8:15pm a man in a speeding white Chevy Malibu crashed through police barricades outside an Edmonton stadium where a Canadian Football League game was being played.The car struck a police officer standing in front of his patrol car, ""sending him flying 15-feet through the air.""""A male, believed to be 30 years of age, then jumped out of his vehicle and began viciously stabbing the officer with a knife, as a struggle ensued,"" the police statement said.The suspect then fled on foot and the police officer was rushed to a hospital.Just before midnight, police pulled over a rental U-Haul truck and noticed that the name on the driver´s license was similar to that of the white Malibu.The man in the truck then took off toward downtown Edmonton, according to the police account.""During the chase, the U-Haul truck deliberately attempted to hit pedestrians in crosswalks and alleys,"" it said.""Currently, it is believed four pedestrians were struck by the truck and transported to a hospital with multiple injuries,"" it said.The chase ended when the truck flipped over, and the driver was arrested.Police described him as a 30-year-old from Edmonton.Canada´s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concern and outrage Sunday over a ""terrorist attack"" in which five people were injured by a driver who ran over police and pedestrians in a violent rampage.""While the investigation continues, early reports indicate that this is another example of the hate that we must remain ever vigilant against,"" he said in a statement."
621,"CHARSADDA: A man reportedly choked his six-month-old daughter to death over her wailing. According to the police, the incident took place in Serai Kalay area of Charsadda where Syed Ahmed Shah held his daughter by her neck, irritated by the sound of her wailing. When the baby’s mother went to free the six-month-old’s neck from her father’s grip, he pushed her aside, said the police. The medical report also showed torture on the baby. However, the baby’s mother filed a case, getting the accused arrested. Although Shah has yet to explain his reason behind the brutal act, studies suggest the sound of a baby crying activates primitive parts of the brain that can trigger involved in fight-or-flight responses.Katie Young of University of Oxford used a very fast scanning technique, called magnetoencephalography, and found out an early burst of activity in the brain in response to the sound of a baby cry, which was followed by an intense reaction after about 100 milliseconds, reported The Guardian. The researchers also investigated how a baby's cry might subconsciously affect a person's behaviour. The parts that affect the person’s behaviour are among the brain's most primitive ones and are important in controlling behaviours such as the fight-or-flight response and other responses that keep people alive in dangerous situations."
622,"GENEVA: The fight against the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed at least 722 people over the past five years, is honing in on its target: camels.MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a member of a virus family ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, appears to have emerged in humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012 but has now been traced back in camels to at least 1983.Almost all the outbreaks so far originated in the Arabian Gulf, but MERS-CoV could infect humans wherever there are one-humped dromedary camels - two-humped Bactrians are not affected.That means people across a swathe of Africa, the Middle East, Pakistan and South Asia are potentially at risk. So the hunt is on for vaccinations - both for humans, and camels.“The virus is in camels everywhere. The virus is in Qatar, it’s in the United Arab Emirates, it’s wherever we look,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, a disease outbreak expert at the World Health Organization (WHO), where 130 experts gathered last week to collaborate for the first time on tackling the disease.“I know so much more about camels than I ever thought I would,” she said.People have probably caught MERS in Africa but the absence of outbreaks recorded there may be due to poor disease surveillance, less contact with camels, or lower rates of underlying conditions like obesity and heart problems that make MERS more severe.Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticized for not being transparent about MERS, but Van Kerkhove said that had totally changed. It is now testing 70,000 human samples a year and generating a vast amount of research.MERS is hard to spot, and far more deadly than other acute respiratory infections, killing one in three sufferers.It has a habit of infiltrating Saudi hospitals via patients visiting for regular dialysis or cardiac appointments, causing outbreaks that have killed patients and health workers alike.Hospitals are raising their game.“One hospital even has a drive-thru. Literally a drive-thru in their emergency department,” said Van Kerkhove, explaining how patients are vetted before being allowed in.“You drive up in the car to the person in the booth and they ask you three questions. It takes less than 13 seconds.”A dozen human vaccines are in development, with vaccine coalition CEPI expected to announce soon which it will fund.But the key to stopping human deaths is controlling MERS in camels. Two camel vaccines have been developed, but only one, developed by the Jenner Institute, is in field trials.The other, developed at the Erasmus Medical Centre, is still seeking funding. The WHO MERS program is also under-funded, Van Kerkhove said.At last week’s meeting, hosted by the WHO, animal health body OIE and the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, Saudi and Qatari experts were “happy to talk to each other” despite their governments’ diplomatic friction, she said.Collaboration is vital, because camels must be diagnosed, quarantined and vaccinated as they enter the Gulf from the Horn of Africa. The virus must be tracked like bird flu is in birds, Van Kerkhove said.But there is a long road ahead.“I’ve never seen a really good map showing where camels move,” she said."
623,"NAPLES: In the hinterlands of Naples a revolution is afoot: locals tired of drug lords are taking the fight to the mafia and their weapon of choice is the humble book.Tucked away between squats and roadside traders of broken toys rises the first bookshop in nearly 50 years.Now one of the poorest areas in southern Italy is attempting to cast off the stereotype of Kalashnikov-wielding teens and get its young off the streets by flooding the turf with theatre, cinema and literature associations. The tower blocks, riddled with asbestos and divided by rubbish-strewn no-man’s lands, were thrown up in the 1970s.""There has never been a bookshop here. We had to travel 10 kilometres to buy a book,"" Rosario Esposito La Rossa, whose shop ""Scugnizzeria"" opened a week ago, told AFP.The idea for the small store, which also has a room for theatre and study groups, followed the death of La Rossa’s disabled relative Antonio, caught in the crossfire of a 2004 shoot-out and labelled a trafficker by the state.""He was hit by two bullets as he played table football, but police said he had links to the Cali cocaine cartel in Colombia,” he said. “We fought for 10 years to clear his name and it became a cultural battle for our neighbourhood.”When La Rossa inherited the Marotta&Cafiero publishing house in 2010 he moved it to Scampia to continue the fight.""There were those who said we would close within a few weeks because no one reads in Scampia, it has the highest illiteracy rate in southern Italy. Seven years on and we have published 88 books,"" he said.The 29-year-old is just the tip of an iceberg of change slowly edging its way across the northern suburb of Naples.The government has pledged to demolish three of the four remaining Sails of Scampia, notorious tower blocks shaped like sails where staircases boast metal gates installed by traffickers to slow down police during raids.Naples’ Federico II university, one of the world´s oldest, is set to open a new faculty in the area – though the project is running three years behind schedule – and tentative plans are also under way to refurbish the metro.But La Rossa says the most important role is played by the 120 or so associations that step in where the state fails.Daniele Sanzone co-founded Scampia Trip Tour to challenge the area’s brutal image in the press and popular culture and show off its positive side.""The Camorra exists, the drugs exist, we would be mad to deny it,” he said. “But there is so much more, small organisations which become garrisons of legality, from football clubs to Italy’s first Italian-Roma restaurant.”The tour has been a hit so far with everyone from US tourists to Italians normally too scared to enter Scampia.""Ten years ago it was known as the biggest open-air drug market in Europe, but things have changed a lot since then, largely due to a blood feud in 2006 which left hundreds dead and sparked a police crackdown,” he said. ""Before there was drug trafficking every 50 metres. Today we can walk in the streets without fear.”Sanzone admits the associations can only do so much for the 80,000 to 100,000 inhabitants here, where many families live off the radar and only around 37% of adults of working age have jobs.""Being born here means having few options,"" he said.But he and the other activists in Scampia, where half the population is under 25 years old, are sure change is coming.""I am convinced that in 10 years’ time this place will be transformed,"" La Rossa said. ""People will come here to study how it shifted from being Camorra land to the land of children."" "

According to the police, 7,000 personnel, as well as paramilitary forces, were deployed for the event.In Lahore, the Ashura procession began with the traditional majlis at Nisar Haveli. Then it proceeded through narrow alleyways of the 'old city' and concluded in the evening upon reaching Karbala Gamay Shah.In Peshawar and Quetta, the processions commenced from Imambargah Agha Syed Ali Shah Rizvi and from Rehmantullah Chowk on Alamdar Road, respectively, and peacefully concluded upon reaching their destinations.Stringent security measures were in place across the country to ensure safety of mourners.In Karachi, the main procession ended at Hussainiya Irania ImambargahCellular and internet services remained suspended in Karachi, Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Khairpur, Haripur, DI Khan and Lakki Marwat, among other areas.A ban on motorcycle pillion riding was also in place in Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta, whereas the metro bus in Islamabad and Rawalpindi too remained non-operational on Sunday.With regard to further security and safety inside of the procession, followers and mourners will be required to enter via walk-through gates, installed with metal detectors.In their messages, President Mamnoon Hussain and Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi have urged the nation to promote great characteristics of sacrifice, unity and discipline.In his message, the president said the country can get rid of all political and social issues like extremism by deciding the line of action keeping in view Imam Hussain's (RA) sacrifice.He said while commemorating the sacrifices of Imam Hussain (RA) and his family members, we should keep in view his objectives and strategies, which provide a solution to the issues of humanity, particularly those confronting us.And in his message, the premier said keeping in view the internal and external threats confronting the country we should shun our religious, sectarian and ethnic biases.He said the sacrifices of the martyrs have proved that the truth is destined to live forever while the fate of the falsity is elimination."
625,"LOS ANGELES: Disgraced American football star O.J. Simpson, whose racially charged 1995 murder trial riveted the nation, was released from jail on parole early Sunday after nine years behind bars for armed robbery.Simpson, 70, left the Lovelock Correctional Center in the western state of Nevada just after midnight local time, prison spokesperson Brooke Keast said. ""I don´t know where he was headed,"" Keast told AFP.Simpson was granted parole at a hearing in July and his earliest release date was set for October 1, but he had widely been expected to be freed no earlier than Monday.Instead, he was set free at eight minutes past midnight (0708 GMT Sunday) ""to ensure public safety and avoid a possible incident,"" Keast said.Simpson plans to relocate to Florida following his release from the medium-security prison where he has been serving his sentence, Malcolm LaVergne, his lawyer, said.But news of his intended move was not warmly received in Florida.According to The Tampa Bay Times, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi sent word that Florida objects to Simpson serving parole there.""Our state should not become a country club for this convicted criminal,"" she said.Simpson was famously found not guilty in 1995 of the grisly murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and a male friend, Ron Goldman, in a case that transfixed the country and became known as the ""Trial of the Century.""But the former National Football League running back and actor was sent to prison in 2008 for his role in an armed robbery the previous year of two sports memorabilia dealers at a Las Vegas resort.Simpson claimed at his trial that he was just seeking to recover personal items from the dealers, an explanation that satisfied his parole board.At his parole hearing in July Simpson initially did not express any remorse for his actions but eventually offered that he was ""sorry that things turned out the way they did.""LaVergne told KTNV-TV that Simpson planned to relocate to Florida, play golf and be around his friends and family.""He´s had perfect performance as a prisoner,"" LaVergne said. ""I anticipate he´s going to have perfect performance as a parolee.""Simpson was convicted in October 2008 of armed robbery, assault, kidnapping and other offences after he and five associates — two of whom were armed — ambushed the two sports memorabilia dealers in a casino hotel room.He was sentenced to a minimum of nine years in prison and a maximum of 33 years.Orenthal James ""O.J."" Simpson shot to fame in the 1970s with the NFL´s Buffalo Bills after winning the prestigious Heisman Trophy — the award for the best player in American collegiate football — as a running back at the University of Southern California.He retired from football in 1979 after setting numerous rushing records and went on to become an advertising pitchman and a Hollywood actor (""The Towering Inferno,"" ""The Naked Gun"").In June 1994, Simpson´s 35-year-old ex-wife and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home.Simpson was arrested after a low-speed car chase through Los Angeles that was broadcast live by television stations and watched by millions.He was acquitted in October 1995 after a nine-month trial, a verdict that was greeted with disbelief by many Americans.Public views on the African-American athlete´s guilt or innocence divided sharply along racial lines.Simpson was subsequently found liable for the deaths in a 1997 civil suit and was ordered to pay damages totalling $33.5 million to the families of the victims.It´s a sum the family of Ron Goldman are still trying to recover — and their attorney says he is ready for ""round two,"" CNN reports.""The good news for me is he´s getting out.

626,"MANCHESTER: Boeing needs to get around the table with Bombardier to thrash out a solution to its trade dispute that has put thousands of jobs at risk in Northern Ireland, the British minister for the region said on Sunday.James Brokenshire told his Conservative Party’s annual conference that Boeing’s role in getting the US government to slap a 220 percent tariff on Bombardier’s CSeries jet was “unjustified and unwarranted”.The tariff, which will take effect only if the US International Trade Commission backs Boeing in a final decision expected in 2018, has dealt a major blow to the Canadian company’s flagship project.It has also cast a huge shadow over Northern Ireland, where Bombardier is by far the most important manufacturer and a pillar of Belfast’s economy, employing 4,200 people and supporting thousands more in the supply chain.“I say to Boeing this case is unjustified and unwarranted. This action is not what is expected of a long-term partner to the UK. They need to get round the table and secure a negotiated outcome to this dispute quickly.”Northern Ireland is the poorest of the United Kingdom’s four parts and is mired in political difficulties after emerging from decades of armed sectarian conflict.Boeing, the world’s largest aerospace company, says it is upholding trade rules and not trying to damage the CSeries. It accuses Canada and Britain of unfairly subsidizing Bombardier and says Bombardier has illegally dumped its products in the US single-aisle airplane market out of desperation.“The support that the UK provided to the Bombardier operation in Belfast was and remains compliant with international requirements,” Brokenshire said.The ruling is a political headache for Britain’s minority Conservative government, which relies on support from a Northern Irish party to stay in power.It also undermines the government’s assurances to Britons that free trade and London’s close ties with Washington will be pillars of Britain’s prosperity and global influence after it leaves the European Union in 2019."

628,"KOROLYOV: When the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite 60 years ago, it marked both the beginning of space exploration and the start of a race between Moscow and Washington.Sputnik, the tiny silver sphere with four spider leg-like antennae, showed off Soviet technological prowess.But German scientists -- who had worked on Adolf Hitler´s rocket projects and had been brought to the USSR after the war -- were the ones who stood at the forefront of space achievement.The founder of the Soviet space programme, Sergei Korolyov, worked with German scientists and fragments of the German FAU rocket to develop a new military missile, said Nikolai Shiganov, one of the scientists behind Soviet rocket R-7 which put Sputnik into orbit.""The Korolyov bureau had to create an intercontinental rocket capable of carrying a hydrogen bomb to any point on the planet,"" Shiganov, now aged 97, told AFP in an interview.As he worked for the military, Korolyov -- who spent six years in the Gulag -- dreamt of space conquest. But time was running out: one of the principal German engineers, Wernher von Braun, was already working for the Americans.After three years of work and three rocket accidents, the fourth R-7 with a dummy warhead successfully hit its target in Kamchatka, in the Far East, in August 1957. The test was hailed as successful although the rocket head disintegrated in flight.Creating a new rocket head would take six months, much too long as the Soviets wanted to pre-empt the launch of a US satellite in 1958. So Korolyov suggested creating a simple satellite made of two hemispheres containing sensors, a radio and a battery pack.In just two months, the apparatus measuring 58 centimetres (22 inches) in diameter and weighing 83.6 kilogrammes (184.3 pounds) was ready, remembered Shiganov, whose lab created the aluminium alloy and came up with a new welding technique used to make the Sputnik and the R-7.Though the satellite captured imaginations, with radio amateurs tuning in around the world to hear its simple calls, Sputnik was secondary to its inventors, Shiganov said.""The most important thing was that it proved the effectiveness of the R-7 rocket.""The secrecy around the project meant Shiganov didn´t learn of the actual launch until he heard on the radio that the first Earth satellite was put in orbit on October 4, 1957, from a testing range in Kazakhstan, the future Baikonur cosmodrome.On a sunny October Sunday, Shiganov was able to see the glint of Sputnik with his naked eye.""It was a tiny dot which shone in the sun because of its glossy surface,"" he said.Sputnik was in orbit for 92 days, making 1,440 circles around Earth, before losing speed and burning up in the atmosphere. Several replicas are now on show in museums.Shiganov´s colleague Eduard Bolotov, 84, actually saw Sputnik as a young rocket trajectory engineer of 24, even gaining access to the depot where the rocket stood during final preparations.The minuscule satellite sat atop the rocket and Bolotov, with other young specialists, patted the rocket´s side and signed his name on the inside of the nozzle.""I watched the actual launch through a gap from my post,"" Bolotov said.Although workers were summoned to the launchpad with secret letters, crowds of people also turned up, he said. ""Their relatives had told them about the launch.""""Only at 3 am we found out that Sputnik was in orbit, and radios all over the world started to register its beeps.""""Then we went back to our dorms and drank pure alcohol for the victory of our rocket,"" he said. "
629,"LAHORE: A woman in Sheikhupura killed her son reportedly over a fake faith healer’s suggestion.According to the police, the woman, a resident of Ferozewala, thrashed to death her 22-year-old son Zeeshan after the faith healer told her to do so if she wanted “to stay alive”.The accused was later arrested. Initially, police said, the woman told them thieves killed Zeeshan after looting him. She then said supernatural beings killed her son, police added. However, she eventually confessed to the crime, telling the police she killed her son as a faith healer had asked her to do so.Although the woman was arrested, the fake faith healer, Naveed, remained at large till this report was filed.Fatal actions and self-harm over guidance from fake faith healers is a common occurrence across Punjab where multiple such incidents have taken place.In February, a woman was killed during ‘exorcism’ by two fake faith healers, whom she was taken to by her husband.Faith-healer had suggested victim to slit his own throat to set free an 'invisible evil spirit' that was strangling himSoraiya Begum, a resident of Sajjadabad in Dera Ghazi Khan had begun talking to herself. Her husband did not suspect her condition to be psychological and instead suspected his wife to have been possessed by Djinns. To drive the ‘evil’ out he took her to two ‘faith healers’ who beat her, burned her and killed her.In May of 2016, a man in Chiniot slit his throat over advice from a self-claimed ‘spiritual healer’.  "
630,"Former Captain Shahid Afridi has decided to join Karachi Kings in the next edition of Pakistan Super League. Formerly part of the Peshawar Zalmi team, the cricketer has decided to return to Karachi.Afridi has been praised in all circles for the move, including Karachiites who believe they had a weak team in both editions of PSL so far.Shahid Afridi is the biggest name in Pakistan cricket and we are extremely pleased to have him on board, says Kings ownerI was recently asked by my cousin about Shahid Afridi’s debut. The chap was born somewhere when Afridi was hitting sixes around the world and is clueless as to what life was back then. Unlike present times, missing a match back then was a big deal when YouTube highlights weren’t available minutes after the match ended.The question took me decades back in time. It seemed like yesterday, when on September 23, 1996, Pakistan beat India in the last match of the inaugural Sahara Cup by 52 runs, taking the series 3-2. The tormentor-in-chief, leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed took five wickets, but couldn’t accompany the team to Kenya due to an injury. Wasim Akram was called home from Canada to look after his sick father, so Saeed Anwar was given the task to lead the team. A 16-year-old leg-spinner was called to replace Mushtaq from the neighbouring Caribbean Islands, where he was busy with the Pakistan Under-19. Even he was not aware of what lay ahead for him in the four-nation tournament.Cricket was changing in 1996. Sri Lanka had just won the World Cup, due to the explosive batting of Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana. Jayasuriya plundered Pakistan’s experienced bowling attack to score the fastest hundred in 48 balls and a ‘50 in 18’, during a tournament in Singapore, a month after the World Cup.Pakistan needed a pinch-hitter and the collective prayers of the team, management, and the nation were answered in the very next outing between the two countries.It was 21 years back when Sahibzada Mohammad Shahid Khan Afridi made his debut against Kenya. He was not required to bat, remained wicket-less, but took a catch in that match. Waqar Younis, after witnessing him bat in the nets, asked Saeed Anwar to try him at the top of the order. Everybody knows that he scored a century on 37 balls, smashing 11 sixes, but only a few remember that the innings was not televised in Pakistan.The score of 371, the second-highest total ever scored in a one-day international, was nothing short of a miracle to achieve against the then World Champions.The match, which virtually had no importance, became the talk of the town. In the pre-internet days, I started calculating the runs, before searching for ‘Afridi’. If you subtract 102 from 371, it gives you 269.At least one other batsman must have scored a hundred, but who could that be? Saeed Anwar and Ramiz Raja were ‘prime suspects’ as both had scored hundreds last year, and were with the team. Saeed had eight hundreds as compared to Ramiz’s nine. It was not until the next morning that we came to know that it was Saeed Anwar who did it, with a six and 13 fours. The score-card, on the extreme column of the newspaper, was the only information of the match available.Sri Lanka would have qualified for the final, had it scored 290. Saqlain Mushtaq and Waqar Younis had already taken four wickets in the innings and the match came to a very tight situation. 11 runs were required from the last four deliveries, with the last pair on the crease.Chaminda Vaas was facing Waqar Younis, who was reliable in such situations. Vaas hit Waqar for a six and a four but was bowled with one ball remaining, when the score was 289.In days of satellite, the match was surprisingly not shown on any sports channel. My eyes turned to Rainbow Centre, the hub for video cassettes of every type, in downtown Saddar market of Karachi and a search started for the ‘record-shattering’ match. On my first trip to the now defunct Pakistan Sports, I was told that print would be available in a week’s time. Until then, Afridi was back in Karachi, and magazines like ‘Akhbar-e-Watan’, ‘The Cricketer’, ‘Cricketer Urdu,’ and ‘Cricket Herald’ had him on their covers. The 16-year-old became the most sought-after commodity for the press.In his fifth ODI, he took 37 deliveries, again, to score 66 runs against Zimbabwe in Lahore. This innings had eight fours and four sixes and yes, it was witnessed by many on the television. By then, we had acquired the VHS recording of the ‘fastest century’. The cassette became a hot cake in the neighbourhood. The sixes were huge, the boy was cute, and the innings was short, it seemed like one was watching the highlights. Afridi’s unconventional hits were being discussed everywhere. Every gathering began with, ‘Yaar, tu nay Afridi wali innings dekhi?’ (friend, have you watched the Afridi-innings yet?). Every slogger had at least one six that they claimed matched Afridi’s and every spinner had a quicker one to dismiss settled batsmen.Afridi soon became a necessity for the team and ‘Lala’ for the nation. He was the ‘Player of the tournament’when Pakistan won the tri-nation series in Australia in January 1997. He was a leg-spinner who could turn the tables with his spin, his bat could blast through any attack on his day and he remained a panther in the outfield. He was a loose cannon throughout his career that no one could control.Yet with age, he got the experience required and the recent performances in the PSL are proof of that. He played an important role in Peshawar Zalmi's victory in PSL earlier this year. Let’s hope his addition makes a ‘boom boom’ difference to Karachi."
631,"With many carrots and some sticks, ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia seeks to tackle entrenched male attitudes towards women drivers before millions take the wheel, many for the first time, next June.For decades, hardliners cited austere Islamic interpretations to justify the ban on women, with some maintaining that they lacked the intelligence to drive and allowing them to do so would promote promiscuity.The ban finally ended last week, but many women fear they are still easy prey for conservatives in a nation where male ""guardians"" have arbitrary authority to take decisions on their behalf.""You can revoke the ban, but you cannot force men to allow their sisters and wives to drive,"" said a Saudi man with a private taxi company in Riyadh, declining to be named.""As head of my family, I make the decisions — not the women,"" he told AFP, expressing an aversion to his wife driving as that would mean more contact with unrelated men.Such views are hardly an anomaly in the gender-segregated kingdom, despite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stunning reform push that has sought to liberalise the kingdom and add more women to the workforce.""Expect more accidents"" because of women drivers, remarked one Saudi, echoing an avalanche of sexist comments on Twitter.Saudi authorities last week arrested a man who threatened a violent backlash against any female driver whose car breaks down.""I swear to God, I will burn her and her car,"" the man, wearing a traditional white robe, said in an online video.Such attitudes have prompted fears among some women that they will struggle to get licences or could be deliberately failed in driving tests.The government has preemptively addressed such concerns, with the interior ministry pledging to enforce the law by any means necessary.Riyadh is already moving to bring female driving instructors from abroad and establish driving schools exclusively for women.Authorities are also moving to criminalise sexual harassment with a new law, with flogging and jail terms as possible penalties.The Saudi media is also taking on the conservative opposition — with a dash of humour.""Driving has always been a minefield in the battle of the sexes... Sorry fellas but women are the better drivers,"" declared a recent graphic published in the English-language daily Arab News, citing research that male drivers are involved in more accidents.Newspaper editorials have argued that if women were allowed to ride camels in the time of the Prophet Mohammed then they should be allowed to drive ""modern-day camels"" — cars.Others have highlighted the economic benefits of the reform; Saudi families would no longer need foreign chauffeurs, often a major source of financial strain.Sabq online newspaper published a cartoon comparing the merits of two drivers: a scraggily dressed foreign man and a veiled Saudi woman.""Man: Salary. Housing. Bad Tempered. Knows your deepest secrets. Ruins your car,"" it said.""Woman: Love. Care. Consideration. Commitment.""But authorities are careful not to antagonise the sensitivities of hardline clerics.The Council of Senior Scholars, the kingdom's highest religious body that is close to the royal family, announced the majority of its members found that lifting the ban was ""permissible"".Experts say their approval -- after decades of opposition -- symbolises the government's tightening grip on the religious establishment that has long dominated Saudi politics.""It's unlikely that the scholars who consistently maintained that driving would damage ovaries, deprive (women) of their virginity and integrity had a sudden epiphany that their decades-old beliefs were wrong,"" said James Dorsey from Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.When the ban was lifted, several women's rights activists who long fought it alleged that authorities warned them not to make any public comments — seemingly not to highlight that activism can lead to reform.The government denies the claim.Ali Shihabi, from the Washington-based think tank Arab Foundation, said on Twitter that the government did not want activists to ""further provoke the conservatives who were already provoked by (the) driving decision"".The decision was led by Prince Mohammed, who styles himself as a reformer who will set the country on the road to modernity and civil liberty.But some experts have called the decision pure tokenism until the kingdom dismantles its rigid guardianship system.""Women still face a number of other hurdles,"" said research firm Capital Economics.""It may take many years for Saudi society to fully accept a greater role for women.""A Saudi executive at a multinational company in Riyadh said the main obstacle remains a prevailing ""village mentality"", although some patriarchs prefer having women drive themselves than be chauffeured around by unrelated men.""Women drivers will become a new normal and then people will say: 'How come we didn't allow this to happen sooner?'"""

Global warming reduces crop yields, threatening global food security and push millions into poverty.labour force. Global warming reduces crop yields, threatening global food security and push millions into poverty.Speaking to Geo News, Abrar elaborated: “My work requires crossing disciplinary boundaries from natural science (understanding climate change), social science (how people are impacted and how they react) to management science (how responses are planned and organised). The research is close to my heart and touches on the bigger reality of how we can live in and adapt to an unpredictable and changing world with an ever-increasing population”The PHD has already been translated into several high-level journal publications, working papers and blogs.The award committee praised his research noting: ""It was extremely impressed with the novelty of the dissertation, the setting and detailed data and analyses, as well as the important practical implications of the work.”Abrar said: “I am delighted to receive this award as a Pakistani and the recognition of my work in developing pragmatic solutions for tackling the wicked challenge of climate change in resource constraint countries. I look forward to continuing researching this important work in my home country of Pakistan, building on my strong association with Oxford University.”Abrar has an interesting and diverse career. He grew up and studied in Lahore, trained as a chartered accountant. He went on to lead one of the oldest Pakistani accountancy firms, set up by his grandfather who was the first member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan.Abrar’s passion for the environment drove him to get a doctorate in Environmental Change and Management, an MBA, and an MSc in Environmental Management from the University of Oxford.He told Geo News his inspiration for studying climate change came from the 2010 floods in Pakistan.“Pakistan experienced its worst ever natural disaster in 2010. One-fifth of the country was under flood-waters, displacing millions of people and causing damage at scale of billions of US dollars. Despite promises for better prevention and coping measures by the government, civil society, and the global community, there was little evidence of actions to create capacity for local populations to deal with environmental shocks and adapt to longer-term environmental change.""""As an accountant I understood numbers but not the science behind climate change and extreme events. I wanted to learn what causes climate change and why our response was so lackluster, despite Pakistan consistently ranked as one of the most climate-vulnerable places in the world.”“I took a leap of faith, stepped out of my comfortable professional life, enrolled myself in Oxford. I have never looked back”He added: “The Pakistani floods were an eye-opener to the size and complexity of the climate change challenge in Pakistan and developing countries in general, and the substantial gap in the means for effective responses.""""My research showed that effective responses requires combined and sustained efforts of many disparate actors, from governments offering strong policy frameworks, experts creating evidence-based knowledge on local threats to treasury and development partners offering complementary assets and resources. The post-flooding analysis in Pakistan highlighted that recognising the challenge and setting policy is not enough. If efforts are fragmented and uncoordinated, responses are unlikely to be effective, leading to recurring disasters.”Abrar divides his time between Pakistan and Oxford, focusing on identifying practical and implementable solutions for climate change in Pakistan."

635,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has railed against a deal to curb Iran´s nuclear program, but officials say that far from scrapping it, he is considering kicking the decision to Congress.Ahead of an October 15 deadline, several officials familiar with White House deliberations told AFP Trump has made it clear he does not want to certify Iran´s compliance with the accord.The 2015-era Obama agreement offered Tehran relief from punitive economic sanctions, in return for limits to uranium enrichment and intrusive inspections.Every 90 days Trump must decide whether Iran is living up to its end of the bargain, something that has already caused him political pain on two occasions.The Trump administration has publicly accused Iran of violating the ""spirit"" of the accord — known as the JCPOA — although some officials privately admit there is a thin line between testing the limits and a material breach.Trump's top military advisor, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Joseph Dunford, has told Congress the briefings he has received ""indicate that Iran is adhering to its JCPOA obligations.""But Republicans are under domestic political pressure to fulfil campaign and donor promises to scrap the accord.Trump has called the deal an ""embarrassment to the United States"" and had urged allies and fellow signatories in London, Paris and Berlin to renegotiate it, something they are unwilling to do.But now a middle path is being explored, which would make Trump´s opposition clear, but stop short of scrapping the deal outright and perhaps clear the 90-day-review off his desk.Under the plan, Trump could find Iran in breach or - less provocatively - refuse to certify Tehran's compliance, giving Congress 60 days to decide whether to impose sanctions.The issue has prompted fierce debate inside the administration, and with this mercurial president, anything is still possible between now and the deadline.But ""it seems like he was leaning that way,"" said one official, echoing the accounts of others who refused to speak on the record, because of the sensitivity of the subject.Hawks are urging confrontation with Iran, while others warn of inflaming the Middle East and seriously damaging ties with European allies who consider the agreement in their vital national interest.Some aides are also warning against escalating tensions at a time when an analogous nuclear stand-off with North Korea worsens.The debate appeared to spill out into the open on Tuesday when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis contradicted Trump´s claim that the deal ""poses a direct national-security threat.""Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""at this point in time, absent indication to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with.""Asked whether he believed the Iran deal was in the national interest, Mattis replied: ""Yes, senator, I do.""In kicking the ball to Congress, Trump could still open the door to rupturing the deal.Lawmakers could decide to impose sanctions that, if implemented, would shatter the terms of the international agreement and leave the United States in breach.In July, four influential Republican Senators — Tom Cotton, David Perdue, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio — sent a letter to the administration claiming Iran had broken the accord on four counts.Senator Cotton drove home his argument in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday night, saying the ""sensible course"" was ""to decline to certify the deal and begin the work of strengthening it and counteracting Iranian aggression, with the threat of sanctions and military action if necessary.""But behind closed doors, the proposal is being greeted coolly by some Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have an already testy relationship with the president.A Congressional source said it was ""too early to say"" whether there would be enough support to pass sanctions.Much depends on how Trump frames their decision -- if he demands Congress do their job and sanction a ""nefarious"" Iran, then the pressure will grow.""I can absolutely see why the White House wants to kick it to Congress: the president gets the advantage of not certifying, but Congress has to take responsibility for what that means,"" said Kori Schake, formerly of the White House National Security Council and now the Hoover Institution.""It seems to be a questionable strategy for the White House to set in motion, where the president gets to be reckless but banks on Congress to act heroically and prevent disaster.""Doing so, she added, requires ""an awful lot of trust that the president won´t turn around and campaign against them for it.""The White House hopes to use the threat of sanctions to gather support for a harder international line on Iran.It would like to see curbs on Tehran´s ballistic missile program, an end to its support for militias across the Middle East and a revision of ""sunset clauses"" that would permanently end sanctions without a permanent end to the nuclear program.They are issues that allies believe should be addressed separately or in a successor agreement. There is also growing concern that if the deal survives, the same issue does not come every 90 days. "

640,"KARACHI Dubai-based private equity firm Abraaj Group said on Wednesday it made an investment in Pakistan’s top cinema operator, Cinepax, to drive expansion over the next four years.Abraaj will help Cinepax in developing 80 new screens across multiple locations, the private equity firm said in a statement.Cinepax will also develop other entertainment-related ventures, the statement said but did not reveal the value of the investment.Cinepax, which launched its first multiplex in 2007, has since established itself as the market leader in the country, boasting 29 screens in 12 locations.Pakistan’s current low ratio of cinema screens of 0.5 per million people and the possibility of revitalising the local film industry presents a compelling investment opportunity, Abraaj said.The investment will help build confidence among international investors about the Pakistan film industry, Nadeem Mandviwalla, head of a private Pakistani film distribution company and owner of multiple cinema screens told Reuters.Cinepax marks Abraaj’s ninth investment in Pakistan spanning a number of sectors including healthcare, power distribution, renewable energy, and industrials.Abraaj, which bought a majority stake in 2009 in power utility K-Electric, agreed in October 2016 to divest the 66.4 per cent shareholding to the Shanghai Electric Power Co Ltd for $1.77 billion."

643,"BRASILIA: The craze for tourists taking selfies alongside wild animals then posting on Instagram is fueling cruel treatment of iconic species in the Amazon, activists warn.The charity World Animal Protection said in a report that Instagram has seen a 292 percent increase in wildlife selfies since 2014 around the world. Of these, more than 40 percent involved humans ""hugging or inappropriately interacting with a wild animal.""World Animal Protection said in the report released Tuesday that the animals are captured and often battered to make them perform for tourism businesses.""Behind the scenes, these animals are often beaten into submission, taken from their mothers as babies and secretly kept in filthy, cramped conditions or repeatedly baited with food that can have a long-term negative impact on their biology and behaviour,"" the group said.""All too often, to the unsuspecting tourist, the cruelty that makes these animals submissive and available is entirely invisible.""The practice is rife in the Amazon region, with 61 percent of the species involved listed as needing international protection by the worldwide Convention on the Trade of Endangered Species, or CITES, according to the charity.In the Brazilian Amazon city of Manaus, for example, 18 tour companies said they offered opportunities on 94 percent of trips to ""hold and touch wild animals as photo props."" The most common selfie animal there is the pink river dolphin, then three-toed sloths, caimans, green anacondas and squirrel monkeys.""There is good reason to believe that most sloths being used for tourist selfies don´t survive even six months of this treatment,"" the report said.It listed examples of animals being kept in dire conditions for the selfie trade, including a manatee held in a small tank in front of a hotel and a giant anteater ""manhandled and beaten"" by its owner.Roberto Cabral, a coordinator for enforcement at the Brazilian environmental institute Ibama, told AFP that keeping animals for tourist selfies is illegal.In comparison to the scale of illegal trafficking of animals, the problem is ""minimal,"" he said.However, he also pleaded with visitors not to support the trend.""The irony is that the tourist who usually takes photos with an animal is the same tourist who likes animals but is now contributing to that animal´s distress,"" he said."

645,"The chief of the Ansarul Shariah Pakistan (ASP) was in contact with members of a proscribed group which was involved in a major terrorist attack in the country, confirmed a security official on Wednesday.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed that the attack was carried out in Karachi during 2014.During the attack, three militants were killed and later a number of their associates were apprehended by law enforcement authorities.Security officials confirmed that the ASP chief was in contact with other banned outfits after Abdullah Hashmi’s laptop was examined by forensic specialists. Law enforcement agencies are now re-investigating the Karachi attack.“During the investigation, it was unearthed that the death squad which attacked police officials in Karachi comprised of four members including Danish Rasheed, Sarosh Siddiqui, Muzammil Ali Junaidi and Hassan Nazeer”, revealed an officer who is part of the ongoing investigation of ASP.""Two of them were assigned to shoot, one was tasked with making a video of the attack and the last one was responsible for providing backup to them”.The source has also claimed that the real name of Dr. Abdullah Hashmi is Sheharyaruddin Warsi; he was responsible for the selection of targets but never participated in any assault.The official also claimed that as members of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) Sarosh Siddiqui, Sheharyaruddin Warsi, Muzammil Ali Junaidi and Osama went to Afghanistan in 2015 to receive militant training in the Baramcha area. They also joined Al-Qaeda there.Sarosh received serious injuries after his return to Karachi, as reportedly the close-knit group members had a clash with JeM activists in the Orangi Town area of the metropolis.Meanwhile, forensic examination of the laptops recovered from the house of Sarosh Siddiqui suggests that he developed a software (AM) to change IP addresses and to tamper with a phone's IMEI – International Mobile Equipment Identity.Officials believe that the upper portion of Siddiqui's house was serving as the headquarters of ASP.A security official present during the raid at Hashmi’s house also said that Hashmi did not resist arrest and was ready to cooperate after being assured he would not be killed.  An officer whose team participated in the raid at Sarosh Siddiqui’s house, told Geo News, “His (Sarosh Siddiqui) father lied to security officials and said he was not present at the house and had gone to offer prayers at a nearby mosque. When policemen moved to the upper portion of the house, Siddiqui opened fire with his two pistols which martyred a policeman and injured another.Siddiqui also attacked an armoured vehicle of the police force and took away an AK-47 rifle.Earlier in September, security forces arrested the head of ASP from Kaneez Fatima society.The group has been involved in multiple terror incidents in Karachi and Mastung, security sources have said.The group first made headlines in Karachi in April this year in the targeted killing of a retired army colonel.Police officials also believe the group is behind several attacks on police officials in Karachi in the past few months and an IED blast targeting security forces in Mastung.The outfit was not inspired by Daesh's ideology, but instead, it was influenced by Al-Qaeda's Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. Initially, it did operate under Daesh's umbrella, however, differences led to the parting of the ways later.The group comprises of militants from Al-Qaeda Subcontinent, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and Daesh, sources said."

648,"Around 72.4% of second-generation of Pakistanis living in Norway are college-educated, almost at par with the statistics for overall Norwegians, reveals a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education of Norway.The statistics show that Pakistanis in Norway have brought their level of college education to almost that of native Norwegians – an impressive feat for the Pakistani immigrant community.The survey, which was published in an online Norwegian newspaper, also reveals that the second generation of immigrant women will soon achieve higher education levels equal to those of other Norwegians.Four years ago, 70.6% of all pupils in Norway had completed high school/intermediate education. The proportion of Norwegian-born pupils with immigrant parents such as Pakistanis stood at 66.3%.Teachers, students and their parents worked hard in last four years to achieve the increase in the proportion of college-educated population, the report stated, adding that many of the new-generation with foreign background became positive contributors to the national economy. The report contained example of a Norwegian journalist of Pakistani origin, Kadafi Zaman, whose parents migrated to Norway in 1970s, after being born and raised in a village in Gujrat.“I am proud that my parents were educated and they took care of my education with all of their attention,” said Kadafi Zaman. His father, Chaudhry Zaman, also expressed satisfaction at the education of his children, including Kadafi. Talking to Geo News, Deputy Mayor of Drammen city of Norway Syed Yousaf Gilani said that the new generation of Pakistanis in Norway is not only ahead in education but is also playing an active role in the country’s politics.

650,"PEKANBARU: A giant python attacked an Indonesian man, nearly severing his arm, before hungry villagers chopped up the reptile and ate it, a police chief said Wednesday.Security guard Robert Nababan crossed paths with the giant creature while patrolling an oil palm plantation in the remote Batang Gansal subdistrict of Sumatra island on Saturday.""The python was 7.8 metres long (25.6 feet), it was unbelievably huge,"" local police chief Sutarja, who like many Indonesians only has one name, told AFP.Sutarja said the 37-year-old Nababan, who sometimes liked to eat snake, tried to catch the giant python and stuff it in a gunny sack.But the huge serpent fought back and bit him on his left arm, nearly severing it from his body.Nababan was then rushed to a hospital in a neighbouring town for treatment.The police chief said the intervention of another security guard and several local residents, one of whom hit the snake with a log, helped to save the man´s life.Hungry locals later killed the snake and displayed its body in the village before dicing it up, frying it and feasting on it.Giant python, which regularly top 20 feet in length, are commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines.In March, a 25-year-old Indonesian farmer has been discovered inside the belly of a giant python after the swollen snake was caught near where the man vanished while harvesting his crops on the eastern island of Sulawesi."
651,"Following the dismissal of the former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, there has been much chaos amongst the peers of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, some of which has boiled over and spilled out into the open.In one inner circle, there was fear that Sharif’s politics had ended the moment he left the country. Tending to his ailing wife, he was unlikely to return. In another quarter, there was hope that his younger brother, Shehbaz Sharif, would step up and lead them in this turbulent time. But then Sharif returned last week – although a rumor had it that his return was due to his expiring visa rather than any real desire for a homecoming. However, I would not pay much heed to this rumour because, if the former prime minister did not wish to return, he could have easily extended his visa from abroad. Nawaz Sharif has been in politics for over three decades now. He won't let trivial matters hold him back, or on the contrary, force his hand. He came home, in my opinion, to ensure that his grip on the party remains strong.Then there was also the matter of who would be the PML-N party president and, more importantly, if his party wins the next elections, who would be the prime minister? For both slots, Shehbaz Sharif was a favorite. But on Tuesday, Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party president for four years. According to party insiders, the elder Sharif didn’t want to hand over the reins of his political dynasty to his younger sibling. Shehbaz, by most accounts, is a sagacious politician who could outpace his elder brother.So now that leaves only one unanswered question: If in power again, who will be the premier? We will have to wait for this one.When the ex-prime minister landed in Pakistan, there was an unprecedented haste in the government circles to pass bills and legislation that would allow Sharif back into the driving seat of his party.On Tuesday, during the party convention, an emboldened Sharif thundered down on his opponents. He warned his enemies using a stanza of poetry to emphasise that he would not beg and plead for what is rightly his, again. He sent a loud and clear message to those it was meant for, a day after they sent him theirs through blocking the interior minister from entering court premises.Nawaz Sharif is angry about his removal, as are his party leaders. But the anger, if not restrained, could damage the democracy Sharif promises to protect.On the other hand, it seems that Shehbaz Sharif understands the consequences of disrupting this balance. According to those privy to developments, he flew to London earlier this month to convince his elder brother to return to Pakistan. And now he wants his brother to also avoid confrontation. These reservations were clearly laid out in his speech at the convention, where he castigated those advisors who gave misleading counsel. He, instead, insisted that advice should only be sought from within 'the family'.Despite some disappointments, and family rivalries, Shehbaz Sharif is still standing with his brother supporting his role as the leader of the party. Maybe Nawaz should listen. "
652,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) representative Fawad Chaudhry on Wednesday claimed that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar will be behind bars within three months.Speaking outside Supreme Court, Chaudhry said that the finance minister should immediately resign taking in consideration economic instability in the country due to the graft cases he is facing.“Take a look at Pakistan Stock Exchange. Where is the country’s economy heading,” he added.The PTI spokesperson said that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi should start thinking about the country than saving his disqualified leader.He also said that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Hanif Abbasi misled Supreme Court by giving a wrong affidavit stating that PTI leader Jahanghir Tareen was named in Panama Papers.“Abbasi should be sent to jail for three years for giving wrong affidavit,” he said.Chaudhry said that the party’s legal team is reviewing the election reforms bill recently passed from national assembly, and may soon file a petition against it.He questioned that when all the parties have consensus that National Accountability Bureau laws are not completely functional and needs required amendments, then why two parties are adamant to appoint a NAB chairman.“It clearly shows that they are not serious,” he said. “Our 12-member team will present their draft on NAB laws. We will present our model to parliament and media for debate.” "
653,"KARACHI: A probe into serious security lapses at the Karachi Central Jail (KCJ) has proposed that the Inspector General (IG) Prisons Nusrat Manghan and Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Prisons Karachi Region Ashraf Ali Nizmani be replaced with immediate effect, it surfaced on Wednesday.Law enforcement agencies conducted a raid at the prison last week, and took custody of two terror convicts who were recruiting inmates for Daesh, sources informed Geo News.“The inquiry has found that all layers of security have loopholes, leading to security lapses,” the inquiry officer Additional IG Crime Branch Aftab Pathan observed. “Superintendent Jail, Deputy Superintendent, and assistant superintendent are responsible for these loopholes and lapses.”Jail officials and IG Prisons are responsible for the repeated security lapses, according to the inquiry report which has proposed that the entire jail staff at the city's central jail be replaced on an immediate basis.The report, which has been submitted to the home ministry, has also proposed that Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers should be installed as the IG Prisons Sindh, DIG Prisons Sindh, and Jail Superintendent of Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur regions.A report that surfaced in September disclosed that up to 30 prisoners were recruited from inside the jail premises by Daesh.Law-enforcement agencies arrested two looking over the recruitmentOf the 30 prisoners recruited into the banned group, 12 have been released on bail and their whereabouts are unknown, sources told Geo News.Law enforcement agencies have since then raided the residences of the Daesh recruits released on bail but have not been able to trace the missing individuals.A Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) report had highlighted an 'alarming' security situation at the Karachi Central JailEarlier, a report by the Counter-Terrorism Department has revealed that terrorists imprisoned at Central Jail Karachi had access to the prison’s record room and sensitive document. "
654,"LAS VEGAS: Photographs leaked Tuesday from the hotel room of the Las Vegas shooter showed scope-mounted assault rifles, a floor covered with expended shells and what appears to be a note left on a table.Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said that Stephen Paddock, the man who murdered 59 people from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, also had cameras in his room, including one apparently monitoring the corridor approach.Lombardo said his department was investigating the photographs from inside and outside the room published by Boston 25 TV station and Germany´s Bild magazine.One showed the apparent body of the shooter next to two assault rifles mounted on bipods, his feet next to a table with an apparent hand-written note on it.Other pictures from the scene show a neatly stacked pile of ammunition clips, and other rifles piled up on lounge chairs.A picture outside the room shows bullet holes through the door, possibly those made when Paddock fired at hotel security guards outside the door, hitting one in the leg.Lombardo said Paddock shot from the hotel window down at the crowd of about 22,000 at a country music concert late Sunday for about nine minutes in total.59 people have been confirmed dead in the massacre and about 500 were treated in hospitals for a range of wounds and injuries.Lombardo said there was still nothing clear about the motivation of the shooter, a 64-year-old regular gambler who owned numerous properties and had no known associations with political, radical or hate groups.He did not comment on the content of the pictures, but confirmed Paddock had used a ""bump stock"" on at least one of the weapons, which in effect turned it into an automatic rifle that can shoot hundreds of rounds a minute.Outside the room investigators found one of the cameras mounted on a room service cart in the hallway, possibly giving Paddock a view of anyone approaching the room.""I´m not aware of any transmission. But there were cameras,"" Lombardo said.47 firearms from three locations. Piles of ammunition, and devices that converted assault rifles to automatic weapons that fired like machine guns. How did Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock amass an arsenal of firearms? In the United States, and particularly in states like Nevada, it´s easy. And totally legal.Although the country is notorious for its lax gun laws, there are some restrictions on multiple sales of handguns. But if someone wants to build up a cache of rifles the way Paddock did, they could do so without anyone noticing.Most gun sales are by federally licensed vendors who must put buyers through background checks. The FBI will run their name through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which refers to three databases of offenders. Those databases are not always perfect, relying on often spotty reporting from the states. Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine people in an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina on June 17, 2015, cleared a handgun purchase background check just weeks before, despite having a drug conviction on his record.But if a person´s record is clean -- and Paddock evidently did not raise any red flags -- he can buy as many guns as he wants.There are some controls, points out Laura Cutilletta, the legal director at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.Licensed gun dealers, who handle perhaps 60 percent of all firearm sales, have to report multiple handgun sales to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ""Multiple"" means two or more guns to the same purchaser within five business days. Even then, Cutilletta says, ""There is no requirement that law enforcement investigate.""Three states -- California, New York and New Jersey -- prohibit sales of more than one handgun in 30 to 90 days, with slight variations between them. Beyond that, the country is an open market, with private sellers of used guns in most states not having to run background checks, and few restrictions on long gun purchases.In Nevada, where gun laws are particularly lax and enforcement more so, it would have been easy for Paddock to accumulate all the guns he had unnoticed. ""There is no way that ATF or the FBI would know,"" said Cutilletta.But what stood out in Sunday´s massacre, when Paddock unloaded his guns on a crowd of 22,000 at a country music concert, was the rapid pace of fire. According to reports, he had modified some of his guns to work like automatic weapons, like machine guns, able to shoot many hundreds of rounds a minute with one trigger pull.Automatic weapons have been banned in the United States for three decades. But converting a semi-automatic weapon, including the AR-15 and AK-47-type assault rifles widely available in US gun shops, into an automatic weapon is easy.For $40 you can buy a trigger crank, a small device that can be attached to the trigger. It can make the gun fire three or four times with each turn of the crank, significantly faster than using a finger to pull the trigger.For as little as $99, you can get a bump stock, a spring-loaded stock that, with one pull of the trigger, keeps the weapon firing using its own recoil. It can enable the weapon to fire at a rate of 600 rounds a minute or more.Danley, an Australian citizen reported to have been born in the Philippines, had been sharing Paddock’s condoTrigger cranks and bump stocks are completely legal, they even come with ATF certifications that they do not constitute an illegal conversion of the guns. Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo confirmed Tuesday that Paddock had at least one of the devices.The leaked photographs from the hotel room showed that Paddock also had a large stock of ammunition. That side of the guns industry is also little-regulated, with only restrictions on sales of certain types of ammunition like armor-piercing bullets. Otherwise, anyone can buy bullets in volume -- with no questions asked."
655,"LAHORE: The unofficial death penalty moratorium that was in place during the last Pakistan People’s Party government was lifted in December 2014. Since then, 477 prisoners have been executed at the astonishing rate of four per week. Despite data showing that the death penalty does not lead to a decrease in crime, executions continue unabated in Pakistan.To commemorate the World Day Against the Death Penalty, which falls on October 10, the Lahore-based Justice Project Pakistan, in collaboration with the Azad Theatre and Highlight Arts has launched a unique project titled, Bus Kar Do. The initiative will include a week-long bus tour through several cities of Punjab and Sindh.Once the bus arrives in a city, the actors will travel to the heart of the local community and perform the play “Intezar- The Wait.” The play is based on real life stories of prisoners waiting on death row, some of whom have been executed by now. In line with the global theme of poverty and injustice, Bus Kar Do aims to bring more awareness surrounding the death penalty’s systemic targeting of the poor and the vulnerable of the society.The JPP will also set up postcard booths where onlookers can write to President Mamoon Hussain, asking for clemency for Abdul Basit, a paralyzed prisoner on death row for a decade, who has twice come within seconds of being executed."

657,"BEIJING: Maria Sharapova opened up on the despair she feels in defeat after she was ruthlessly knocked out of the China Open in the third round by Romania's Simona Halep on Wednesday.The world number two was an emphatic 6-2, 6-2 winner to leave five-time Grand Slam champion, Sharapova, still searching for her first title since returning from a doping ban in April.It was the 26-year-old Halep's first victory over the Russian in eight meetings.Sharapova, a former number one now at 104 in the world rankings following her 15-month suspension for taking meldonium, gave an insight into the rollercoaster of emotions in top-level tennis.""Hard work is not good enough anymore, maybe it was - I don't know how many years ago - but that's just not a factor anymore,"" said the 30-year-old, asked about comments in a book she recently released.""The reason I say that is there's some incredible moments, very high moments, and there are very low moments.""There have been times where I get off the court and you think, I don´t wish this on my future child.""The feeling is so tough and disappointing.""Halep, the second seed on Beijing's outdoor hard courts, is the first woman into the quarter-finals, where she will play either defending champion Agnieszka Radwanska or Daria Kasatkina of Russia.With world number one Garbine Muguruza exiting in the first round with a virus, Halep is now favourite.Sharapova said it was the best Halep had played against her -- and Halep agreed.The two met in the first round at the US Open a few weeks ago and Halep said she was delighted to finally taste victory against Sharapova: ""I´m really happy that I could do this.""It's my first victory against her and I just want to enjoy the moment.""Nick Kyrgios said he wanted to make up for his notorious meltdown in Shanghai last year as he beat Mischa Zverev in the second round in Beijing.A year ago the supremely talented but combustible Kyrgios was suspended for his petulant behaviour at the Shanghai Masters, where he argued with the crowd and appeared to give away points in caving into the German journeyman.The enigmatic Australian, seeded eighth in the Chinese capital, smashed his racquet on the floor in anger, bending the head in half, when he conceded the opening set on Wednesday.That earned the world number 19 a warning from the umpire and raised the spectre of one year ago.But the 22-year-old returned for the second set with renewed determination and coasted into the quarter-finals 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.Kyrgios said facing Zverev -- older brother of rising star Alexander -- a year after Shanghai, and again in China, was the perfect opportunity to show how far he has come.""I just wanted to go out there today and kind of redeem myself a little bit from last year,"" he said, adding: ""I just wanted to prove to myself how much I have improved.""During one changeover the Australian appeared so relaxed that he sat back on his chair, arms behind his head, and sang along with a pop hit being played over the stadium loudspeakers.""Nothing really, just chilling out,"" Kyrgios said afterwards, asked about his behaviour.He plays the Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis in the last eight."

659,"SHAH PORIR DWIP: Rohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh amid a fresh exodus from strife-torn Myanmar have described whole villages being emptied and thousands marching to the border as security forces redouble efforts to drive remaining Muslims from their homes.More than 500,000 Muslim Rohingya have fled ethnic bloodshed in Myanmar in the past month and numbers are again swelling, with Bangladesh reporting 4-5,000 civilians now crossing the border each day after a brief lull in arrivals.An estimated 10,000 more have reportedly massed in Myanmar near a crossing point into Bangladesh, and are poised to join the hundreds of thousands of mainly Rohingya refugees eking out survival in wretched camps over the border.The spike in new arrivals - prompted by what Rohingya say is a fresh drive to purge Muslims still in westernmost Rakhine state - casts doubt on a Myanmar proposal aired this week to start repatriating the persecuted minority.Rakhine has been emptied of half of its Rohingya population in weeks, and more are on the move as insecurity presses them to leave villages that have so far been spared the worst of the violence ripping through the state.Rashida Begum, who arrived in Bangladesh late Monday, said local officials assured the Rohingya community for weeks they would be safe if they remained in their village.""(But then) the army came and went door to door, ordering us to leave,"" she told AFP of the military sweep in Maungdaw on Friday.""They said they wouldn´t harm us, but eventually they drove us out and burned our houses.""Begum, 30, fled with her daughter to the coast, where hundreds of Rohingya waited to cross the Naf River dividing Myanmar and Bangladesh.Myanmar state media said the fleeing Rohingya had left ""of their own accord"" despite assurances they would be safe.""I wanted to stay in my village,"" Hasina Khatun, 25, told AFP in the coastal border town of Shah Porir Dwip.""They (local officials) said 'don't go to Bangladesh. Everything will be fine'. We believed them, but nothing improved. Eventually, we had to leave.""Sumaya Bibi, a softly spoken Rohingya teenager, described more than a thousand civilians hiding along the riverbank late Monday.She said they boarded about 10 wooden fishing boats, many overloaded and carrying mainly women and children, and drifted under the cover of darkness across the Naf where they washed up on a remote beach.Reports are difficult to independently verify due to reporting restrictions in Rakhine.Fazlul Haq, a local councillor in the area, said the flow of boats had almost stopped by late September but has resumed in recent days, bringing scores of Rohingya families reporting threats and intimidation by the army.The UN said Tuesday that 509,000 refugees had crossed into Bangladesh as of September 30.The influx began after August 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants spurred a ferocious Myanmar army crackdown that the UN says amounted to ""ethnic cleansing"".Myanmar´s government refuses to recognise the Rohingya as a distinct ethnic group and considers them illegal migrants from Bangladesh.On Monday a Myanmar minister proposed taking back hundreds of thousands of Rohingya, many of whom are at risk of disease in packed makeshift camps along the border but offered no timeline.Violence appears to have ebbed in northern Rakhine, although independent reporting is still blocked by an army lockdown, fear has unsettled many of the Rohingya who remain.Nurul Amin, who arrived Sunday after the military ordered his village to be evacuated, described a long column of Rohingya civilians growing in size as it snaked toward the coast.""As we left, people from villages all around us started joining. They (the Myanmar army) weren't killing anyone, just burning houses,"" he told AFP.Thick plumes of smoke could be seen from Bangladesh rising beyond the border on Tuesday. An EU delegation in Rakhine earlier this week urged an end to the violence after seeing ""villages burned to the ground and emptied of inhabitants"".Amin said there were just ""two, maybe three families in hiding, but no houses"" in the villages surrounding his razed home in Maungdaw.""They too will come in time,"" he said."
660,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Privatisation Minister Daniyal Aziz criticised on Wednesday Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) leader Jahangir Tareen for failing to submit details in the case against him in the Supreme Court. ""Tareen’s record, asked by the court, should be submitted,"" said Aziz. He claimed that Tareen said in court that he cannot submit any records prior to 2010. ""Billions were transferred in the garb of ‘gifts’,"" he said, adding that Nawaz Sharif, during the Panama Papers case hearing, even presented record from 1962.Coming down hard on PTI Chairman Imran Khan, Aziz said the PTI chief has again been summoned to the anti-terrorism court on October 6 in the same complex where the corruption case against Nawaz Sharif is under way. ""Let’s see if he shows up,"" said Aziz, adding that it is sad to see the kind of politics being played out in the country these days. ""What should we expect of institutions now,"" he said, referring to the 'preferential' treatment being meted out to the PTI. ""We want Imran's nomination papers submitted. It is a strange case where the judgment has not been reserved nor decided,"" he said, referring to the Supreme Court's hearing on Tuesday in the Imran disqualification case.Answering a question, he said both Imran and Tareen cannot remain honest and truthful if the legal way takes its course."
661,"ISLAMABAD: State Minister for IT Anusha Rehman said on Wednesday that unique judicial precedence is being set in the country with regards to the proceedings against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his family and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.Addressing the media outside the accountability court after Dar’s hearing, Rehman said it is sad that the honourable judge of the Islamabad High Court dismissed [on Tuesday] Dar’s petition challenging the accountability court order without even issuing notices.“He directed our lawyers that since the Supreme Court has sent the case to the trial court, any objections must be taken up with the apex court-appointed monitoring judge,” informed Rehman.Accountability Court-I is hearing case of possessing assets beyond known sources of income against Finance Minister Ishaq DarShe said members of the legal fraternity are baffled on the speed with which the case is progressing. “Nevertheless, Nawaz, his children and Dar are awaiting justice and will continue to appear in court,” she claimed.However, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader hoped no new precedence will be set in their cases. Talking about a video doing the rounds on social media showing a man in a suit leaving the court premises after Monday’s hearing, she said some suspicious activity has been caught on camera and questions are being raised on the Rangers’ presence in court on Monday when the police and commissioner denied having summoned them.“What are those powers who took control of the court that day. I don’t know if they’ve left or are still here,” she remarked.She also chided the National Accountability Bureau for wasting paper, saying the 23-volume reference against the finance minister consists of 11 volumes of the Panama Joint Investigation Team report which contains merely 10 per cent material on Dar. “NAB has wasted paper making photocopies of unrelated documents,” she said. "
662,"ISLAMABAD: The accountability court hearing the Supreme Court-directed corruption reference against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar recorded the statement of a prosecution witness today. The finance minister was late to court today. As a result, the judge temporarily suspended the hearing until the accused showed up. As Dar reached the court, the hearing went under way. At the last hearing, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had submitted a list of 28 witnesses. Today, NAB produced two witnesses: Ishtiaq Ali of Bank Alfalah and senior vice-president of Al Baraka bank, Tariq Javed. Only Ali recorded his statement with the court and was then cross-examined by Dar's counsel, Advocate Amjad Pervez. Dar's counsel also objected to the documents presented by NAB, saying they are mere photocopies and not verified documents. The hearing was then adjourned until October 12, when one new witness — Shahid Aziz — along with Javed, who appeared today as well, have been summoned. Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal was barred from entering the courts complex during Nawaz' Sharif's hearingCompared to October 2, when the Rangers had taken over security of the judicial complex and disallowed everyone, even the interior minister, to enter the premises to attend the hearing of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the police had complete control of the complex today and the paramilitary force was nowhere to be seen. Eight journalists were allowed to cover today's courtroom proceedings after a delegation of reporters reached an understanding with the court's registrar. Dar was indicted last Wednesday by Accountability Court-I Judge Mohammad Bashir.The finance minister denied the charges and vowed to prove his innocence in courtDar has denied all charges and vowed to prove his innocence in court. He had also challenged his indictment and trial in the Islamabad High Court but the pleas were dismissed. The corruption reference, pertaining to Dar's owning assets that are disproportionate to his known sources of income, was filed by NAB in light of the Supreme Court's July 28 judgment in the Panama Papers case.After skipping his first hearing on September 20, for which a summons had been issued, Dar appeared in court on September 25 after bailable warrants for his arrest had been issued to ensure his presence.Editors note: An earlier version of this report misstated the number of witnesses who recorded their statement as well as the name of a witness. "

664,"LAS VEGAS: The girlfriend of a retiree who killed 58 people and then himself in a shooting rampage in Las Vegas arrived from the Philippines in Los Angeles, where FBI agents hoped to question her about the massacre, law enforcement officials said.Marilou Danley, who US authorities have described as a ""person of interest"" in the investigation, left Manila on Tuesday evening aboard Philippine Airlines Flight PR 102, according to Philippines immigration spokeswoman Antonette Mangrobang.The non-stop flight arrived as scheduled at about 7:30 pm local time on Tuesday (0230 GMT Wednesday) at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), according to the airline tracking website FlightAware.com and passengers from the flight.Mangrobang told Reuters by text message there was no information about whether Danley was traveling with anyone else.A police official in Manila and a law enforcement official in the United States, both speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that Danley left the Philippines unescorted but was being met by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents in Los Angeles.The US source said Danley was not under arrest but that the FBI hoped she would consent to be interviewed voluntarily.The police official in Manila said Danley's trip back to the United States ""was coordinated with FBI authorities"" and that she was returning to clear her name of any involvement in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.Stephen Paddock, her live-in companion who killed himself moments before police stormed the Las Vegas hotel suite he had transformed into a sniper's nest on Sunday night, left no clear clues about why he staged his attack on an outdoor concert below the high-rise building.Law enforcement authorities are hoping to obtain some answers from Danley, who according to public records and police shared Paddock's condo in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada, about 90 miles (145 km) northeast of Las Vegas.The Philippine police official said authorities in Manila were told that Paddock used identification belonging to Danley, who has an Australian passport, when checking in to the Las Vegas hotel.Investigators are also examining a $100,000 wire transfer that Paddock sent to an account in the Philippines that appeared to be intended for Danley, a senior US homeland security official told Reuters on Tuesday.The official, who has been briefed regularly on the probe but spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators were working on the assumption that the money was intended as a form of life insurance payment to Danley.The official said US authorities were eager to question Danley about whether Paddock encouraged her to leave the United States before going on his rampage.Danley arrived in Manila on Sept. 15, more than two weeks before the mass shooting in Las Vegas, then flew to Hong Kong on Sept. 22 and returned in Manila on Sept. 25. She was there until she flew to LAX on Tuesday night, according to a Philippine immigration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.Danley, an Australian citizen aged 62 who is reported to have been born in the Philippines, was not seen by reporters in any public area of the LAX arrival terminal.A flight attendant from the plane declined to comment, as did an airline manager at the terminal, citing privacy concerns, when asked if they had seen Danley. One passenger told Reuters she overheard members of the flight crew saying that one of them had escorted Danley from the plane.The New York Times reported Danley has a daughter who lives in Los Angeles.Fresh details about the massacre and the arsenal Paddock amassed emerged on Tuesday.Police said Paddock strafed the concert crowd with bullets for nine to 11 minutes before taking his own life, and had set up cameras inside and outside his hotel suite so he could see police as they closed in on his location.A total of 47 firearms were recovered from three locations searched by investigators - Paddock’s hotel suite, his home in Mesquite, and another property associated with him in Reno, Nevada, according to Jill Snyder, special agent for the US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).Snyder said 12 of the guns found in the hotel room were fitted with so-called bump-stock devices that allow the guns to be fired virtually as automatic weapons. The devices are legal under US law, even though fully automatic weapons are for the most part banned.The rifles, shotguns and pistols were purchased in four states - Nevada, Utah, California and Texas - Snyder told reporters at an evening news conference.A search of Paddock’s car turned up a supply of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be formed into explosives and was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing of a federal office building that killed 168 people, Lombardo said earlier.Police also confirmed that photos widely published online showing the gunman’s body, his hands in gloves, lying on the floor beside two firearms and spent shell casings, were authentic crime-scene images obtained by media outlets. An internal investigation was under way to determine how they were leaked.Video footage of the shooting spree on Sunday night caught by those on the ground showed throngs of people screaming in horror, some crouching in the open for cover, hemmed in by fellow concert-goers, and others running for cover as extended bursts of gunfire rained onto the crowd of some 20,000.Police had put the death toll at 59 earlier on Tuesday, not including the gunman. However, the coroner’s office revised the confirmed tally to 58 dead, plus Paddock, on Tuesday night.More than 500 people were injured, some trampled in the pandemonium. At least 20 of the survivors admitted to one of several hospitals in the area, University Medical Center, remained in critical condition on Tuesday, doctors said.The union representing firefighters disclosed that a dozen off-duty firefighters who were attending the music festival were shot while trying to render aid to other spectators, two of them while performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on victims.“This is a true feat of heroism on their part,” said Ray Rahne of the International Association of Fire Fighters.But the central, unanswered question to the bloodshed was what drove the gunman’s actions.Federal, state and local investigators have found no evidence that Paddock had even incidental contacts with foreign or domestic extremist groups, and reviews of his history showed no underlying pattern of criminal behavior or hate speech, the homeland security official said.While investigators had not ruled out the possibility of mental illness or some form of brain injury, “there’s no evidence of that, either,” the official said.Paddock’s brother, Eric, has said he was mystified by the attack.His trip to Las Vegas will be the first time he has had to deal directly with the tragic aftermath of deadly gun violence“It just makes less sense the more we use any kind of reason to figure it out,” Eric Paddock said in a text message on Tuesday. “I will bet any amount of money that they will not find any link to anything ... he did this completely by himself.”He said the family did not plan to hold a funeral for his brother, who was not religious, saying it could attract unwanted attention. He described his brother as a financially well-off enthusiast of video poker and cruises, with no history of mental health issues.President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that Paddock had been “a sick man, a demented man.”The attack stirred the fractious debate about gun ownership in the United States, which is protected by the Second Amendment of the Constitution, and about how much that right should be subject to controls.Sunday’s shooting followed the massacre of 26 young children and educators in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, and the slaying of 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last year.The latter attack was previously the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.Democrats reiterated what is generally the party’s stance, that legislative action is needed to reduce mass shootings. Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress, argue restrictions on lawful gun ownership cannot deter criminal behavior.“We’ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by,” said Trump, who strongly supported gun rights during his presidential campaign.Paddock seemed unlike the troubled, angry young men who experts said have come to embody the mass-shooter profile in the United States.Public records on Paddock point to an itinerant existence across the U.S. West and Southeast, including stints as an apartment manager and aerospace industry worker. He appeared to be settling in to a quiet life when he bought a home in a Nevada retirement community a few years ago."

668,"A bus departs Lahore today. It carries 15 actors. For the next seven days, they will pretend to be prisoners as part of a campaign whimsically but aptly titled ‘Bus Kar Do.’ Frankly, after 477 bodies have hanged in less than three years, we should really know when to say when – when to say enough.Long waiting times are characteristic of Pakistan’s criminal justice system. Waiting for things to move forward, waiting for verdicts, waiting for justice, which often isn’t, as promised, served. It is from this required patience that the play’s name is inspired – ‘Intezar.’ Whoever ends up on Pakistan’s death row might as well get comfortable. They could be there a while.There is Aamir, a man who was paralysed as a direct result of jail negligence. There is Shagufta, a woman tortured into silence, and also Bilal – a prisoner who taught hundreds of his fellow inmates before being executed for an unintentional killing. We meet Awais, arrested as a 16-year-old and killed by the state and the media after a torture-induced confession. Mustafa, a prisoner repeatedly diagnosed as schizophrenic, is shunned by the courts who don’t think of the disease as a mental disorder.Even if there is some degree of artistic licence at play here, none of these stories is fiction.Their stories are powerful, and will be performed all the way from Sahiwal to Karachi, right in the streets. Their stories resonate, because they are real – based on true accounts of prisoners scattered all over the country’s prisons. But mostly, their stories terrify. They could happen to anyone, anywhere at any time.But while the actors can switch off their personas as soon as the performance is done, their characters continue to live on. In crowded jail cells in Faisalabad, Vehari, Sahiwal, Lahore and Karachi.The visual depiction of the very real consequences of our justice system is designed to confront the audience with what it really means to support the death penalty in Pakistan. And make no mistake, the death penalty in Pakistan has gone too far. We have hanged the mentally ill, and have brought many more to the brink of executions. We have hanged juvenile offenders, men who entered the jail as teenagers and left as old men in body bags. We have carried a man unable to stand on his own to the gallows, only to return him to a jail cell because there is no way to hang him without botching his execution.October 10, World Day Against the Death Penalty, is an annual accounting of the irreversible punishment. Activists around the world take stock of how many lives have been ended by the state and for what, and how we can continue the global trend towards abolition. Bus Kar Do seeks to remind us of where we stand in that momentum.This year, the theme agreed upon is the deadly mix of poverty and justice. Pakistan understands this relationship well, particular those citizens with shallow pockets. While needy defendants are entitled to legal representation at the expense of the state, this does not necessarily mean that they are being adequately protected. There is little wonder why ‘justice’ in the form of executions only comes for those who don’t reside in the A-Class prison cells.This is precisely why this bus is travelling across the country, with a theatrical manifestation of what’s at stake if meaningful criminal justice reforms do not take place.The audience must not look away. The death penalty could very well never be their problem – until it is.The writer works for Justice Project Pakistan, a human rights law firm based in Lahore.Twitter: @Rimmel_MohydinThis article was originally published in The News"

It was after his death that I came to know about his association with Lashkar-e-Taiba.I knew what to expect at his home when I went for condolences. Two years earlier, the Lashkar had made the mistake of giving me access to their sprawling headquarters in Muridke near Lahore. I was given a chance to interview dozens of its fighters and commanders as well as family members of slain fighters. I also had a chance to visit the home of Hafiz Saeed where I met some of his close relatives and interviewed him at his office at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET). My special report in a leading magazine where I then worked ended up extremely upsetting the organisation – and remains one of the most cited sources on the organisation.Due to my strong interest in the rituals and anthropology of death, I had noted that the organisation was inventing rituals that had no precedence in Islamic societies. These rituals mainly involved celebrating the death of its martyrs. So I had to congratulate the family on the martyrdom of the young man and I would be served sweets.I could not muster the courage to congratulate the old man and he did not follow the rituals. After all, I was like his son. He showed me Sajid’s notebooks where he had written S after his name. “I did not know what S stood for till the news of his death reached us – S stands for Shaheed”, he said. As I had seen in other cases, the family had become deeply religious and the father had grown a flowing beard. I had already met a father, called ‘Abu Shaheedain’ (Father of two martyrs), who wanted to go to Kashmir because he did not have a third son to offer for fighting.I found that just as the Tableeghi Jamaat has reduced Islam to its brand of Tableegh, the Lashkar had reduced the religion of peace to its brand of jihad (or Qital to use the proper vocabulary). Some Deobandi scholars assert that instead of preaching religion (Tableegh-e-Deen), the Tableeghi Jamaat has created a religion of preaching (Deen-e-Tableegh). I don’t want to say the same about the Lashkar because I do not enjoy the authority of a Deobandi scholar.My exposure to Lashkar-e-Taiba challenged many generalisations I had made about members of militant organisations. I had reported on militant and sectarian organisations for years, regularly visiting their dens, which were no-go areas for outsiders and law-enforcement personnel. I had seen how they bullied the locals and kept them in constant fear.Militancy, after all, is deviant behaviour – like other crimes. A militant dissociates himself from the larger society and tries to inflict pain on the mainstream. In case of the Lashkar, I found that it was quite the opposite. Its fighters thought that they were sacrificing themselves for the sake of the country and the larger society. There was a socio-economic reason behind it. Unlike other militant groups, the Lashkar’s recruits belonged to the lower middle class of Central Punjab and had attended government school. They appeared to believe from their heart of hearts what they were taught in their Pakistan Studies classes.The Lashkar’s fighters were not supposed to keep arms at their homes. They were rather required to serve their communities till they were called to make the ultimate sacrifice. I found that they were full of humour and energy and were often the darlings of their mohallas and villages. “What wonders we can do with this kind of youth”, I had thought.Much has been made of the ideology of militants. ‘Mind-set’ is one of the most popular terms with our commentators. This term, however, does not exist in any psychology or sociology textbook. I did not find the ideology of Lashkar fighters any different from what our children are learning through their school textbooks. Every nation prepares its soldiers for death and teaches them a variant of the ideology of legitimate warfare – which is called jihad in Islam. In Pakistan, soldiers have administered the medicine back on the whole nation.Four decades of research on terrorism in psychology has yielded nothing. We can conclude that what is most important in this regard is ‘How’, not ‘Why’. Indian Muslims are far more sectarian than Pakistani Muslims. You can find dozens of YouTube videos where men of the whole village have been required to redo the nikkah ceremony because they dared to pray behind an imam of another sect. However, Indian mosques and imam bargahs are safe for worshippers.Iqbal, perhaps the greatest Muslim thinker of the 20th century, was declared an apostate by an authority no less than the Imam of Kaaba. The move to push him out of the pale of Islam was spearheaded by the Khateeb of Lahore’s second most important mosque, Wazir Khan Masjid. However, he never felt that his life was under any threat and no one dared to use violent means against him. The last laugh belonged to him and not to his tormentors.In contemporary Pakistan, the JUI has asserted on many occasions that its differences with the sectarian Sipah-e-Sahaba are confined to methodology alone. In the world of organisations, methodology trumps ideology – process is everything.Mainstreaming provides an answer to the ‘how’ question. It makes the militant groups change their tools from guns to microphones. Guerrillas are hard to defeat in the battlefield. In the democratic arena, they can be outnumbered and outgunned too easily. Islamist groups are a huge threat in countries like Egypt where their democratic rights and the freedom of association was trampled. In countries like Pakistan, they are routinely humiliated on the ballot box by the ‘secular’ parties.Syed Maudoodi did us a great favour when he converted his Islamist movement into a political party during its most controversial annual gathering in 1956. Hafiz Saeed appears to be doing us the same favour. However, no one appears happy because many questions remain unanswered.Mainstreaming is often part of a well-debated and well-thought-out strategy. It usually requires a legislative process to grant amnesty to a group or individuals if they have broken the law or committed any crime. If such a policy has been devised, we are not aware of its contours. In the absence of an open relinquishing of arms by a militant group, a political party can be just a political adjunct to a militant outfit.Mainstream political parties like the PML-N have other reasons to worry as well. During the last three decades, voters of religious parties have become mainstreamed. They have left religious parties and joined larger national parties. This mainstreaming of the religious voter has reduced the leverage enjoyed by the establishment over the mainstream parties. The PML-N fears that this process is being reversed artificially.Rightly or wrongly, the religious voter is angry. In my opinion, it must be given the political means to express its feelings. For decades, we failed to curb this criminal association. In our zeal, we should not put tabs on the legitimate freedom of association guaranteed in our constitution.Personally, I would be happy if Sajid were to become a leader of the Milli Muslim League (MML), rather than a fighter who died in Kashmir. This at least would have given me a chance to argue with him. It would also have saved his father from the pain of serving sweets to those who came to condole with him.The writer is an anthropologist and development professional.This was originally published in The News."

672,"Thousands of festival-goers packed a historic neighbourhood of Hong Kong to watch a ""fire dragon"" lit with incense sticks dance through the streets in a century-old ritual.The 67-metre (220-foot) long dragon snakes around the network of narrow paths in the village of Tai Hang each year to the sound of roaring drums, and is one of the highlights of the celebrations for Wednesday's mid-autumn festival.Around 300 performers carry the dragon through the neighbourhood for three consecutive evenings as it billows smoke, shaking and dipping its head and tail to the beat of the drums.Only men -- former and current Tai Hang residents of all ages -- can be part of the dragon's body, but in recent years women have cracked through the all-male spectacle to become lead drummers.The tradition is said to have started around 1880, after the once sleepy coastal village was hit by a typhoon, followed by a plague.Desperate to change its fortunes, villagers created a ""fire dragon"" and paraded it for three days and three nights, chasing away the plague, according to local lore.After years of land reclamation and gentrification, Tai Hang now lies inland from Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour and is home to upmarket restaurants and luxury condominiums, though a flavour of the old days remains.""The community now is very different. Many old residents have left the neighbourhood. The mid-autumn festival every year is a good opportunity for all of us old residents to have a gathering,"" said Cheung Kwok-ho.A Tai Hang native, Cheung is a maker of the dragon, planted with tens of thousands of burning incense sticks during the festival -- now on China's list of intangible cultural heritage.Work to assemble the dragon starts weeks in advance, its body consisting of a hemp rope ""spine"" wrapped with heaps of straws which are then tightly secured by metal wires.Its makers say the humble but resilient materials for the dragon can, with expertise, be sculpted into a mighty creature.""It requires skills to bend the rattan and create its shape before you strap on the straws, which are very thin,"" Chan Tak-fai, the dance's chief commander, told AFP.""It's important to show its vigour,"" Chan said as he pointed to the dragon head's skeletal features, which would be guided during the dance by two swivelling ""pearls"" -- Chinese grapefruits also studded with glowing incense sticks.Chan, 71, inherited the trade from elders after he began observing the dragon's making in the streets of Tai Hang when he was five. He joined the team in the 1970s when he was in his twenties.The materials for the dragon are increasingly hard to source, Chan said, with the bulk of it now imported from mainland China.But the methods for creating it remains the same as the festival enters its 138th year.The spectators cheering on the fire dragon Tuesday said they were electrified by the atmosphere, not to mention the fiery and smoky effects.""You can see the veterans speeding about tirelessly and working very hard to preserve this tradition... It looks magnificent,"" said Ventus Siu, 27."
673,"ISLAMABAD: Supreme Court Justice Umar Ata Bandial remarked on Wednesday that the motive behind hiding an offshore company is to hide wealth.He made the observation while hearing a disqualification petition against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Jehangir Tareen.A three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar and comprising Justice Bandial and Justice Faisal Arab, was hearing a petition filed by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) against Tareen and PTI Chairman Imran Khan seeking their disqualification.The petition alleges that Tareen owns offshore companies in the name of his children, shared gifts worth over Rs1.6 billion among family members, and was involved in insider trading in the shares of United Sugar Mills Limited in 2005.Three-member bench adjourns PTI leader's disqualification caseJustice Bandial further remarked that it is mandatory to declare assets and wealth [for politicians seeking public office] as per the law.Tareen’s lawyer Sikander Mohmand, presenting his arguments, said that the petition has been filed as a tit for tat for a petition against ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif filed by Tareen.“The petition has been filed on a political basis,” he said. Mohmand also said that Abbasi misled the court that Tareen's name appeared in the leaked Panama papers, whereas it did not.The hearing has been adjourned until tomorrow.When asked in the previous hearings what grounds he seeks to disqualify the lawmaker, Abbasi’s counsel had replied to the bench that Tareen failed to declare his offshore companies, did not pay agro tax and committed insider trading. He added that the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) sent a notice to Tareen over insider trading as wellJustice Bandial, addressing Abbasi's counsel, observed that the petitioner has not provided any material regarding Tareen's offshore company. The judge wondered why the counsel brought forward the matter of the offshore company if he did not have sufficient material on it.The counsel informed the bench that Tareen showed his agriculture revenue to be Rs540 million to the Federal Board of Revenue whereas the same was shown as Rs120 million to the Election Commission of Pakistan. He said the difference is of Rs420 million in 2010.Chief Justice Nisar responded that if he paid less income tax then it is a matter between Tareen and the income tax authorities.This is not our concern as we are looking at issues of being honest and truthful, the chief justice observed further.At an even earlier hearing, the bench had sought answers to five questions from Tareen’s counsel.The questions were when was Tareen's trust formed, when was the offshore company formed, who’s the legal and beneficial owner of the company, when and for how much was the offshore company formed, and how many times did he give funds as gifts to his children from 2002-17."

675,"COX‘S BAZAR: Humanitarian organisations helping Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh said on Wednesday they need $434 million over the next six months to help up to 1.2 million people, most of them children, in dire need of life-saving assistance.There are an estimated 809,000 Rohingya sheltering in Bangladesh after fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar, more than half a million of whom have arrived since Aug. 25 to join 300,000 Rohingya who are already there.“The Rohingya population in Cox’s Bazar is highly vulnerable, many having experienced severe trauma, and are now living in extremely difficult conditions,” Robert Watkins, U.N. resident coordinator in Bangladesh, said in a statement, referring to the area where most Rohingya are living.Bangladesh and humanitarian organizations are struggling to help the 509,000 Rohingya who have arrived since attacks by Rohingya militants in August triggered a Myanmar military offensive that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing.Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing. It says its forces are fighting insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who claimed responsibility for attacks on about 30 police posts and an army camp on Aug 25.The insurgents were also behind similar but smaller attacks in October last year that led to a brutal Myanmar army response triggering the flight of 87,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh.The aid agencies’ plan factors in the possibility of another 91,000 refugees arriving, as the influx continues, Watkins said.“The plan targets 1.2 million people, including all Rohingya refugees, and 300,000 Bangladeshi host communities over the next six months,” he said.Aid groups seek $434 million for Rohingya crisis for next six months.Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.She has condemned rights abuses and said Myanmar was ready to start a process agreed with Bangladesh in 1993 under which anyone verified as a refugee would be accepted back.But many Rohingya are pessimistic about their chances of going home, partly because few have official papers confirming their residency.Most are also wary about returning without an assurance of citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and discrimination they have endured for years.Human Rights Watch said it had found evidence that the Myanmar military had summarily executed dozens of Rohingya in a village called Maung Nu in Rakhine state, on Aug. 27, two days after the insurgent attacks triggered the violence.The rights group said it had spoken to 14 survivors and witnesses who were now refugees in Bangladesh. They described how soldiers entered a compound where people had gathered in fear of military retaliation.“They took several dozen Rohingya men and boys into the courtyard and then shot or stabbed them to death. Others were killed as they tried to flee,” said the rights group, which has accused Myanmar of crimes against humanity.Spokesmen for the government, the military and police did not answer their telephones and were not available for comment. Wednesday is a holiday in Myanmar.Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.The U.N. committees for women’s and children’s rights called on Myanmar to immediately stop violence in Rakhine State, saying violations “being committed at the behest of the military and other security forces” may amount to crimes against humanity.The United States and Britain have warned that the crisis risked derailing Myanmar’s progress in its transition to democracy after decades of military rule.The World Bank said it could hit foreign investment, though it did not factor the violence into its latest forecast for Myanmar’s growth, which it cut by 0.5 percentage points for both 2017 and 2018, to 6.4 percent and 6.7 percent, respectively.The bank said businesses appeared to have delayed investment as they awaited a clearer government economic agenda."

The speaker said: “It is a clerical error. There is no big deal to make a correction on any wrong, the nomination paper will be restored in its original form.”The press conference was held after a meeting of the parliamentary leaders with Sadiq on the issue.Speaking on the occasion, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that the National Assembly’s rules of procedure will be relaxed tomorrow to bring an amendment in the House.“It is a very sensitive issue. People of Pakistan are very anxious on the development and it should be resolved as soon as possible.”“We have also recommended the government to review clause 203 as well,” Qureshi added.Representing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in the press conference, Law Minister Zahid Hamid also confirmed the press that the oath will be restored to its original form.Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam(Fazl) leader Akram Durrani said that the government assured his party that not a single change will be made in the nomination paper.“I said it in the assembly that this is a very sensitive issue which should not be delayed.”Earlier, as the assembly passed the amended elections bill 2017 to pave the way for ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif to become the president of his political party once more, reports had surfaced that the government had inadvertently replaced ""I take an oath"" with ""I believe"" on the oath taken by parliamentarians. "
677,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday to try to soothe a city shaken by the deadliest shooting spree in modern US history in a trip that will test his ability to console a grieving nation.His trip to Las Vegas will be the first time he has had to deal directly with the tragic aftermath of deadly gun violence that has routinely claimed hundreds of lives in recent years.“It’s a very horrible thing even to think about,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday. “It’s really horrible.”Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old retiree with no criminal record, was identified as the gunman in Sunday night’s mass shooting, spraying bullets from the window of his 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas.Authorities said 59 people were killed and more than 500 injured from a crowd of thousands gathered to watch an outdoor country music festival. Paddock’s motive remained a mystery.“He’s a sick man, a demented man. A lot of problems, I guess. We are looking into him very, very seriously. But we’re dealing with a very, very sick individual,” Trump said of Paddock on Tuesday.Trump has had mixed success in the traditional role of “consoler-in-chief.” He inflamed racial tensions in the aftermath of a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virgina, and he has struggled to strike the right tone in responding to hurricane devastation in Puerto Rico.Visiting Puerto Rico on Tuesday, Trump said jokingly that the recovery from Hurricane Maria there was blowing the US budget “a little out of whack.” He spent most of his day meeting with people charged with responding to the crisis than with people affected by it.The Las Vegas shooting has reignited a debate in Washington and across the country about whether more gun control legislation might have prevented what happened.Republicans who control the US Congress have shown little inclination to respond to Democratic appeals for gun measures, although momentum appears to have slowed for legislation that would make it easier to buy gun silencers.On the campaign trail last year, Trump aligned himself with gun rights advocates who consider the US Constitution’s Second Amendment right to bear arms sacrosanct.Asked on Tuesday whether it was time to debate gun control measures, Trump said: “Perhaps that will come. But that’s not for now.”Trump has responded to the Las Vegas massacre by holding a moment of silence on the White House South Lawn and ordering flags lowered to half-staff. He called the shootings “an act of pure evil.”In Las Vegas, the president will grieve with friends and family of the victims, offer support for the wounded and thank first responders, the White House said.Trump has some strong ties to the desert city. He helped build the luxury Trump International Hotel, where he stays when he visits, and was a frequent visitor during the presidential campaign last year.He lost the state to Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November 2016 presidential election."
678,"Oil prices eased on Wednesday over caution that a price rally that lasted for most of the third quarter would not extend through the last three months of the year.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 were trading at $50.05 per barrel at 0032 GMT, down 37 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close.Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were down 35 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $55.65 a barrel.Traders said the drops came over concerns that a third-quarter market rally that had lifted Brent to mid-2015 highs by late September had been overdone.“Fundamentals may not yet be strong enough to support a continued rally, especially in growth-dependent commodities such as oil,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank in a quarterly outlook to investors.Analysts say that a so-called market rebalancing is now well underway, meaning that demand is no longer undershooting available supply.The re-balancing is a result of strong consumption and also due to efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut output by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and the first quarter of next year.“Compliance with the OPEC production cuts was over 100 percent in August (meaning members produced less than their quotas, on average) and US oil inventories have been declining for several months now,” said William O‘Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities.Preventing prices from climbing further, however, has been rising production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal to cut output.US production C-OUT-T-EIA hit 9.55 million bpd in late September, its highest level since July 2017 and not far off its 9.61 million bpd record from June 2015.“The number of active drilling rigs in the US increased last week, highlighting the fact that higher oil prices will inevitably lead to more production from US shale. These factors have kept WTI oil in a relatively tight trading range for several months now,” O‘Loughlin wrote in a note to clients.Drillers added six oil rigs looking for new production in the week to Sept. 29, bringing the total count up to 750, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes.

As a doctor, of course I want to see him return as slow as possible, only when he is fully fit for the game,” Fu told the South China Morning Post.“There have been many cases of a player returning prematurely with bad consequences.”United manager Jose Mourinho is keen on leaving the 35-year-old striker out of first-team plans until January though he included him in the squad for the Champions League group stage which runs from September to December.“I have no worry about his injury as it always takes time to fully recover,” Fu added.“In fact the EPL (Premier League) has just started and I am sure Manchester United would not need the player urgently for any crucial game either in the league or European competitions.”Ibrahimovic finished as the club’s top scorer last season with 28 goals in 46 appearances."
682,"COX‘S BAZAR: Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh were skeptical on Tuesday about their chances of ever going home to Myanmar, even though the government there has given an assurance it would accept people verified as refugees.More than half a million Rohingya have fled from a Myanmar military crackdown in Rakhine State launched in late August that has been denounced by the United Nations as ethnic cleansing.Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying it is fighting Rohingya terrorists who have claimed attacks on the security forces. The government has said anyone verified as a refugee will be allowed to return under a process set up with Bangladesh in 1993.Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to work on a repatriation plan, and a Myanmar government spokesman confirmed it would go along with it, provided people could verify their status with paperwork.But many refugees in camps in Bangladesh are scornful.“Everything was burned, even people were burned,” said a man who identified himself as Abdullah, dismissing the chances that people would have documents to prove a right to stay in Myanmar.At the root of the problem is the refusal by Buddhist-majority Myanmar to grant citizenship to members of a Muslim minority seen by a mostly unsympathetic, if not hostile, society as interlopers from Bangladesh.Though Myanmar has not granted Rohingya citizenship, under the 1993 procedure, it agreed to take back people who could prove they had been Myanmar residents.But a day after Bangladesh and Myanmar announced apparent progress, a Bangladeshi foreign ministry official appeared resigned to a difficult process.“This is still a long procedure,” said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media.There were already nearly 400,000 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh before the latest exodus, but Myanmar had said it would only accept, “subject to verification”, those who arrived after October 2016, when a military offensive in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks sent 87,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, the Bangladeshi official said.“We said that many Rohingya refugees have no documents, so this process should be flexible. Myanmar said they will decide who will get involved in the verification,” the official said, adding that Bangladesh wanted international agencies to be involved.Myanmar’s government spokesman said under the 1993 pact, even a hospital record was enough to prove residency, but it was only Myanmar, not Bangladesh, that could verify citizenship.“We have a policy for the repatriation process and we will go along with that,” the spokesman, Zaw Htay, told Reuters.But even if refugees have documents, many are wary about returning without an assurance of full citizenship, which they fear could leave them vulnerable to the persecution and curbs they have endured for years.Amina Katu, 60, laughed at the thought of returning.“If we go there, we’ll just have to come back here,” she said. “If they give us our rights, we will go, but people did this before and they had to return.”Last month, Anwar Begum told Reuters she had fled from Myanmar three times. The first time was to escape a 1978 crackdown, and she returned the following year. She fled again in 1991 and returned in 1994.“I don’t want to go back,” the 55-year-old added. “I don’t believe the government. Every time the government agrees we can go back, then we’re there and they break their promise.”Investigators appointed by government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and led by former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan recommended in August that Myanmar review a 1982 law that links citizenship and ethnicity and leaves most Rohingya stateless.UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told a meeting in Geneva on Monday that the link between statelessness and displacement was nowhere more evident than with the Rohingya.“Denial of citizenship is a key aspect of the discrimination and exclusion that have shaped their plight,” he said.Grandi called for a two-track approach to tackle issues of citizenship and rights and inclusive development to stamp out poverty in Rakhine State.Separately, the U.N. refugee agency and Bangladesh authorities are working to contain an outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases in the camps, UNHCR spokesman Andrej Mahecic told a briefing in Geneva.Refugees are still crossing into Bangladesh, though at a slower rate, a spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration said. A Reuters photographer saw smoke plumes on the Myanmar side of the border but it was not clear what was alight.Rights groups say more than half of more than 400 Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine State have been torched.Myanmar officials have said they have attempted to reassure groups of fleeing Rohingya but they could not stop people who were not citizens from leaving."

It even has a name of its own: aptronym.In some cases, it may be rooted in the tradition of a profession determining a family name, such as Baker, Smith or Taylor.Other times, it is a coincidence. But it nearly always raises an eyebrow or even a smile from those realizing the unusual pairing.Recent news stories have mentioned Jack Dagger, the US director of the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame. Then there is Detective Martin Speechley, the ever-quotable spokesman for the New York Police Department.Sometimes the odd connections can be horrifying. When a gunman at a community college in Roseburg, Oregon, killed nine people, including a woman in a wheelchair, her service dog named Bullet survived.But strange synergies also can signal hope. Josh Outman now pitches for Mexico’s Triple-A Minor League Pericos de Puebla but was once with the New York Yankees, Oakland Athletics and other US Major League Baseball teams. Perhaps a streak of no-hitters by Outman could get him back to the big leagues."
684,"LONDON: Former England captain Michael Vaughan has called for a change in the culture of the national team after Ben Stokes´ arrest on a night out.Stokes was arrested in Bristol on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm after getting into a fight in the early hours of last Monday.Video footage allegedly shows the England all-rounder throwing punches and knocking a man to the floor.Stokes, who has not been charged, and other England team-mates were out celebrating a one-day international win over West Indies less than 72 hours before their next game.Vaughan believes that was a poor decision and says England´s management need to address how their players behave.""Yes, he´s 26 years of age, he should be more mature, he has made a massive mistake and I have no sympathy for Ben Stokes whatsoever,"" Vaughan told the BBC on Tuesday.""But the management of the England team have to look at themselves in the mirror and say, ´Hang on a minute, could we have done a bit more, could we have been a bit stricter?´.""I am not saying I want a headmaster and have a curfew and say, ´You have got to be in your room by 11:00 pm and you can never drink´, but there is a time and a place and I just think now, with what has gone on this week, the culture of cricket has to change quickly.""Stokes has been involved in drink-related stories before, having been sent home from a 2013 Lions tour, while it has been reported he was out partying during a Test match at Old Trafford this summer.""A story came out this week that Ben Stokes was out until 3:00 am during a Test match in Manchester,"" Vaughan added.""If I knew it and the media knew it, how come anything wasn´t done to Ben Stokes in the England team.""When we go on tour, we go to Australia, to India, to Bangladesh, there is a huge amount of security, there is no way in a million years an England player is allowed out, they´re allowed to go and party, but there is no way they are allowed out on their own at that time of night."""
685,"ISLAMABAD: The government is approaching the army chief after finding through an administrative inquiry that the Punjab Rangers had taken control of Islamabad accountability court’s premises on Monday without any requisition from the district administration or any other civilian authority.Interior ministry sources told The News on Tuesday that a dossier on the incident was being sent to Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa. He said that an explanation was also being sought from the DG Punjab Rangers.The inquiry report on the incident was submitted to the interior minister last night. The report confirms that the Punjab Rangers had acted unlawfully without any permission from any civilian authority.Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal was barred from entering the courts complex during Nawaz' Sharif's hearing It is not yet known, however, as to who had tasked the Rangers to take control of the Islamabad accountability court on Monday. According to sources, the government expects from the army chief to take notice of this incident and initiate action against those who had acted unlawfully causing embarrassment to both the civilian government as well as the defence institution.These sources added that the government, while expecting action from the army chief to proceed against those responsible for the Monday’s incident, desires to address the issue in a manner that it does not fuel civil-military confrontation.The Rangers illegally controlled the accountability court’s premises and even blocked the entry of those including mediamen who were duly permitted. This unauthorised use of the Rangers had virtually turned the accountability court trial into an in-camera. Observers and critics noted that even during the martial laws, open trials were held.The embarrassing situation caused by the Rangers led to the interior minister’s outburst who said that Pakistan was not a banana republic but a democratic, constitutional country, and asked the Islamabad administration to give him in writing how the Rangers took over.“I will step down if the rule didn’t become clear about what the writ of the state and the civil administration is. Whose orders the paramilitary force was following when the interior ministry did not issue any such direction that it was enforcing. There will be one law here and one government and two states cannot function within one state,” the minister commented.When the interior minister during his visit of the accountability court had called the Rangers commander to explain what the force was doing and on whose orders, the official reportedly disappeared from the scene.After the hearing of the case, the judge of the accountability court was quoted by the electronic media as having said that he had not called the Rangers. However, later in his order issued, the judge wrote that the Rangers were deployed for security purposes. While the government was raising hue and cry over the Rangers taking control of the premises, the accountability judge in his order said: “Deployment of Rangers was highly appreciable action of the government.”Originally published in The News"
686,"WASHINGTON: US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday the United States would try “one more time” to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan before President Donald Trump would turn to options to address.Relations between the two countries have been frayed over the past decade. “We need to try one more time to make this strategy work with them, by, with and through the Pakistanis, and if our best efforts fail, the president is prepared to take whatever steps are necessary,” Mattis said at a House Armed Services Committee hearing.Mattis added that he would be travelling to Islamabad soon, but did not give more details.Possible Trump administration responses being discussed include expanding US drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan’s status as a major non-NATO ally.When asked by a lawmaker whether revoking of Pakistan’s major non-NATO ally was amongst the options being considered to deal with Islamabad, Mattis said: “I am sure it will be.”Pakistan argues that it has done a great deal to help the United States in tracking down terrorists and points out that it has suffered hundreds of deaths in militant attacks in response to its crackdowns.US officials have told Reuters that the United States will send about 3,500 additional troops to Afghanistan.Dunford said that the current cost for the United States in Afghanistan was about $12.5 billion a year, and the new strategy would cost an additional $1.1 billion."

688,"Sydney and Melbourne could regularly face 50 degree Celsius (122F) days within 25 years even if Australia meets its Paris global warming targets, a new study warned Wednesday.Other areas across the country should also prepare for extreme heat, said the research led by the Australian National University (ANU) and supported by the Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science, an international consortium.The study assessed the potential magnitude of future extreme temperatures under the 196-nation Paris Agreement, which targets curbing increases in global temperatures to between 1.5C and 2.0C above pre-industrial levels.""Major Australian cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne, may experience unprecedented temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius under 2.0 degrees of global warming,"" said lead author and ANU climate scientist Sophie Lewis, adding it could occur by the 2040s.""The increase in Australian summer temperatures indicates that other major cities should also be prepared for unprecedented future extreme heat.""The study's climate modelling projected daily temperatures of up to 3.8C above existing records in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, despite efforts to curb warming.In ratifying the Paris agreement last year, Australia set an ambitious target to reduce emissions to 26 to 28 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.This would represent a 50–52 per cent reduction in emissions per capita between 2005 and 2030.With its heavy use of coal-fired power and relatively small population of 24 million, Australia is considered one of the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters.Lewis said dealing with such heat in cities would need proper planning, with hospitals better equipped to cope with more admissions.Australia has just experienced its hottest winter on record amid a long-term warming trend largely attributed to climate change.Maximum daytime temperatures were 1.9C above the long-term national average of 21.8C during the June-August season, the Bureau of Meteorology said last month.Data from the weather bureau and national science body CSIRO shows Australia has warmed by approximately 1.0C since 1910.More recently, over 200 weather records were broken during the last summer, with intense heatwaves, bushfires and flooding plaguing the December 2016-February 2017 season.The study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, said only immediate climate action internationally could prevent record extreme seasons year after year.""One of the hottest years on record globally in 2015 could be an average year by 2025,"" said Lewis.Fellow researcher Andrew King, from the University of Melbourne, said the study team used a combination of observations and modelling to assess how the magnitude of record-breaking events may change in the future.""Previous scientific studies have focused on how current temperature extremes have been impacted by climate change, or on how the frequency of these current extremes will change in the future,"" said King.""This study takes a different approach and examines how the severity of future temperature extremes might change in the future."""

690,"SINGAPORE: Oil prices eased on Wednesday, with US. crude dipping below $50 per barrel, pulled down by caution that a rally that lasted for most of the third quarter would not extend through the last three months of the year.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 were trading at $50 per barrel at 0417 GMT, down 42 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last close. They fell below $50 per barrel earlier in the session.Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were down 38 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $55.62 a barrel.Traders said the drops came over concerns that a third-quarter market rally that had lifted Brent to mid-2015 highs by late September had been overdone.“Fundamentals may not yet be strong enough to support a continued rally, especially in growth-dependent commodities such as oil,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank in a quarterly outlook to investors.Analysts say that a so-called market rebalancing is now well underway, meaning that demand is no longer undershooting available supply.The re-balancing is a result of strong consumption and also due to efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut output by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 and the first quarter of next year.“Compliance with the OPEC production cuts was over 100 percent in August (meaning members produced less than their quotas, on average) and U.S. oil inventories have been declining for several months now,” said William O‘Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities.But rising production in the United States, which is not participating in the deal to cut output, has prevented prices from climbing further.U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA hit 9.55 million bpd in late September, its highest level since July 2017 and not far off its 9.61 million bpd record from June 2015.“The number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. increased last week, highlighting the fact that higher oil prices will inevitably lead to more production from U.S. shale. These factors have kept WTI oil in a relatively tight trading range for several months now,” O‘Loughlin wrote in a note to clients.Drillers added six oil rigs looking for new production in the week to Sept. 29, bringing the total count up to 750, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes.Due largely to rising U.S. output, Saxo Bank’s Hansen said that “an extension of output curbs beyond March (2018) will be needed to ensure continued support for the oil market”."

693,"LONDON: The British government has announced a ban on sale of acids, sharp razor, knives and other corrosive substances to under-18s in the country.Home Secretary Amber Rudd's pledge, at the Conservative Party's annual meeting in Manchester, comes as more than 400 attacks using corrosive substances were recorded in the six months to April.She termed the increasing acid and knives attacks as a string of revolting attacks and told the party that sale of such material would be drastically limited.The government said new laws to target people caught carrying acid would be modeled on current legislation around knife carrying, which carries a maximum of four years in prison, a fine, or both.Speaking at the conference in Manchester, the Home Secretary said that acid attacks were absolutely revolting, adding: ""I am also announcing a new offense to prevent the sale of acids to under 18s"".She told the conference that there had been ""an exponential surge in the volume of child sexual abuse referrals"", as she unveiled a GBP600,000 investment in new software that trawls the web for images of child sexual abuse.“Major investment [will be made] in new technology that will track down indecent images of children online and remove them at an unprecedented rate”, she added.Rudd called on internet firms and social media platforms to ""act now"" and remove extremist content online.""This is how we will help make our communities safer as crime changes,"" Rudd said.She said the technology will get the images taken down at an unprecedented rate. ""Our investment will also enable internet companies to pro-actively search for, and destroy, illegal images in their systems.""She also told party activists that security services had foiled seven “new consultation on offensive weapons, which will be published in the autumn”.New measures could include stopping the sale of knives online to someone under the age of 18, making it illegal to keep certain types of weapons - such as flick, knives and zombie knives - at home, she said.She further said that extending the jail sentence for those viewing extremist content online would close an important gap in the legislation, with tougher sentences only applying now if people have downloaded or stored the material. “Anyone publishing information about the police or armed forces for the purposes of terrorism could now face up to 15 years in prison.""Rudd called on Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft to ""honour [their] moral obligations"" and build on their progress in countering terrorism online.""I call on you with urgency, to bring forward technology solutions to rid your platforms of this vile terrorist material that plays such a key role in radicalization,"" she said.The Home Secretary also challenged detractors of the Prevent programmed to work with the Government, saying it was not ""some Big Brother monolithic beast"".On immigration, Rudd said there would be no cliff edge for businesses when a new system is brought in after Brexit. ""I'm committed to working with businesses, both large and small, to make sure we don't impose unnecessary burdens, or create damaging labour shortages,"" she said.The number of crimes using acid or other “noxious substances” has more than doubled in London over the last three years, according to official data.

696,"ROME: The highest level of Rome´s ancient Colosseum will be opened to the public for the first time in 40 years on November 1, Italy´s culture minister said Tuesday.Seats on the fifth level of the amphitheatre were once reserved for ancient Roman society´s lowest commoner: the plebeian.But the seats boasted a breathtaking view -- not only of the gladiator battles far below but of the heart of the empire.""It is an incredible view of the Colosseum and Rome, which the visitor will remember as one of the most beautiful things he has seen in his life,"" Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said at a media presentation on Tuesday.Far below, tourists peering down into the maze of galleries in the monument´s belly appear as tiny specks, showing just how far away the commoners were from the arena floor, where terrified prisoners were forced to fight wild beasts.Those squeezed together on wooden benches had a long way to climb to get to their seats -- but the tickets were free. Once they were there spectators were protected by a large canvas from sudden downpours.Visitors will have to book guided tours, which will take groups of a maximum of 25 people up to the gods level at a time.They will start with an exceptionally well-preserved corridor between the second and third floors, where traces of the lavatories can still be seen, the Colosseum´s director Rossella Rea said.There is also evidence of restorations to the walls following a fire sparked by lightning in 217 AD.The tour will continue to the third floor, where the middle-classes sat, and on to the fourth, where merchants and traders enjoyed the famously grisly shows.The first level, in blood-splattering distance to the action, was reserved for the emperor and his senators.Completed in 80 AD, the Colosseum was the biggest amphitheatre built during the Roman empire.Standing 48.5 metres (159 feet) high, it was capable of hosting 80,000 spectators for feasts of entertainment that encapsulated the brutality, hedonism and engineering genius that were among the defining features of ancient Rome.The first phase of a major makeover of the venue was completed in July 2016, with a number of sections structurally strengthened and most of the remaining walls water-sprayed to remove centuries of encrusted dirt and grime."

He continues to dominate Pakistani politics.”Reacting to opponents’ criticism of the Elections Bill 2017, which paved way for Nawaz to regain the chairmanship of PML-N, she remarked that people worried about Nawaz becoming the head of the party have no relation to PML-N.Maryam said “it has been proven today that the party is standing with Nawaz. Those opposing Nawaz are helpless against his supporters.”She also said that a democratic constitution was turned into a dictatorial constitution just to remove Nawaz. “Those bothered about PML-N’s internal politics should focus on their own parties,” she said, adding that their political opponents should work on making their party that of the people.Referring to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairperson Imran Khan disqualification case in the Supreme Court, she asked “If it is not a crime to not declare 6.5 percent of the money trail, then why wasn't an average taken out of the AED10,000, which were not shown as part of Nawaz Sharif's assets?”Earlier in the day, the PML-N re-elected former prime minister Nawaz Sharif as the party's president for a period of four years.The formal announcement was made at the party's general council meeting at Convention Centre, Islamabad by the PML-N's chief election commissioner Chaudhry Jaffar Iqbal.The PML-N leader was elected unopposed during the meeting of party's general councilNawaz has been elected unopposed as no one else contested against him.Earlier, during the intra-party election, Nawaz's nomination papers were submitted by State Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry.Senior PML-N leaders, including Nawaz, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif were present at the event. "
700,"PARIS: The detection of gravitational waves, remnants of galactic cataclysms that occurred billions of years ago, opened a window on the origins of the universe.Here´s why their discovery earned three US astrophysicists a Nobel Physics Prize on Tuesday:Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by massive astrophysical events, as when two black holes crash into each other and merge.Albert Einstein first theorised their existence over 100 years ago, and their detection in 2015 finally confirmed a key element of his world-changing general theory of relativity, which describes the force of gravity.The discovery of the waves was also a big deal because they allow astronomers, largely limited to what they can see, to witness things telescopes cannot detect.With their mere existence, gravitational waves provide evidence of historical galactic events such as star implosions.""Normally when we try to understand what is going on we only see the bits of the universe that happen to emit light,"" Chris Lintott, a professor of astrophysics at Oxford University, told AFP.""We have this horrible bias when we look at the universe in that we get distracted by shiny things.""But with Einstein´s waves, scientists have found a new way to pry into the universe´s oldest secrets. They have created an ultra-sensitive device which uses a laser beam and mirrors to detect the ripples.""We have a window back in time, it won´t get us all the way back to the Big Bang, but it may get us very close to it,"" said Jon Butterworth, a professor of physics at University College London.""Light does get us a long way (back in history), but for very big objects, this (the waves) might get us further back.""One of the challenges in proving Einstein right was designing equipment sensitive enough to detect gravitational waves.Humans have certainly come into contact with the ripples before, but without knowing it.""We are being stretched and squashed by gravitational waves but to be honest the scale is just ridiculously tiny,"" Carolin Crawford, an astronomer at Cambridge University, told AFP. ""We would never feel it.""Gravitational waves are minuscule and near-undetectable because they interact very weakly with matter and travel through the universe at the speed of light unimpeded.""For many years in the 30 or more year history of the LIGO project... it was not anything anyone in the mainstream cared about,"" said Lintott, using the acronym for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, which spotted the waves.""This was almost (like) Don Quixote, I think a large number of people were sceptical that you´d ever build an experiment sensitive enough,"" he said, referring to the famous novel about pursuing lofty ideals.Today, there are three wave detectors in operation, opening all sorts of new possibilities.""The key thing with that is you start being able to see where they (the waves) are coming from,"" Butterworth said.""The more detectors you have you can start triangulating where the wave came from.

Sparingly deployed on the diagonal or in a whole flotilla of volant skirts and dresses, frills are back as a major trend for next spring and summer.Once a symbol of frivolous, even enslaved, femininity, they have been reinterpreted by the likes of Stella McCartney and Clare Waight Keller at Givenchy as symbols of power and confidence.While they have been creeping back out of the cupboard for a while, frills ruffled through almost every show this past week, from the punky glamour of Alexander McQueen to the slick styling of Giambattista Valli, as at edgy Sacai and avant-garde Comme des Garcons.Black and white isn't so much a trend for next spring and summer as the rule.Although pastels and strong colours traditionally dominate the spring/summer collections, this year many brands have not looked much beyond the two-tone essentials of black and white.The list of those who have gone binary is long: sexy Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Off-White, Balmain, Mugler, Lanvin, Isabel Marant, Ann Demeulemeester, Paco Rabanne and Yohji Yamamoto...Silvery greys are also in, with Nina Ricci, Paco Rabanne and Vanessa Seward using them to great effect.Oversize is over, cut down to size by a sharp return to tailoring.For the last two years the catwalks have been awash with sulking teenagers hiding in their hoodies.But with the enormous coats and trailing-trousers look now filtering down to the high street, fashion is off again in another direction.Paris Fashion Week has been remarkable for bringing clothes back to the body, with a much closer cut to shake off the studied shapelessness of the last few seasons.With Rick Owens, the Los Angeles maverick who took oversize to extremes, cutting his cloth much tighter, only Celine held to thinking big.Even Virgil Abloh, the en vogue American designer at Off-White so beloved by rap stars, has embraced the well-cut power suit, sending out Naomi Campbell in a double-breasted white jacket with cycling shorts.Cycling shorts are another mini-trend, with Saint Laurent, Chloe and Y/Project joining the peloton of houses highlighting a look apparently pioneered by Kim Kardashian.With Lacoste quitting New York for the Paris catwalk, there is no holding sportswear's onward march.But when the smart French label Koche sent out a series of re-imagined Paris Saint-Germain tops, it seemed like fashion had finally surrendered to the football shirt-wearing masses.Despite the pearls and the exquisite detailing, there was still something of a sharp intake of breath -- was a style Rubicon being crossed here?Christelle Kocher, the Koche designer who also heads up Lemarie, which specialises in feathers and other haute couture fripperies, managed to stay just about onside by successfully feminising a garment with such a pungent whiff of maleness.Yet it was another item from the male locker that really got designers' juices going, as Lacoste turned its emblematic polo shirts into trailing and asymmetric dresses, with the neck pulled over to play up a bare shoulder.The highly influential Celine and Atlein also did some clever things with the polo, as did Carven, while Glenn Martens at Y/Project pulled Bermuda shorts way upmarket.Summer wouldn't be summer without print dresses and skirts. This year, however, they are particularly easy on the eye.One expects nothing less than the sublime from the prince of prints Dries Van Noten, and the Flemish master did not disappoint. But Akris, the biggest Swiss brand you've never heard of, won still more hearts with theirs.But it was Liselore Frowijn's futuristic visions of African wax prints, Junya Watanabe's punky take on Marimekko textiles and Comme des Garcons' Arcimboldo dress which printed themselves on the memory.Among the ingenious oddities of the week were Balenciaga and Chanel's handbag overcoats, little poncho parachutes to protect purses that can cost the price of a secondhand car.Both brands also attempted the seemingly impossible, trying to make Crocs sandals (Balenciaga) and plastic see-through macs (Chanel) objects of desire. History will decide."
702,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will introduce a new cricket format when big hitters Shahid Afridi, India's Virender Singh, Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara and England's Eoin Morgan feature in a T10 league in December.The 10-over-a-side matches will spread over 90 minutes in Sharjah, the details of which were announced here on Tuesday.T20 cricket was introduced in England in 2003 while the first international T20 match was held between Australia and New Zealand at Auckland in February 2005.Since then the shortest format — the other two are five-day Tests and 50-over internationals — has become the most popular amongst the fans around the world.The league's president Salman Iqbal hoped the idea will kick off.""Everyone has played T-10 cricket on the streets and this will give more fire to cricket and will be a big step forward and people will definitely enjoy it,"" said Iqbal.The tournament will be as swift as the format, lasting just four days from 21-24 December with former Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan also featuring.Afridi, who retired from international cricket last year said he was thrilled at the idea.""When I was told of the idea I was thrilled and requested that I want to play,"" said Afridi, famous as Boom Boom for his big hitting.England's current one-day and T20 captain Morgan was confident that T10 cricket will have an impact.""The whole concept is exciting,"" said Morgan. ""We all remember when the first time Twenty20 cricket was played and since then it (twenty20) has impacted the other formats.""If this new idea takes off then I am sure it will also impact the other forms of the game.""The four teams will be selected through drafts later this month.Misbah said the new formats will be easy for ageing players as well.""It's an exciting idea and a good thing for players like me,"" said 43-year-old Misbah who retired in May this year. ""It will need just ten overs of batting and then fielding and at this age, I can afford that."""
703,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister and senior leader of Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday said that our nation is faced with ‘abnormal circumstances’ which call for the ‘house to be set in order.’Asif said that countries shouldn’t put pressure on countries they share a close relationship withForeign Minister Khawaja Asif, in a remark on September 5, had said that the country needs to put the house in order, which was later endorsed by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi but was severely criticised by former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, who said that government officials should refrain from issuing statements that reinforce the enemy's narrative and embarrass Pakistan in front of the international community.“Nations that are alive regularly conduct exercises of self-accountability, and [our self-analysis] only points out how every religious event has become a security nightmare instead of a symbol of peace,” Iqbal said. “Don’t we then need to set our house in order?”Speaking on Geo News’ programme Capital Talk, the interior minister criticised the country’s political situation.Our seventy-year-old history has repeated time and again, Iqbal said, adding that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification was similar to the dismissal of former prime minister (late) Mohammad Khan Junejo, who was dismissed by former president and martial law administrator Zia-ul-Haq, on charges of incompetency and economic stagflation.“We are a nation faced with abnormal circumstances,” Iqbal said in response to a question on his earlier statement where he had asked, “when will Pakistan become a normal nation.”The minister insisted that the effects of political instability were far-reaching and harmful for the country.“A Chinese investor, who was all set to invest in Pakistan, is now reassessing the decision after the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz Sharif” he said, adding that foreign investors have become wary of making investments in the country, which are directly linked with the country’s economic growth, because of an unstable democratic framework.In response to a question if the PML-N, by bulldozing the Elections Bill (now Act) 2017 in the parliament, had established a “state within the state” – a phrase recently used by the interior minister after Rangers surrounded an accountability court before the former premier’s hearing – Iqbal responded that the party had only removed a ‘black law’ introduced by field marshal Ayub Khan in 1962.“Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto did away with the clause that prevented an individual, declared ineligible from holding public office, to head a political party,” he said. “From 1975 till 2002, the new legislation remained but General (r) Musharraf, in an attempt to paralyze the PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), amended the law through the Political Parties Ordinance.”The minister lamented that this amendment was proposed and approved at the behest and for the benefit of one person – former president Musharraf.Lashing out at the opposition party PPP, Iqbal expressed his surprise at the party’s objection to a legislation created by its own founder (Bhutto).Interior and development minister was addressing the PML-N general council meeting on TuesdayIn response to a question about proposing an amendment to Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, which dictates that a person cannot be qualified as member of the national or provincial legislatures, if they are not Sadiq and Ameen (truthful and trustworthy), Iqbal said that while the PML-N does not want to make the parliament ‘free-for-all’, it has reservations on the gauge that sets the Holy Prophet as the benchmark of qualification.“We don’t want to open the way for criminals, yet it is also true that only the Prophet (PBUH) was Sadiq and Ameen and we can’t measure up to that criteria,” Iqbal said, adding that the party doesn’t have the required two-thirds majority to amend the clause. The interior minister, in reference to the July 28 decision of the Supreme Court to disqualify former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, said the decision has been referred to as a “setback for democracy.”“The decision has shamed our country, and so the house [definitely] needs to be set in order,” he said, expressing his dissatisfaction at Nawaz not been given the right to a single appeal. “Even the naib-qasid (peon) in my ministry has three rights to appeal...so how can the elected prime minister not be given the right to [even] a single appeal.” When asked why Nawaz or other PML-N leaders mentioned an incident from yesterday, when rangers blocked entry to the court where the hearing of the former premier was underway, Iqbal said that the administrative report for the incident is now complete and it is a matter of concern for the military leadership.Deputy commissioner acknowledges receipt of letter from SSP Operations, but says no action was taken after discussion“We will share the administrative inquiry with the army leadership and ask the DG Rangers to explain [the incident],” the minister said, adding that the DG Rangers had earlier given him a vague response the former held a press conference to denounce the deployment of the paramilitary force without approval from the interior ministry.“DG Rangers mentioned a security threat but his response was evasive,” Iqbal said. “But security agencies denied any involvement in the matter.”The minister highlighted the importance of the issue, adding that he understands that the military leadership wants the constitution to prevail but those “trying to create a rift between the army leadership and civilian administration” should be identified. Iqbal expressed his confidence in the Supreme Court’s ‘wisdom’ in response to a question about the apex court’s power of conducting a judicial review of any amendments to the constitution.“We have only restored a former law [through approval of the Elections Act 2017] but some people want to drag the Supreme Court into this matter,” he said. “But I am hopeful that the court is wise enough to refrain from becoming an associate of the PTI and Sheikh Rashid.” "
704,"WASHINGTON: US online giants acknowledged Tuesday they failed to prevent rumours and misinformation from being circulated during and after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas.Facebook, Google and Twitter said they were working on fixes after learning of fake news ending up in feeds and searches following the shooting that killed 59 and injured over 500 people.Some rumours identified the wrong person as the shooter, others named a search for a female person of interest described as a ""Trump-hating Rachel Maddow fan,"" referring to an MSNBC host who is a fierce critic of President Donald Trump.After news outlets pointed out false reports from the 4chan message board were appearing at the top of Google search results, the internet giant said it acted to correct the problem.""Within hours, the 4chan story was algorithmically replaced by relevant results,"" Google said in an email to AFP.""This should not have appeared for any queries, and we´ll continue to make improvements to prevent this from happening in the future.""Facebook said it discovered a false news story on the shooting and acted to remove it.""However, its removal was delayed by a few minutes, allowing it to be screen captured and circulated online,"" Facebook said.""We are working to fix the issue that allowed this to happen in the first place and deeply regret the confusion this caused.""Twitter said it too was stepping up efforts to weed out false reports on the shooting.""We are aware of this issue and are proactively taking action on content that violates our terms of service,"" a Twitter spokesman said.The online giants have faced increasing pressure to prevent manipulation of their platforms after revelations of Russian-led efforts to spread misinformation ahead of the 2016 US election.In Las Vegas, Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old gambler and retired accountant, was identified as the shooter who fired on a huge crowd at an outdoor country music concert before killing himself.Investigators are trying to establish a motive for the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history, but so far have been unable to pin down what drove Paddock to shoot into the crowds from a 32nd floor hotel room."
705,"JERUSALEM: The Israeli army on Tuesday announced it was closing crossing points from the Palestinian territories for 11 days due to security concerns during the upcoming Jewish festival of Sukkot.The closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a frequent measure for major Jewish holidays, would run from midnight Tuesday (2100 GMT), with only emergency cases allowed through, the army said.The annual Sukkot festival — which lasts one week — commemorates the Jewish journey through the Sinai after their exodus from Egypt.The holiday will see thousands of worshippers head to the Wailing Wall in the Old City of Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites for Jews, to pray.The location is close to Islam´s third holiest site, the Haram al-Sharif compound, known to the Jews as the Temple Mount, which was the focus of angry protests in July after Israeli forces limited access over the killing of two police officers. "
706,"TOKYO:  Companies in Japan’s service industries are struggling to hire and retain staff as the labour market becomes the tightest in decades, and are increasingly taking unorthodox steps to alleviate the shortage.That can include looking to housewives and the retired to come into or rejoin the labour force. In some cases, it means offering better working conditions for some staff, even if this requires raising prices. In others, companies are reducing the services they offer, perhaps by cutting opening hours, or delaying expansion plans.Japan’s jobless rate stood at a 23-year low of 2.8 percent in August, reflecting a strengthening economy and shrinking working-age population in a rapidly ageing society.And on Monday, the Bank of Japan’s “tankan” quarterly survey showed that the ratio of companies complaining of labour shortages, rather than excess staff, was at its highest level since 1992.The labour squeeze can reduce the speed of economic development, and even curb some economic activity altogether, hurting Japan’s chances of a period of sustainable growth.For example, at Sun Mall in Chiba, east of Tokyo, labor shortages have led some tenants to abandon plans to take up space at the site, and others to shut up shop when key workers could not be replaced, according to Seth Sulkin, president and CEO of the mall’s owner Pacifica Capital KK. He also said a new spa due to open there in a few months has been forced to push back the opening date due to staff shortages.“The pool of people seeking part-time jobs is shrinking rapidly, particularly outside of central Tokyo,” Sulkin said. “We’ve recommended that the tenants convert some of the positions to full-time and raise wages but they tell us they can't-do that and still make money,” he said.“In Tokyo, it’s easier to hire people but it’s not as easy as it used to be,” he said. By contrast, “in our Chiba mall, I think the location is the big issue, there’s just not enough people.”With the economy at near full-employment, companies are being forced to try to find new sources of labour.Fast food chain McDonald’s Holdings Co Japan Ltd, following in the footsteps of convenience store operator FamilyMart UNY Holdings, says it will try to expand its core workforce beyond young people by targeting housewives for part-time positions.More than half of housewives with children would like to work but are not able to find a suitable job, a survey of more than 4,000 married mothers by the Jobs Research Centre found. They were particularly concerned about long working days that don’t fit with their responsibilities at home.Signs of companies moving to improve working conditions to retain and attract staff include Doutor Nichires Holdings Co Ltd, which has introduced severance pay for some temporary employees at its Doutor Coffee chain. That is an unusual move in a country where there is a large gap in pay and working conditions between temporary and permanent employees.Some restaurant operators, including Royal Holdings Co Ltd and McDonald’s Japan, have begun moving away from 24-hour operations, but that is far from the preferred option for companies in an industry that prides itself on offering convenience and service at all hours of the day.More than 80% of companies surveyed in a Reuters poll in June reported that they expected labour shortages would force them to restrict the number of services they can offer over the next several years.Some efforts to expand the labour force are finding corporate thinking has only changed so much.This March, human resources firm Fullcast Holdings Co Ltd set up a recruitment agency aimed at Japan’s over 60s and, while almost 2,000 retirees have registered, many companies are not able to accommodate them, says Fullcast Senior Works President Yasuhiro Sumi.“If there were jobs that met their needs in terms of things like distance from home, job type and working hours there are lots of employable people,” he said.Many companies remain hesitant to spend their record cash piles on raising wages, in part because they are unable to pass on costs to their customers who are accustomed to nearly two decades of mostly falling prices.“It seems that deepening labour shortages are not resulting in higher prices that reflect rises in wage and labour costs,” says Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute."
707,"Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani has played down his penalty-taking spat with Paris Saint-Germain team-mate Neymar.Cavani and Brazilian Neymar, the world's most expensive player, reportedly fell out over penalty-taking duties for PSG in recent league matches.The despite blew up a couple of weeks ago when Cavani, PSG's regular penalty-taker, refused to let Neymar take a spot-kick against Lyon, only to then miss.But then at the weekend, and after rumours Cavani had been offered a million euros to cede penalty duties to his higher-profile team-mate, Neymar took, and scored, a spot-kick against Bordeaux.""These things happen in football. These are things that are sometimes blown up,"" Cavani, speaking to reporters in Caracas ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Venezuela on Thursday, said on Monday.""We all know that they become bigger than they are. They are sorted out in the dressing room. Every (problem) has a solution. It's calmed down.""Despite giving up spot-kick duties, which Cavani took over when Zlatan Ibrahimovic left PSG a year and a half ago, the Uruguayan has still outscored his Brazilian team-mate eight goals to six in France's Ligue 1."
708,"MADRID: Thiago Alcantara was saddened by Spain fans abusing Gerard Pique at an open training session on Monday night, but said the Barcelona defender was unaffected by the incident.Pique voted in the illegal independence referendum in Catalonia and criticised the Spanish government for trying to shut it down violently, angering some Spain fans.A large group of supporters jeered and insulted the Catalan centre back during a short training session at Las Rozas on Monday.“When I’ve come (to the Spain camp) Pique has always had the same attitude, commitment and happiness,” Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago told reporters on Tuesday.“(The situation) saddens us because we come here to talk about football, I‘m not here to talk about the life of anybody. It saddens me not to be able to be comfortable and talk about Albania (whom Spain play on Oct. 6 in Alicante).”Thiago backed Pique to overcome any abuse from Spain supporters during the game.“Pique’s already played at the Santiago Bernabeu many times. He’s used to hostile environments. He has the same attitude as always,” added Thiago, who played with Pique at Barcelona until 2013.“I’ve enjoyed watching him as a player and having him as a team mate and I love to be able to keep doing so.”Spain, Group G leaders, are bidding to seal a place at next year’s World Cup in final qualifiers against Albania on Friday in Alicante and Israel in Jerusalem three days later.Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke wants to put the issue to one side and focus on confirming Spain’s presence in Russia.“We always feel the support of the fans. Alicante loves the national team a lot and I‘m sure we will feel their affection,” he said.“The atmosphere in the dressing-room has not changed. We are focused on winning and reaching the World Cup. We’re studying our opponents, it won’t be easy to win but we can almost seal qualification (against Albania).”"
709,"WASHINGTON: A 2013 hack affected all three billion accounts at Yahoo, the online giant´s parent company said Tuesday following a new analysis of the incident.The disclosure from Verizon, which acquired Yahoo´s online assets earlier this year, revised sharply upward the initial estimate of one billion accounts affected.The statement said that the estimate is based on ""new intelligence"" following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts into the incident in August 2013.""While this is not a new security issue, Yahoo is sending email notifications to the additional affected user accounts,"" said a statement issued by Verizon´s internet unit known as Oath.""The investigation indicates that the user account information that was stolen did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. The company is continuing to work closely with law enforcement.""The Yahoo breach was already believed to be the largest ever in terms of numbers of users affected. But a recently disclosed breach by credit agency Equifax is seen as potentially more damaging because of the sensitivity of the data leaked.Yahoo, which was once one of the leading internet firms, sold its main online operations to Verizon in a deal that closed in June for $4.48 billion.The purchase price was cut following revelations of two major data breaches at Yahoo.In addition to the 2013 breach, Yahoo said that hackers in 2014 stole personal data from more than 500 million of its user accounts.The US Justice Department charged two Russian intelligence operatives and a pair of hackers over one of the attacks, which had apparent twin goals of espionage and financial gain.Canadian authorities this year arrested Karim Baratov, 22, an immigrant from Kazakhstan, on a US warrant.US authorities allege Russian intelligence agents hired Baratov and another hacker to carry out attacks on Yahoo from 2014 to 2016."
710,"Meditation may help reduce the risk of heart disease when it’s added to proven approaches like lifestyle changes or drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, US doctors say.In its first guidelines dedicated to meditation, the American Heart Association (AHA) stresses that the benefits haven’t been clearly established because studies have generally been too small, brief or poorly designed to draw broad conclusions. But the AHA research review concludes that meditation may have some benefits beyond just reducing stress, said Dr Glenn Levine, chair of the AHA task force on clinical practice guidelines.“Meditation can be considered as an adjunctive lifestyle intervention in those interested in this practice,” Levine, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said by email. “We do not believe meditation should be undertaken as a substitute for well-established and recommended lifestyle and medicinal interventions.”The practice of meditation dates back as far as 5000 BC. While meditation is associated with certain philosophies and religions, today it’s practised by people from many walks of life as a way to improve focus and relaxation, Levine and colleagues note in the Journal of the American Heart Association.The guidelines don’t address mind-body practices such as yoga and Tai Chi because the physical activity in these pursuits has been proven to help lower the risk of heart disease.Instead, the AHA focused on sitting meditation, including a variety of common forms such as: Samatha; Vipassana (Insight Meditation); Mindful Meditation; Zen Meditation (Zazen); Raja Yoga; Loving-Kindness (Metta); Transcendental Meditation; and Relaxation Response.Among other things, these inactive forms of meditation may be associated with decreased levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and improved sleep and overall wellbeing, the AHA guidelines note.Meditation might also help lower blood pressure, but there isn’t enough evidence yet to show whether or how much blood pressure might decline for individuals.Some studies have also suggested that meditation might help people quit smoking, the guidelines conclude.Meditation may help lower the risk of heart disease by countering the impact of stress on the body, said Dr James Stahl, a researcher at the Geisel Medical School at Dartmouth College and at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.When people are under stress, their fight or flight response can kick in, leading to a release of stress hormones as well as spikes in blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen consumption and a release of inflammatory chemicals in the body, Stahl, who wasn’t involved in the guidelines, said by email.“This is perfectly appropriate when confronted by a tiger but not so much if ordinary things like traffic trigger this response,” Stahl said.Meditation can trigger the opposite of a fight or flight response, encouraging the body to slow down and improving risk factors for heart disease like metabolic problems or inflammation.Some patients may even be able to try meditation along with diet and lifestyle changes before they move on to drugs, Stahl said. Meditation will work best, however, if people practice with the help of a trained professional.With regular practice, meditation may also help improve quality of life, especially emotional and spiritual aspects, said Bei-Hung Chang, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester who wasn’t involved in the guidelines.“Meditation generally has low risks, and low costs,” Chang said by email. “Once learned, the technique can be practiced anytime and in any place, and integrated into one’s way of life.”"
711,"GENEVA: Pakistan's permanent representative to the United Nations, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi said on Tuesday that Pakistan would effectively respond to any Indian aggression after repeated threats to carry out surgical strikes by the country’s eastern neighbor.“All I can say to them is: do not underestimate Pakistan's resolve and capacity to defend itself.""""Any aggression or intervention will meet a matching and effective response from our armed forces and the people of Pakistan,"" added Lodhi while participating in a debate on the annual report of UN Secretary-General on the work of the organisation.""India claims, falsely, to have conducted a so-called 'surgical strike' across the Line of Control. This claim, and India's repeated threats to conduct such 'strikes' across the LOC, constitute flagrant violations of the UN Charter's injunction against the use or threat of use of force,""She further said that this provides Pakistan sufficient reason to respond in an exercise of its right to self-defence.She also questioned if Indian leaders were trying to provoke a conflict with Pakistan by making such false claims and blatant threats.She also urged the world body to take “urgent” action to prevail on India to control its threatening behaviour.Lodhi added that India has resorted to daily violations of the ceasefire agreement along the Line of Control (LoC) to divert international attention from its atrocities in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK).Describing the continuing Indian occupation of Jammu and Kashmir as a travesty of justice, law and morality, the Pakistani envoy said the people of Indian occupied Kashmir still awaited the implementation of numerous Security Council resolutions, adopted some 70 years ago, that promised them their inalienable right to self-determination.India has used brutal and indiscriminate force to suppress the heroic indigenous freedom movement against the occupation, she said, noting that hundreds of innocent, unarmed Kashmiris had been martyred in the recent wave of protests; countless others have been blinded and maimed by pellet guns, in what had widely been described as the first ""mass blinding"" in human history.Indian atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir, she said, were well-documented by international human rights organisations, but India defended them.""It does not express remorse for the acts of the perpetrators of these war crimes. It rewards them with national honours.,"" said Ambassador Lodhi""Yet, these universal ideals are being violated, in plain sight of the international community, in Palestine, in Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir, and elsewhere.”""The only terrorism in Kashmir is India's state terrorism,"" she said.Pakistan, said Lodhi, had been on the frontlines in the fight against terrorism, with its military campaign, involving over 200,000 troops, having crushed and eliminated terrorist groups in the country's frontier regions and its towns and cities.“Despite paying a heavy price Pakistan would continue this fight until its objectives were achieved.”The Pakistani envoy called for comprehensively addressing terrorism in all its forms.""Extremist ideologies must be challenged and countered,"" she said.Over the years, Lodhi said, peacekeeping had remained the UN's flagship enterprise for conflict prevention, mediation and sustaining peace.“Pakistan, as one of the world's top troop contributing country, was proud to have played its part in bringing hope to the lives of millions of people, caught up in conflict across the world.”“This year alone, five Pakistani peacekeepers had paid the ultimate sacrifice to uphold international peace and security,” she added.Pakistani peacekeepers, she said, had always displayed the highest standards of professionalism and conduct."
712,"A Pakistani tycoon travelled all the way to snow-capped peaks in northern Pakistan to convince investors, clients, and company executives that the country is safe for business.Zia Chisti, chose a unique way of ensuring his clients understand that Pakistan, which has struggled against rampant terrorism, has changed since The Economist termed it as “the world’s most dangerous place” almost a decade ago, Bloomberg reported. The businessman, who grew up in Lahore, gathered a group to ski in the Karakoram mountain range in Pakistan. The group included Alessandro Benetton, heir to the billionaire family that owns the iconic namesake Italian clothing company, and Huawei Technologies Co. rotating Chief Executive Officer Guo Ping. “Pakistan by any reasonable and adaptive measure is an extremely safe place to do business,” said Chishti, whose office oversees the White House. “All in all it’s a very favourable place to do business and the world perception just has to catch up.”Multiple military operations have curbed terrorist groups operating in the country. Last year, civilian deaths from terrorism dropped to the lowest in more than a decade.Pakistan’s global competitiveness ranking has improved in the past two years, moving above the bottom 20 countries, according to a World Economic Forum report released this week.

713,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Tuesday denied allegations of changing a clause in the Election Act regarding belief in the finality of Prophethood.While speaking to the media, Law Minister Zahid Hamid remarked: “God forbid, we can’t even think of doing such a thing.”“It is being alleged that we have removed the clause from the Act,” he said, explaining that the clause regarding belief in the finality of Prophethood of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is still a part of the Constitution.Zahid Hamid also compared the amended law to the previous Act in order to prove that the clause has not been removed.He read from both versions of the law and said: ""In the older Act, the nomination form required the consent of the person, his political affiliation, his belief in the finality of Prophethood, and faithful declaration to follow the vision of Quaid-e-Azam which is followed by other questions.""Similarly, form 'A' of the new Act also asks for a person’s consent, political affiliation, belief in the finality of Prophethood, Quaid-e-Azam’s vision, followed by other questions, said the law minister. “They are exactly the same, there is no change,” he pointed out, adding that it is ""sad that our opponents are criticising us for it"".Speaking about the Elections Bill 2017, which was passed in the National Assembly on Monday, he said that “all parties were consulted before the bill was passed.”The bill pertaining to elections has been passed after 40 years, he said, adding that the present law combines eight laws pertaining to elections.Since the passing of the bill, many opposition members have protested against it for different reasons and have announced that they would move the courts against it."

If it is my lawful duty to be here, I´m happy to be here,"" he added.""I've given enough evidence to prove my case.""Known for his lavish lifestyle, Mallya made Kingfisher beer a global brand and ran a now-defunct airline with the same name.Mallya stepped down as the director of the Indian Premier League cricket team Royal Challengers Bangalore last year.His financial dealings are being investigated by the federal Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, a financial crimes agency.Mallya was once known as the ""King of Good Times"" but dropped off India's most wealthy list in 2014, engulfed by the massive debts of his grounded carrier Kingfisher Airlines.He has been living in a sprawling $15 million (13 million euro) mansion in southeast England but has denied absconding."
719,"Universal Pictures and Disney’s Buena Vista International are teaming for M Night Shyamalan’s latest movie, Glass.The movie is the sequel to Unbreakable (2000), which starred Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, and will follow-up events from the movie Split (2017), which starred James McAvoy.Unbreakable was released by Disney's Touchstone label while Split was released by Universal.Shyamalan had sought Disney’s permission for a surprise cameo of Willis’s character from Unbreakable in Split. The cameo proved to be quite popular and led to fans wanting a sequel to filmmaker’s 2000 hit.The director shared the excitement of the first day of production on his social media account.He wrote: “Day 1: Seventeen years in the making. #Glass”Earlier on, the director had hinted towards the sequel by sharing an image of a glass with Elijah’s [Samuel L Jackson’s character from Unbreakable] face on it. Unbreakable revolved around the life of a security guard David (Willis), who astonishingly emerges unscathed from a train crash. A comic book collector and connoisseur, Elijah (Samuel L Jackson), offers an unsettling explanation for this and David's life is changed forever. The following is the official synopsis of the upcoming movie: ""From Unbreakable, Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn as does Samuel L Jackson as Elijah Price, known also by his pseudonym Mr Glass. Joining from Split are James McAvoy, reprising his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities who reside within, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only captive to survive an encounter with The Beast. Following the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb’s superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men. This riveting culmination of his worldwide blockbusters will be produced by Shyamalan and Jason Blum, who also produced the writer/director’s previous two films for Universal.

We are convinced it should be based on the meticulous adherence to the principles of equality, respect of national interests and non-interference in domestic affairs.""Putin again expressed condolences to the American people following the Las Vegas shooting which killed at least 59 people and wounded more than 500.Putin´s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier Tuesday that the Russian president wanted to restore ties with the United States but stressed he could not do it alone.""So far there are certain problems when it comes to reciprocity,"" Peskov told reporters.""But we hope that with the new ambassador at the helm at least the US diplomatic mission in Moscow will be able to contribute to the restoration of our relations.""US President Donald Trump has pledged to improve ties between the two countries which slumped to their lowest point since the Cold War over the Ukraine crisis.But allegations of collusion between Russia and members of Trump´s election campaign team overshadowed those promises.The 57-year-old Huntsman, who served as governor of Utah, has worked in numerous US administrations, notably as ambassador to China under Democrat president Barack Obama, before running unsuccessfully for president as a Republican in 2012.Huntsman said during his confirmation hearing last week that there is ""no question"" Russia interfered in the US presidential race and that Moscow continues to ""threaten stability"" in Europe.""I look forward to working to rebuild trust between our two countries and to strengthening the bilateral relationship based on cooperation on common interests,"" the new US ambassador said after the Kremlin ceremony.""I will seek out Russian people from all walks of life to share perspectives, to relay American values, and to deepen my growing appreciation for Russia´s rich and fascinating history and culture,"" he added.The US embassy in Moscow said Huntsman would return to Washington for ""final consultations"" before assuming his post in Russia next week.Huntsman will be performing one of the most difficult jobs on the diplomatic circuit.One of his predecessors, Michael McFaul, left the post under a cloud after just two years in Russia.McFaul, who left in 2014, sparked Moscow´s fury with critical comments and meetings with Russian opposition leaders and was harassed by pro-Kremlin youth activists and TV channels.His successor, career diplomat John Tefft was summoned out of retirement and served as US ambassador to Russia between 2014 and 2017."

But he has also pressured Canada to open up its protected dairy market.Ottawa and Washington are among the world´s closest allies and trading partners, with more than half a trillion (US) dollars worth of goods exchanged annually.But the US Commerce Department´s announcement last week that it would impose a steep countervailing duty on Bombardier´s new CSeries jetliners was met with outrage.Trudeau warned he would call off a US$5.2 billion purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets to partially replace its ageing fleet of F-18s if the aircraft´s manufacturer Boeing did not drop its anti-dumping lawsuit against Bombardier.He also drew a line in the sand, saying Ottawa would walk away from the trade talks if Washington insisted on a demand to nix NAFTA dispute resolution tribunals.Trudeau previously met Trump at the White House in February.""The United States is Canada´s top economic partner, and it´s important that we continue to work together to strengthen trade, investment and economic opportunity for people on both sides of our border,"" Trudeau said.Immediately following his October 12-13 trip to Washington, Trudeau will head south for his first official visit to Mexico, where he will also discuss trade with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.Trudeau said he looked forward also to meeting with Pena Nieto and Mexican civil society to ""deepen relations between our two countries."""

What it does is require the Cuban government to be able to fulfill their obligations with the safety and well-being and protection of foreign diplomats in their country.""The US diplomats leaving Cuba are expected to be out of the country by the end of the week.""We would need full assurances from the Cuban government that these attacks will not continue before we can even talk and plan"" for resuming operations in Havana, he said.Most importantly, Tillerson wants ""to focus on the safety and well-being of our personnel. Once having made that decision we then moved on to consider ensuring that there would be an equitable impact in our two embassies ability to operate.""The State Department gave the Cubans a list of which diplomats they wanted to be expelled.Routine US visa operations in Havana were suspended indefinitely in response to the attacks.US officials had previously told reporters they believed some kind of inaudible sound weapon was used on the US staff either inside or outside their residences in Havana.Canadians in Cuba have also been hurt, with a source close to that country's embassy telling AFP that more than five families were affected, including several children.Observers doubt that Cuba would have risked antagonizing its neighbors at the end of 2016 - when relations between the former Cold War enemies were thawing, before they deteriorated under Trump.The head of North American affairs at Cuba´s foreign ministry, Josefina Vidal, earlier told state television that Cuba wants to work with the United States to resolve this case."

734,"LONDON: Uber’s new global boss Dara Khosrowshahi will meet London’s transport regulator on Tuesday as the taxi-hailing app fights to keep its license in one of its most important foreign markets.Transport for London (TfL), which runs and regulates the capital’s transport system, shocked Uber last month by deeming it unfit to run a taxi service and refusing to renew its license.TfL cited the firm’s approach to reporting serious criminal offences and background checks on drivers.Reuters reported on Monday that Uber’s top boss in Britain, Jo Bertram, would be quitting in the next few weeks to take up an undisclosed new role outside the company.Uber’s British management has been criticized by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who is also chairman of TfL. Khan said the firm needed to spend less time hiring “an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers” and instead address issues raised by TfL.Khan, a center-left politician from Britain’s opposition Labour Party, approved Tuesday’s meeting between Khosrowshahi and TfL Commissioner Mike Brown, who is in charge of TfL’s day-to-day operations.Uber’s license expired on Sept. 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers are still be able to take passengers until an appeals process is exhausted, which could take several months.Khosrowshahi was appointed Uber chief executive in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70-billion dollar firm.He is battling to steer a new course for the app, which has faced regulatory crackdowns, court cases, bans and protests around the world, as well as several boardroom controversies.In a sign of broader problems facing Uber, Khosrowshahi is also expected to call into a contentious board meeting in San Francisco on Tuesday which will look at cutting the influence of Kalanick, sources said.The meeting will consider proposals to strip early investors of supervoting power and secure a multibillion-dollar investment. Kalanick, ousted by investors in June, contends that fellow Uber board members are moving too fast on a dramatic restructuring, sources said.Trying to repair relations with the authorities in London, Khosrowshahi last week struck a more conciliatory tone in an open letter to Londoners, marking a new approach for a firm which has deployed a combative style to break into closed markets around the world.“It’s ... true that we’ve got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologize for the mistakes we’ve made,” he wrote in the open letter.Uber’s fate in London will be decided by a judge who will rule on the appeal after it is submitted by Oct. 13.Uber’s competitors are already trying to take its business. London’s second-biggest private hire firm Addison Lee said on Friday it was planning to increase its driver numbers in London by up to a quarter.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters the announcement was designed to tap into the growing uncertainty among Uber drivers over their futures."

If it´s not me, you´ve got Pat Cummins who can bowl fast bouncers and Josh Hazlewood bowling consistent line and length,"" Starc was quoted as saying by the Daily Telegraph.""It´ll be much like that attack did when Johnno (Johnson) took all those wickets, I think we complement each other really well.""Australia´s five-test Ashes series against holders England starts in Brisbane on Nov. 23."
736,"ISLAMABAD: The documents submitted to the court must have been verified and free from any doubt, observed Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Mian Saqib Nisar on Tuesday. He gave the remarks during the hearing of a petition seeking the disqualification of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan for non-disclosure of assets, ownership of offshore companies and party foreign funding.The Supreme Court's three-member bench, headed by the chief justice and including Justice Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Faisal Arab, is hearing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz member Hanif Abbasi's petition. At the start of the hearing, the bench inquired about the absence of Imran's counsel Naeem Bukhari, to which PTI lawyer Anwar Mansoor replied that Bukhari was submitting documents at the time.During the hearing, Abbasi's counsel Akram Sheikh said the documents submitted by the PTI are suspicious, adding that the signatures on the two letters submitted also do not match.Justice Nisar observed that the bench noted this observation at the last hearing. ""There are other mistakes along with the tax number and signature,"" he remarked.During the hearing, the chief justice remarked that even if the Bani Gala estate is benami [not in actual owner's name], the actual owner was Jemima, Imran's ex-wife. He observed further that the trail of only 6.5 per cent of the funds has not been proved. ""It was said that Niazi Services Limited was formed to avoid the taxes on the London flats and Imran’s personal funds were also deposited in the Niazi Services Limited's account,"" he remarked further. He added that the details of the account from 2003 onwards have also not provided, and, according to the petitioner, the 99,000 pounds present in the account should have been declared as well. Bukhari argued before the court that the amount was an asset of Niazi Services Limited, to which the chief justice remarked that evidence needs to be provided that the funds were used in legal action.During last week’s hearing, the apex court had appeared dissatisfied with Bukhari’s arguments. The PTI counsel had said that an email had been sent to Imran’s former wife Jemima Khan, who had confirmed receiving 75,000 pounds and assured that she would send the bank details after finding them.To this, the bench had said that the documents did not prove that Imran Khan had brought money back from London.The petition seeks the disqualification of PTI chief Imran Khan and PTI secretary general Jahangir Tareen for non-disclosure of assets, ownership of offshore companies and foreign-funding of PTI.Justice Umar said that the documents do not prove that Imran Khan brought money back from LondonOn September 23, Abbasi submitted documents in the Supreme Court containing tax returns provided by Imran to the Election Commission of Pakistan in his nomination papers for the 2003-2006 period.The documents submitted by Abbasi included financial details of the sale of Imran’s London apartment in 2004. The documents also did not have any mention of a loan taken from Imran’s former wife Jemima Khan for the PTI chief's Bani Gala residence."

738,"KARACHI: University of Karachi Professor Dr Muhammad Ismail, who teaches at the department of Islamic Studies (Usool-ud-Din) was reported missing on Tuesday.According to family members, around two weeks ago, late at night some unknown people broke into the house and forcefully took the professor with them.The Security Adviser UoK said that Ismail’s wife gave the report of his disappearance some time back to the chairman of the department, who forwarded the issue to Dean of Islamic Learning and Vice Chancellor of the university.The university administration, however, remained mum on the subject of the professor’s disappearance for 15 days.The university administration, including VC Dr Ajmal Khan refused to speak regarding the incident when inquired. On Sept 21, the members of an intelligence agency carried out a raid and nabbed three alleged terrorists from the University of Karachi's staff colony.Official sources said that a captured Ansarul Shariah member, Danish Rasheed, tipped the authorities regarding the presence of three terrorists who were spending the night in the staff colony of KU. As a result, the raid was conducted and arrests made.Ansarul Shariah came to light earlier in September after the group's involvement was alleged in the Eid-day attack on Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Khawaja Izharul Hassan. "

740,"A Qatari woman who created ripples by appearing on television without a headscarf has broken new ground as a jockey in the conservative Gulf country, where men usually hold the reins.Maryam al-Subaiey has defied expectation and tradition — as well as any fear of controversy — to pursue her ""dream"" of racing horses, which even a nasty fall this year could not crush.""I don't have to do things that society expects from me as a woman,"" Subaiey, 31, told AFP.""I am expected to be a businesswoman and eventually get married and have kids.""She adds: ""But being a female athlete, this is not something that is considered Qatari.""It's just not expected. It's very different.""Subaiey's dream came true on February 24 at Qatar's pastoral Racing and Equestrian Club, a green oasis on the western fringes of the capital Doha.There, on the undercard of an eight-race meeting, she took to the track for the very first time.Subaiey didn't win — she finished eleventh out of 14 runners in the ""Thoroughbred Handicap"" on her mount ""Comedy Night"".But more notable than her final position was the fact she competed at all.Women have raced before in Qatar — indeed there was another non-Qatari female jockey in the same handicap and there are local media reports dating back to 2008 about a 14-year-old amateur riding at the equestrian club.But although records are not conclusive, officials told AFP that Subaiey was the first ever Qatari female jockey to take part in such a ranking event.""I still can't believe that I am here,"" she said immediately afterwards.""The importance of my presence here isn't just the fact that I am the first female Qatari jockey — I am here for all female Qataris and all female Khaleejis,"" she said, referring to women from the Gulf.Her groundbreaking ride also took many in attendance by surprise.""To be honest, I didn't think there were female jockeys here,"" said one Western racegoer.Subaiey is well-known among some Qataris.Last year, she appeared on France 24 Arabic television to discuss how Qatari women view their role in society.There was a backlash though as she appeared on screen not wearing a headscarf.One online commenter called her ""a bad example"" for Qatari women.Another more vehement poster wrote: ""Education is no good if it results in disobeying God's orders.""Subaiey — speaking at the racetrack without a headscarf -- responded simply: ""I have the freedom to choose what and what not to wear.""Subaiey's gallop into history began back in August 2014 during what she described as a ""very difficult time in my life"".She had lost her job as a video director for a local television station and wanted a change of direction.Although she had ridden horses as a child she had no experience as a jockey.But she said: ""This is something I wanted to do for a very long time. I love horses and I thought, why not?""One of those why nots was social convention in Qatar.Being a female jockey was seen by some as ""not prestigious"" in such a traditional society, admitted Subaiey, who wears the same style of racing silks to compete in as her male jockey counterparts.But although her desire to become a jockey may have raised a few eyebrows, Subaiey said she has the support of her family, who had no prior involvement in the horse racing world, and many compatriots -- ""even Qatari men"".""All I hear is positive comments,"" she added.""A lot of young girls tell me that I inspire them. That's what I want to do.""Another ""why not"" would be the number of female sports stars in Qatar.Despite using sport to brand itself globally, including in horse racing where Qatar sponsors major events in France and Britain including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Goodwood Festival, there are few homegrown female sports stars.Qatar took just two female athletes to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, even fewer than the four in London in 2012, the first time Qatar had taken female competitors to the Games.As part of her training to become a jockey, Subaiey has trained with noted British jockey Steve Smith Eccles at his school in the British ""racing capital"", Newmarket.She was training hard for up to six hours a day.However, disaster struck in her second race back home in March.She fell from her horse, sustaining severe injuries, including a double fracture to her pelvis.""My family was so devastated, but they know I am going to go back to racing. They know I am stubborn and they know I can never say no,"" she said.Subaiey plans to get back in the saddle and continue her training in Newmarket in October.""If anything, more than ever before, I have something to prove."""

742,"He was the one to lead Pakistan to Kerry Packer’s circus; he was behind the country’s maiden ‘away’ series win; he was influential in making the team ‘tough’ as well as serving the game after retirement. The name, Asif Iqbal Rizvi, came to my mind after Pakistan’s recent defeat in the first Test against Sri Lanka at Abu Dhabi – the country urgently needs a player of his calibre.Asif Iqbal remained the man of crisis for years, long before Javed Miandad dethroned him. The tour to Australia in 1976-77 was the prime example, when a courageous display of batting by Asif helped Pakistan match the Aussies. In the first Test at Adelaide, he took the score from 298/6 to 466, adding 81 runs for the last wicket. The contribution of the debutant Iqbal Qasim was 4, while Asif remained unbeaten on 152. In pursuit of 285, the home team abandoned the chase at 261/6, turning a certain victory into a draw. In the final Test, he scored 120, crafting useful partnerships with Miandad and debutant Haroon Rasheed, in a score of 360. Pakistan won the Test largely due to Imran Khan’s 12 wickets, but it would not have been possible without Asif. The 70s cannot even be imagined without Asif Iqbal. In the early days of internet in Pakistan, I ‘met’ my maternal uncle from India after 15 years. Someone who was brought up in the 70s, he had, and still has, enviable knowledge of movies and sports. A discussion on cricket, via e-mails, came up and he admitted: “We wished we had an Asif in India, during the 70s.” My work brought me to ‘the Asif’ himself, 20 years later, and an interview took me further back in time.It was in January 1961, when a 17-year old Asif took six wickets in a side match against visiting Pakistan. Asif lost his father before his first birthday, but it was his maternal uncle’s guidance that made him an excellent cricketer. His uncle, Ghulam Ahmed, was a Test cricketer and went on to captain India as well.Asif migrated to Pakistan later that year. It was Eaglets tour to England in 1963 which saw him rise as an all-rounder. Tough situations usually got the best out of him. He got six wickets against Cambridge University, five against Kent and also smashed an unbeaten 74, which helped his side acquire victory. He collected 19 wickets on that tour.He got lucky and was selected for the upcoming Test series against Australia. It was in Karachi, in October 53 years ago, when he made his debut with five others. It was in 1967, again in England, when Asif mesmerized everyone with his skills. On phone from England, Asif recalled his first Test century at the Oval. “It was the 3rd and final Test, we were heading towards a heavy defeat and the score was 65/8. The crowd was there due to a Bank Holiday. There was talk of an exhibition match in case of early finish. I got furious and decided to have a go.”With Intikhab Alam, he put on a record 190 runs, top scoring with 146. The match was lost, but an innings defeat was averted. Of course, the crowd was enthralled till the end. Most of his centuries were scored when the team needed it. His favourite scoring grounds, apart from England, were in Australia and New Zealand.Along with Hanif Muhammad, he was named ‘Cricketer of the Year’ by Wisden in 1968. He chose English county Kent over others, when he was offered to represent them as an overseas player. He played for them till 1982, helping them win the Championship after 57 years.He was Intikhab’s deputy when Pakistan won their maiden ‘away’ series in 1972/73. It was the 2nd Test at Dunedin where Asif (175) put on 350 runs for the 4th wicket with Mushtaq Muhammad (201), helping his side win by an innings against New Zealand. Asif captained Pakistan in both Prudential World Cups, but West Indies were stronger and luckier than Pakistan on both occasions.The 11 Tests played between October 1976 and April 1977 had ingredients of a thriller. There were ‘pay issues’ between board and players, rise of the greatest, clash of the fastest, and a match saving innings with a retirement. Asif Iqbal was connected to each of them. He was leading the players against the BCCP, which was not raising the Test match allowances; was at the other end when Miandad scored his century on debut; and scored three hundreds against the best quickies on Earth; two in Australia in his usual ‘rescue-mode’ and one in the fifth Test against West Indies which was his last Test, for some time. “I decided to quit before Jamaica Test, as I had been approached by Tony Greig to join the World Series cricket. I put forward a condition, that the only thing that could bring me back would be a series between India and Pakistan, which was last held in 1961.” Asif went on to play 9 Tests against India.India visited Pakistan in 1978/79, nearly after 23 years. Asif smashed a hundred in his comeback Test. In the second Test, he helped in chasing 126 runs in the final session, which became Pakistan’s first win at home. In the final Test at Karachi, he was promoted to open the innings with Majid Khan, when Pakistan needed 164 runs in over 100 minutes. Ironically, both players made their debut as ‘opening bowlers’ at the same ground, fifteen years earlier. Later, Asif and Javed, with innovative running and excellent placement of the ball, put on 97 runs in 9 overs.When Pakistan paid a return visit next year, the results were reversed. “India, no doubt, played better than us, Imran’s injury proved crucial and our batsmen failed to perform this time around,” Asif reminisced about his only ‘Test’ tour as in-charge.Just before the final Test, Asif led Pakistan against South Zone at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad Deccan. This was the same stadium where 19 years ago, he faced Pakistan as one of the members of the South Zone team, taking six wickets.The final Test at Calcutta (now Kolkata) ended in a draw. Cruising well in pursuit of 265 on the fifth day, Asif got run-out in the last Test innings of his career. The dismissal put the brakes on the chase and the visitors had to settle for a draw.“Going to India for my last Test was emotional, that too when I was given a standing ovation by the crowd. On my return, I was asked by Air Marshal (Retd.) Nur Khan, the new Cricket Board chief, to rethink about retirement. He even offered me a farewell, but I declined.” Asif scored 3,575 Test runs at an average of 38.85, with 11 hundreds and 12 fifties.He soon excelled as an administrator and was influential in setting up cricket in the United Arab Emirates. It started when a businessman from Sharjah, Abdul Rehman Bukhatir, wanted to financially help ‘Little Master’ Hanif Mohammad. He met Asif in London for this purpose and Cricketers’ Benefit Funds Series came into being.3rd April 1981; a benefit match for Hanif Mohammad and Asif Iqbal was organized at the newly constructed Sharjah Stadium. Miandad XI took on Gavaskar XI, in front of 8,000 people, on a Friday. The beneficiaries were presented cheques of $50,000 each. CBFS went to reward a lot of cricketers, initially from the subcontinent, and later from around the world. Pakistan will be playing their next Test in Dubai. Asif Iqbal was the one who brought cricket to the desert years ago. Pakistan have never lost a series in UAE, it’s about time that one of the players does an ‘Asif Iqbal’, and keep the team’s unbeaten run intact. "

744,"BARCELONA: Barcelona metro stations were closed, pickets blocked main roads and civil servants walked out on Tuesday in response to a strike called by pro-independence groups after hundreds were injured in a Spanish police crackdown on a banned independence referendum.The stoppages, originally billed as a region-wide general strike but disavowed by the country’s largest unions, affected the public sector, public transport and basic services.Normally busy metro stations in Barcelona were deserted as services were cut back sharply, pickets blocked traffic on Gran Via street and traffic on six major highways in the region was disrupted by protests.Elsewhere, the response to the strike call was patchy with some shops, supermarkets and cafes open and some closed. The Boqueria market in Barcelona was almost empty.Pro-independence groups and trade unions in Catalonia called a general strike for Tuesday after Spanish police forcibly tried to close polling stations on Sunday after a referendum on Catalan independence from Spain was banned by the constitutional court.Scenes of armoured Spanish police swinging truncheons and firing rubber bullets at peaceful voters have been widely condemned, with the European Union calling for talks to break the stalemate between Madrid and Barcelona.On Sunday, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the ballot had failed, while Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont vowed to continue with the independence process after millions voted to leave.Spain’s two largest unions on Monday said they would not take part in the general strike and also called for dialogue between the central government and Catalonia, criticizing both the call for independence and the heavy-handed police tactics.“The UGT and the CCOO clearly state that we do not back this position or this political strategy. We are not calling a general strike for October 3,” they said on Monday.However, many services under the control of the Catalan government did see some stoppages, with public transport running at around 40 percent, according to reports, while port workers and civil servants also walked out.Entrances to some government offices were blocked by crowds protesting in favour of independence."

746,"SINGAPORE: Aamir Khan, the Bollywood superstar with a conscience, says his next movie about a small town teenage girl who uses the Internet to become a singing sensation will be much bigger than his last film, which was India’s highest grossing ever.Khan, 52, plays a sleazy music producer in the film “Secret Superstar” and says he is second lead to teenager Zaira Wasim, playing a schoolgirl who defies her conservative Muslim family to pursue her dream of a singing career.Khan’s last film “Dangal”, or wrestling pit, was based on the true story of a former wrestler who trains two of his daughters to become champions in the sport. It was the highest grossing movie for Bollywood, as India’s Hindi film industry is known, and was powered by huge collections in China.“While both are about the empowerment of the girl child, I feel it (Secret Superstar) is a much bigger film,” Khan said in an interview in Singapore ahead of the movie’s release later this month. He and his wife have produced the film.“While Dangal was about the dream of a father which a daughter fulfils, this is about the hopes and aspirations of a 14-year-old girl from a small town in India. I don’t know what the box office will be but it’s a bigger film than Dangal in what it’s trying to say.”Three of Khan’s films are in Bollywood’s top four all-time hits. Besides Dangal, these include “PK”, in which he played an alien dealing with religious divisions in India, and “3 Idiots”, about the frailties in India’s education system.All three have also done well in China, and Khan said he was “very happy with the type of relationship that’s building between me and my audience in this part of the world with each film”.He also produced and acted in a popular television documentary series on social ills in India called “Satyameva Jayate”, or Truth Alone Triumphs.That series led him to set up a non-profit to work on a project to ease the shortage of water in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, he said.Despite the social messages in his movies, Khan said he has no desire to become a politician, as some other Bollywood stars have.“The desire in me to contribute back to society is something I can do very well in the field that I am in,” he said. “I don’t have to join politics. That’s an area I don’t ever want to go into.”Khan, who belongs to India’s Muslim minority, was embroiled in controversy two years ago when he said his Hindu wife had asked him if they should move out of India over concerns about insecurity. Khan later said the family had no plans to leave.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government has been accused of intolerance towards liberal and dissenting views.Khan said intolerance had not affected his ability to express himself as an actor.”For me, when I‘m making a film, my primary responsibility is to give my audience a good time. Then if it’s giving a message which is important and creative, if it’s changing the way we look at things, great.“If it’s giving a message which is highly negative, then I would not be a part of it.”"
747,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif called on Tuesday for the restoration of the people's right to govern. He was addressing a meeting of the party's general council which elected him the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz president for four years earlier. He said there is anger in his heart too — to say so otherwise would be hypocrisy. Referring to the amendment and passing of the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017, Nawaz said they have repealed the 'dictator's law'. The PML-N leader was elected unopposed during the meeting of party's general council""You know the reason for my disqualification,"" said Nawaz, adding that PML-N is still the country's biggest political party. The former premier thanked workers for greeting him during his GT Road Rally in August. ""Respected general council members, history shows the struggle of the Muslim League,"" Nawaz said further. “If there was nothing in the Panama [Papers] then people should have been told this. They should have informed the people of the truth, that Nawaz Sharif did not misuse any public funds,” he said.“This has been happening for the last 70 years,” said Nawaz, adding that we need to think about what led to the breakup of the country [in 1971].All countries in the world keep changing their policies with time, and those who ignore changing dynamics and stick to the old practice time passes them by.  He said it is tragic that 'we' continue to do the same things that led to the breakup of the country. ""Despite being elected by the people thrice, I was disqualified. Not because of any corruption or malpractice but for not taking a salary from my son,"" said the ousted premier. Nawaz reiterated that the 12 questions he posed at the lawyers' convention in Lahore on August 25 have yet to be answered. Talking about cases against democratic leaders, he said the case that led to his disqualification is similar to the one which led to the hanging of an elected prime minister, referring to Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. However, ""[the cases of those] who violated the Constitution remained honest and truthful"", claimed Nawaz.  ""I'm warning you, if we don't try to change things then even Pakistan will not forgive us."" God helps those who help themselves, he added. The former prime minister narrated his democracy-friendly actions of the past, such as not disrupting the previous Pakistan Peoples Party government in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and letting Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf form a government in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa after the 2013 elections. Nawaz said he is hopeful that party will fare even better in the 2018 elections, adding that the people will give their decision regarding [his] 'eligibility' then. "
748,"KARACHI: Police in the metropolis have made no progress in the hunt for the 'knife attacker' responsible for a spate of attacks on women in the Gulistan-e-Jauhar area of the metropolis. The six suspects arrested by the police earlier have been released from custody. Police have released a video of the ‘knife attacker’ in which the suspect can be seen attacking a woman with a sharp object.""The suspect appears to be a thin man, aged 20-29,"" East DIG Sultan Khawaja said, adding that ""he appears to be five feet, seven to nine inches tall"" and usually rides a red motorcycle.The official also announced that anyone who helps provide information, which could lead to the suspect's arrest, would be awarded Rs0.5 million."
749,"LAHORE: Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) challenged on Tuesday the Elections Bill 2017 in the Lahore High Court (LHC), pleading to have the law declared null and void.The recently-passed bill contains a clause which allows politicians disqualified from holding public office to lead political parties — an apparent bid by the government to re-elect ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif as the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president.In the petition, the PAT has argued that the bill is against the spirit of the Constitution by enabling a disqualified person to become a party leader.Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and Sheikh Rasheed-led Awami Muslim League have also decided to challenge the law.Today, the PML-N is holding intra-party elections to re-elect Nawaz, a day after the Elections Bill 2017 was passed.The PML-N leaders will hold a meeting of its general council to elect a new party presidentThe National Assembly on Monday passed the Elections Bill 2017, paving way for the former prime minister to regain chairmanship of the ruling party.The bill was also ratified by President Mamnoon Hussain.Enraged opposition members had protested the passing of the bill and tore copies of it after it was presented by Law Minister Zahid Hamid.In his address, Rasheed said: You are risking the country's democracy over one person. “You have attacked the Supreme Court with a rocket launcher,” he added.“You can start digging the grave of democracy with your majority,” he said while referring to the PML-N parliamentarians.In its meeting headed by the party’s interim president Sardar Yaqub Nasir at Punjab House, the CWC unanimously accepted the amendmentPTI's Shah Mehmood Qureshi remarked that clause 203 of the bill is against the spirit of the country's Constitution.The clause seeks to help an unqualified man to become the head of a party, he said, adding that the Supreme Court had also disqualified the person.""You [PML-N] have the majority and we are a minority. But, if you pass the bill then we will challenge it in the court. We want clause 203 to be removed and Political Parties' Order must be restored,"" said Qureshi. "
750,"On Monday morning, Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s minister of interior, was denied entry to the accountability court proceedings by the Rangers deployed at the court. To his credit, the interior minister spoke out immediately, decrying the obvious problem of a minister being barred from entering open court proceedings by members of a security force that report to the same ministry.Informal spokespersons of the military (there are thousands on social media and across the wide population of commentators in our blessed republic), immediately cited reports of court orders to bar open entry to the court as the basis for the denial of entry. But the accountability court judge has denied issuing such orders. The commissioner of Islamabad also denied asking the Rangers to restrict entry to the courts in his jurisdiction. And the interior minister has of course been emphatic that he knew of no plans to restrict entry to the proceedings of the court.Unless the guards posted at the court acted on the strength of their own conviction – which is unlikely, given how disciplined our military and paramilitary forces are – someone has acted to undermine the authority of the interior minister. Quite rightly, democrats in Pakistan are upset by this brazen stutter in the chain of command at the interior ministry. The question many are asking is: “Who is running this country?”Before we answer this, we should quickly examine the winners and losers from Rangers’ Gate. The military, always keen to put civilian leaders in their place, once again benefits from the demonstration of civilian impotence. It hardly matters whether a clever, scheming general or group of generals was behind Ahsan Iqbal’s denial of entry by the Rangers. What matters is that, when confronted, the civilian leader was reduced to complaining about his powerlessness on television. The military’s evolution into a modern war fighting machine, with great conviction about the power of psy-ops, means that such events – the reinforcement of its dominance in national affairs, and the corresponding helplessness of elected civilian leaders – are probably seen as victories well worth the cost of a handful of protesting tweets and op-eds.The PML-N, which is the closest proxy to elected civilian power in our country today, has once again leaned into what it believes to be a useful instrument in its fight for supremacy with the military. But this is a mistaken belief. Pakistan just had the best opening ten days of Muharram in recent memory, and the security with which Pakistanis walk their streets is largely credited to the military and its operations. We may be almost a year removed from #ThankYouRaheelSharif, but the bet here is that ordinary Pakistanis continue to thank the military for a safer Pakistan. A wartime military that has given thousands of soldiers in sacrifice to secure this safety is not a viable target for Nawaz Sharif and his lieutenants. The PML-N is not going to win a public diplomacy war against the military – even when the PML-N is 100 percent right and the military is 100 percent wrong.So Ahsan Iqbal may certainly have buttressed his credentials as a Nawazista outside the accountability courts in Islamabad, and he certainly won applause from business class democrats, including those writing op-eds in English language newspapers, but as victories go, he is playing one of the world’s smaller violins. The Pakistani street isn’t where Ahsan Iqbal or Nawaz Sharif need it to be.So who is in fact running this country? Of course, Rangers’ Gate did not happen in a vacuum. It happened at a court hearing for a disqualified former prime minister. The broader argument about whether Nawaz Sharif still owns the streets of Punjab as he did in 2013 is one that the PML-N and its opponents, principally the PTI, will have over the next several weeks and months. But three factors will weigh heavily on the outcome of that debate. The first is the extent to which the PML-N employs the civil-military imbalance as a tool to elicit support. As explained above, this tool is unlikely to work very well. Barring massive and sustained sets of miscalculations by the military, the audience for a critical narrative regarding the military is likely to be miniscule in Punjab.The second is clarity about a succession plan within the PML-N. Unlike third generation jiyalas in Sindh, the coalition of traders, working class urbanites and infrastructure democrats in Punjab that swept in the PML-N in 2013 is not immune to the news cycle. A struggle for the post-Nawaz Sharif leadership of the PML-N between Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif will force Noonies to choose sides. This erosion of coherence, even for a short period of time, alone could rend the ticket distribution for the PML-N to be a less than rational exercise. Punjab loves winners, and in-fighting for the throne in Raiwind is not the look of a winner. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the insidious emergence of a third force in Pakistani politics. Quietly, and without the fanfare that such a development should accompany, a trifecta of new right-wing political entities has landed as the main feature of the amuse-bouche to the 2018 election.In the 2013 election, the PML-N ran away with the Punjab Assembly. Out of 297 seats, it won 216. This margin is oft-cited as the foundation of an intergenerational dominance for the PML-N, which is partly why people like Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Hamza Shahbaz Sharif feel like they have something to fight for.The less heralded data from the 2013 election is that of the 297 seats contested in Punjab, the margin of victory was less than 10 percent of total votes cast in 129 seats.In NA-120, an intergenerational bastion for the PML-N, home constituency of the supposedly unassailable Nawaz Sharif, the combination of a new pro-Mumtaz Qadri political group, and the political wing of the LeT/JuD/FIF polled a total of 12,952 votes, out of a total of 125,129, or exactly 10.35 percent of the total votes cast in the NA-120 by-election.It is always too early to call curtains on Nawaz Sharif, a man who has survived coups, attempted coups, judicial interventions and all sorts of self-inflicted inanities and stupidities. But the factors precipitating his political decline are lining up faster than Shahbaz Sharif can build roads and metros. They are lining up fast and furious.There are those among us who believe that the military runs Pakistan. To the extent that it determines, without civilian input, how to handle the threat of an RSS-run India, or an India-run Afghanistan, this is hard to argue with. The military not only does not seek civilian input, it often seems to be at odds with stated civilian leaders’ goals for regional harmony. It is also true that the military can define the national story in Pakistan almost at will.But the emergence of the right-wing trifecta of Qadri-ists, Hafiz Saeedists, and a third generation of Sipah-e-Sahaba politicians strewn across the country, represents something decidedly more complex than anything the military or civilians – even working together – can easily manage or predict.The threat posed by the neo-right wing in Pakistan is not existential or even structural – yet. However, in NA-120 it has proven its potency as being far beyond what is widely recognised. Continued mistakes by the PML-N, continued behind-the-scenes efforts by those affiliated with the military to tar and feather elected leaders, and continued failure by the mainstream parties to devise a coherent narrative that appeals to ordinary Pakistanis, especially in the cities of Punjab represents a dangerous concoction. No matter who is seen to have won Rangers’ Gate on Monday, or Tuesday, or Wednesday, the longer-term threat to a still emerging democracy will make losers of all of us. Pakistan lost on Monday. And the leadership necessary to stem the losing seems non-existent. The RSS, and its proxies in Western capitals, are all licking their lips.The writer is an analyst and commentator.www.mosharrafzaidi.comThis article was originally published in The News"
751,"WASHINGTON: The Trump administration will order nearly two-thirds of Cuba’s diplomatic personnel to leave the United States after months of mysterious “attacks” that have damaged the health of American embassy staff in Havana, according to a congressional source and a person familiar with the plan.The US State Department is expected to announce the expulsion on Tuesday, the sources said on Monday.The decision follows an announcement on Friday that the United States was cutting its diplomatic presence in Cuba by more than half as it warned US citizens not to visit because of unexplained incidents that have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in US embassy personnel.The latest plan was first reported by the Miami Herald, which cited a source as saying the expulsion of Cuban personnel was in “reciprocity” for the US drawdown from Havana.The steps being taken by President Donald Trump’s administration mark a further blow to his predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of rapprochement between Washington and Havana, former Cold War foes.The State Department declined to comment on an expulsion plan, except to say that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “continues to evaluate steps that the Department can take to ensure the Cuban government is accountable to its responsibility to protect diplomats.”Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be expelled in retaliation for the Cuban government’s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks.Trump administration officials planned to brief lawmakers on their Cuba policy on Tuesday, another congressional aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The State Department announced on Friday that in addition to drawing down staff in Havana to essential personnel, the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to US citizens.At least 21 US embassy employees in Cuba have been injured and reported symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues, and difficulty sleeping, the State Department said on Friday.Cuba’s Foreign Ministry Chief for US Affairs Josefina Vidal said last week that the US decision to reduce staff at its Havana embassy was hasty and will affect bilateral relations.Cuba, the United States and Canada have investigated the attacks, but the probe has not yielded any answers about how they were carried out or who was responsible for them.Cuba has denied involvement in the attacks. The State Department has not directly blamed Havana for them but asked two Cuban diplomats to leave Washington in May.The US measures will stop short of breaking off relations or closing the two countries’embassies, which reopened in 2015 following more than five decades of hostility.But the bizarre case has brought simmering US-Cuba tensions since Trump took office to a boil.Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month.He said he would not lift the US trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made “fundamental reforms.” Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.”"
752,"LAS VEGAS: The slot machines were still ringing and the drinks still flowing but the party didn’t feel quite the same along the world-famous Las Vegas Strip on Monday evening, 24 hours after a gunman staged the bloodiest shooting in modern US history.The somber mood was especially pronounced at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, where police say a retiree with an arsenal of assault rifles rained hundreds of bullets into a crowd of concert-goers below his room, killing at least 59 and injuring more than 500.A hush had descended over the Mandalay hotel lobby that, in normal times, bustles with excitement at nearly every hour of the day or night. The shrieking gamblers, the bachelorettes with oversized cocktails, the high-rollers spruced up for an expensive evening out, all were nowhere to be seen.Instead, a few solitary gamblers sat with glassy eyes in front of slot machines in the lobby. Four security officers unceremoniously escorted a Reuters reporter out when she tried to interview a casino guest.“It’s eerie. People are trying to enjoy it, but there’s a cloud hanging over the city right now,” said Greg Hartnett, 31, who had arrived for his first visit to Vegas earlier in the day.Hartnett, who lives near the site of the 2007 massacre of 32 people at Virginia Tech university, said Sunday’s rampage reminded him of that bloodbath.“It really shows the dark side of humanity,” he said.Vegas cabbie Alex Sanchez said his passengers were much less chatty than usual, and there were many fewer cars on the road.“People come here for an escape. They want to leave their stresses behind,” Sanchez said. “And this really puts a damper on it.”Despite the overall gloominess, people along the Strip appeared more ready than on a more carefree day to hold a door or share a quiet smile with strangers.”I’ve been thanking every police officer I see,“ said Hartnett. ”I feel like it’s bringing people together.Sheriffs deputies and their gleaming white motorcycles were parked on the sidewalk in a show of force, perhaps intended to reassure anxious tourists.“Thanks for last night, guys,” shouted one passing woman."
753,"A top Myanmar official appealed on Monday for democracy in the country to be given “a chance to survive” amid international anger over a military campaign against Rohingya Muslims that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.Some 507,000 Rohingya Muslim have fled to Bangladesh since insurgents attacked security posts near the border on Aug. 25, triggering fierce Myanmar military retaliation. Myanmar says more than 500 people have been killed, most of them insurgents.National Security Adviser Thaung Tun told Reuters that he has spoken with his US counterpart, H.R. McMaster, on the phone and visited members of the US Congress in Washington last week. He said sanctions were not specifically discussed.The United States called last week on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar’s military, but it stopped short of threatening to reimpose US sanctions, which were suspended under the Obama administration.“We need to ensure that democracy has a chance to survive in Myanmar. This is a young democracy,” Thaung Tun told Reuters in an interview at the United Nations, noting that government leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has only been in office for 18 months.Suu Kyi assumed power following a landslide election win after former military leaders initiated a political transition. For years, the United States and others imposed sanctions on Myanmar in support of Suu Kyi’s campaign for democracy.“We have a lot of challenges and these challenges cannot be overcome in a day. Rome wasn’t built in a day. So we can’t undo 50 years of challenges,” said Thaung Tun, adding that he hoped to meet in person with McMaster, President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, to brief him on the current situation.A Trump administration official said last month the violence made it harder for the United States and Myanmar to build warmer ties, and there would likely be some “easing” in the short term, but he did not expect a return to sanctions.Thaung Tun said he had not met privately with U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley but had spoken to her briefly on the sidelines of other meetings in New York.The UN Security Council met publicly last week on Myanmar for the first time since 2009. Haley said the Myanmar authorities appeared to be carrying out “a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority.”She said countries should stop supplying weapons to Myanmar until the military has sufficient accountability measures.Thaung Tun said “action has been taken against a number of policemen who exceeded their bounds in dealing with detainees.”“We have very strict instructions for the security forces to carry out their duties within the bounds of the code of conduct,” he said. “Nobody is above the law.”He said that ethnic cleansing or genocide was not happening in Myanmar.The Myanmar government has said that there have no military operations since Sept. 5. But Thaung Tun said that since then security forces have responded when attacked.“Under the cover of night there have been some sporadic attacks and the police and the security people have been required to respond in self-defense,” he said.The Rohingya are denied citizenship and classified as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots in Myanmar that go back centuries, with communities marginalized and subjected to bouts of communal violence over the years.Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to set up a “working group” to plan the repatriation of those who had fled."

756,"NEW YORK: Tom Petty, the Southern-accented rocker whose classic melodies and dark storytelling created 40 years of hit songs, died Monday of cardiac arrest, his family said. He was 66.Petty, who sold 80 million records, passed away Monday evening surrounded by loved ones after a confusing day in which several media outlets reported and then retracted premature news of his death.""On behalf of the Tom Petty family we are devastated to announce the untimely death of our father, husband, brother, leader and friend Tom Petty,"" a family statement said.Early on Monday, Petty suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, exactly a week after he triumphantly put on what would be his career-capping concert.The rocker had wrapped up a tour celebrating 40 years of his band The Heartbreakers with three sold-out shows at the iconic Hollywood Bowl.He closed the encore with one of his earliest and best-known songs -- ""American Girl,"" which tells of an ambitious girl ""raised on promises"" but now contemplating suicide, set to electric guitar harmonies from the golden age of rock ´n´ roll.The song was one of many by Petty about struggling to overcome long odds. ""I Won´t Back Down,"" perhaps his best-known song, took on a second life as a US patriotic anthem after the September 11, 2001 attacks.The singer and guitarist -- recognizable for his shoulder-length blonde hair -- delivered his vocals in short punches that showed an underlying bitterness, such as on ""You Don´t Know How It Feels,"" or with a wistfulness as on ""Free Fallin´,"" a breakup story that ends in loneliness for all.The rocker´s characters -- small-town Americans full of aspirations but running into a wall of setbacks -- reflected the hardscrabble early life of Petty.His grandfather was a logger from Georgia rumored to have fled south to Florida after axing a man to death in an argument. Petty was born in Gainesville in northern Florida to a belligerently drunk father who sold wholesale tobacco and candy.Petty recalled that his father, intoxicated and unimpressed by his son´s passion for music, once smashed up the boy´s record collection.The future rocker said he told him, ""Dad, if you´ll just leave me alone, I´ll be a millionaire by the time I´m 35."" And his remark proved prophetic.Petty, speaking in 2015 to Men´s Journal, credited his mother Kitty with saving him by reading to him, introducing him to pop standards and showing him ""there was more to life than rednecks.""But he remained haunted by his father and consumed by inner rage. ""Any authority I didn´t agree with could just make me go crazy,"" he said of his early adulthood.He struggled with depression most of his life and formed an addiction to heroin, although later in life his only substance was marijuana and he calmed himself with transcendental meditation.Petty embraced the American South, especially on his 1985 album ""Southern Accents,"" but with a sound that was more Florida quirky than hillbilly.The album´s song ""Rebels"" spoke of Southern mischievousness while the trippy ""Don´t Come Around Here No More"" -- co-written with David A. Stewart of The Eurythmics and accompanied by an ""Alice in Wonderland"" themed video -- cemented Petty´s standing among stoners.""´Don´t Come Around Here No More´ changed the way I looked at songwriting and production. So odd and complex yet direct all at once,"" the indie rocker and producer Jack Antonoff wrote on Twitter.Touring the United States for ""Southern Accents,"" he pinned up a Confederate flag on stage -- a move he later regretted, telling Rolling Stone that ""people just need to think about how it looks to a black person"" as he likened the controversial symbol to a Nazi swastika.In a speech in February as he was presented a lifetime achievement award at the Grammys, Petty said he owed his greatest debt to African Americans such as Chuck Berry who created rock ´n´ roll.But he discovered rock ´n´ roll thanks to Britain when he saw The Beatles perform on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" in 1964.""I had my eyes opened like so many others and I joined the conspiracy to put black music on the popular white radio,"" Petty said.In the late 1980s, Petty joined one of The Beatles, George Harrison, in a supergroup, the Traveling Wilburys, that also featured Bob Dylan. The project was short-lived after the death of another member, Roy Orbison.The three-time Grammy winner was steadfast on artistic control and earned a reputation for battling with the music industry -- most memorably with the 1981 album ""Hard Promises"" after he was angered by his label´s plan to price it higher than usual.More recently, English singer Sam Smith agreed to credit Petty as a songwriter on his worldwide hit ballad ""Stay With Me"" due to the similarities -- coincidental, by all accounts -- in the chorus to the worldwide hit ""I Won´t Back Down."""

759,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Tuesday that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz was expecting the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to support the passing of the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017.He was addressing the meeting of the PML-N's general council in Islamabad where ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif was re-elected as the party's president. Iqbal said the amendment of the clause [barring disqualified parliamentarians from heading a political party] from the bill in the Senate was originally placed by former president General Ayub Khan, adding that it was then removed by PPP founder Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1975. ""It was then brought back into the law in 2002 by former president Gen Pervez Musharraf,"" said Iqbal, explaining that the idea then was to keep Benazir Bhutto from heading the PPP and Nawaz the PML-N. ""Last night, the National Assembly removed Musharraf’s ‘black law’,"" said Iqbal. He humbly asked the PPP how it could oppose the PML-N when it did what Bhutto did. ""We expected the PPP to stand with us. We all know Musharraf brought the NAB law to harass political opponents,"" he said further. The interior minister also praised Nawaz for his democratic and economic credentials. Referring to the opposition parties' intent to challenge the elections law in the Supreme Court, Iqbal said those who wish to turn the Supreme Court into a political party are enemies of the law and Constitution. Concluding his speech, Iqbal said, ""No more, enough is enough. Pakistan’s 20 million people have the right to decide the country’s future"". "
760,"LAS VEGAS: Investigators were desperately trying to establish the motive of a retired accountant who killed at least 59 people and wounded more than 500 after amassing a weapons cache in a hotel room and opening fire on the Las Vegas strip.As America grappled with the deadliest mass shooting in its history, officials reacted cautiously to a Daesh claim that Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, had carried out Sunday night´s massacre on behalf of the group.Police said Paddock, who had no criminal record, smashed windows in his 32nd floor hotel room shortly after 10:00 pm on Sunday and trained bursts of automatic weapons fire on thousands of people attending a country music concert below on the strip.In video footage of the massacre broadcast on CNN, the rattle of long, sustained gunfire is heard as people scream and scurry for cover. At first they did not know where the shots were coming from.""We saw bodies down. We didn´t know if they had fallen or had been shot,"" said Ralph Rodriguez, an IT consultant from the Pomona Valley, near Los Angeles, who was at the concert with a group of friends.""People started grabbing their loved-ones and just strangers, and trying to help them get out of the way,"" Rodriguez said.The Daesh group claimed that Paddock was one of its ""soldiers"" but the FBI said it had found no such connection so far and the local sheriff described him as a lone ""psychopath.""Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Paddock fired through the door of his hotel room and hit a security guard in the leg.But when a SWAT team stormed the room where Paddock had been staying since September 28, they found he had killed himself.A total of 23 firearms including automatic weapons were found in the hotel room, he said. A search of Paddock´s house in Mesquite, Nevada, 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Las Vegas, recovered 19 additional firearms, some explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo.Lombardo said investigators had discovered several pounds of an explosive called tannerite in the Mesquite home, as well as ammonium nitrate, a type of fertilizer, in the gunman´s car.He said the latest death toll was 59, while 527 people had been injured.The motive of the massacre was not yet known, he said.""We´re hunting down and tracing down every single clue that we can get on his background,"" the sheriff said at a late-night briefing.Lombardo said the authorities had found no manifesto or anything else to explain Paddock´s actions.""This individual is a lone wolf and I don´t know how it could have been prevented,"" he said earlier in the day. ""I can´t get into the mind of a psychopath at this point.""President Donald Trump denounced what he called ""an act of pure evil"" and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.But the White House pushed back at calls to reopen the US debate on tighter gun controls.""A motive is yet to be determined and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don´t fully know all of the facts or what took place last night,"" Trump´s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.Lombardo said Paddock had apparently used some kind of hammer to smash the window of his hotel room before opening fire on the concert crowd of some 22,000 people.Daesh described him as a ""soldier of the caliphate,"" saying he converted and went by the nom de guerre Abu Abdel Bar al-Amriki -- ""The American.""The group provided no evidence to back up its claims and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had found no such link so far.""We have determined to this point no connection with an international terrorist group,"" FBI special agent Aaron Rouse said.CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said ""the Intelligence Community is aware of the claim of responsibility by a foreign terrorist organization.""""We advise caution on jumping to conclusions before the facts are in,"" Liu said.Paddock, according to his brother, was a high-stakes gambler and their bank-robber father was once on the FBI´s 10 Most Wanted list.But Eric Paddock stressed that his brother led an otherwise normal life, doting on their mother.""He liked to play video poker. He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies,"" he said.""We´re trying to understand what happened,"" his brother said. ""We´re lost.""Paddock had ""no religious affiliation, no political affiliation"" and was ""not an avid gun guy at all,"" his brother added.Witnesses said Paddock opened fire with an initial long burst of gunfire, and appeared to reload as he continued his spree.Robert Hayes, a Los Angeles firefighter who was at the concert, said he first thought the shots were some kind of equipment malfunction.Once he realized what was going on, he joined the first responders, donning one of their vests.Police say they recovered a total of 34 weapons belonging to Paddock""It was pretty much like a war scene inside,"" Hayes said, as emergency crews used tables and metal guard railings as makeshift stretchers.The Las Vegas attack is the deadliest shooting in modern US history, exceeding the toll of 49 dead in an attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016.It was also the latest in a series of deadly attacks at concert venues.22 people were killed after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England in May when a suicide bomber detonated a nail bomb in the foyer.90 people were killed in November 2015 at the Bataclan theater in Paris during a concert by US band the Eagles of Death Metal.Pope Francis said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the ""senseless tragedy"" in Las Vegas, Britain´s Queen Elizabeth II offered her ""thoughts and prayers"" and Russian President Vladimir Putin wrote Trump to voice condolences over the ""shocking"" crime."
761,"KABUL: Such is Rashid Khan´s popularity that even a suicide blast at Kabul´s main cricket stadium couldn´t keep his fans away -- and the teenager is now eyeing the sport´s big prizes as his international profile grows.The 19-year-old leg spinner started playing with a tennis ball in the remote and poor province of Nangarhar, but he has now starred in the Indian Premier League and will soon make his debut in Australia´s Big Bash League.At last month´s Shpageeza Cricket League, Afghanistan´s Twenty20 domestic tournament, he became the youngest player to take 100 T20 wickets as he helped the Band-e-Amir Dragons to victory.Khan´s success has helped elevate cricket´s profile in Afghanistan, where most players were introduced to the sport in refugee camps in Pakistan after fleeing the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation.Even after a suicide bomber blew himself up within metres of the Kabul stadium, killing three people, Khan´s fans continued to flock to watch him play.They waved the Afghan national flag and chanted songs for Khan, some showing their devotion by painting his name on their bodies.""I play cricket to bring victories for my country and to make Afghanistan proud on the world stage,"" Khan told AFP in an interview in Kabul.This year, Khan became the first Afghan to play in the lucrative IPL, and he will also be the first from his country in the Big Bash League when he turns out for the Adelaide Strikers in December.Adelaide Strikers coach Jason Gillespie hailed Rashid´s signing as a ""major coup"" when it was announced last month.""Rashid has set the world alight in T20 cricket with his energy, enthusiasm, and great control for a young guy,"" Gillespie said. ""He has some great variations, can bowl stump-to-stump and can be very hard to pick.""Khan was born during the Taliban´s 1996-2001 rule, when sport was considered a distraction from religious studies.He learned cricket by studying the techniques of Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar and Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi on television, and then practising outside in the dirt with his brothers using a tennis ball.Khan, one of 12 children, began his professional career in Afghanistan´s domestic league where his deceptive bowling technique soon caught the attention of national selectors. At 17, he made his international debut against Zimbabwe. Since then Khan has been on a rollercoaster ride, taking 63 wickets in 29 one-day internationals, including the fourth best figures in one-day history -- seven for 18 against the West Indies in June.He is also the first bowler to take a hat-trick in the T20 Caribbean Premier League, when playing for the Guyana Amazon Warriors. ""Now I want to play against the world´s best and to challenge the best teams on their home turf,"" said Khan.Khan´s ascension to cricket poster boy in Afghanistan has coincided with the sport´s stunning revival in the country. Afghanistan was catapulted into the elite club of Test nations in June and made its landmark debut at Lord´s the following month. ""I want to bring Afghanistan the cricket World Cup -- this is the ultimate goal of my life,"" said Khan, a comment that may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Former England captain Adam Hollioake, who coached one of the six teams in Afghanistan´s domestic T20 tournament last month, believes the country ""could be top six in the world"" within a decade. ""I really believe the talent and passion is here in this country,"" Hollioake told AFP.Afghanistan Cricket Board chief executive Shafiqullah Stanekzai told AFP he was optimistic about the sport´s future in the country.Cricket is going ""from strength to strength"" and there are plans to build five international-standard stadiums over the next three years, he said.""We need five stadiums with capacity of between 15,000 and 30,000 as it is obvious that cricket is the number one sport and we have so many people coming to the grounds even in our domestic games,"" he said. As the Taliban insurgency marks its 16th anniversary, ethnic divisions deepen and civilian casualties rise, cricket could serve a greater purpose than just entertainment, said Khan.""I believe the game of cricket... is a binding force and brings many ethnic groups together and can restore peace and stability to Afghanistan,"" he said."
762,"MADRID: Barcelona and its members would have to decide which soccer league to play in if Catalonia gained independence from Spain, club president Josep Maria Bartomeu said on Monday.The Catalan club played behind closed doors at the Nou Camp on Sunday, beating Las Palmas 3-0 in La Liga, as a protest against Spain using force to prevent voters taking part in a banned referendum to decide the region’s fate.More than 840 people needed medical attention after riot police clashed with some of those attempting to participate in the controversial vote on secession, which the Spanish government had ruled illegal.“In the case of independence, the club and the members would have to decide in which league we would play,” Bartomeu told reporters after a board meeting.“We are going through difficult and complicated moments and with respect to what could happen in the future we will take it on with calm and wisdom.”Catalan sports minister Gerard Figueras last week said Barcelona may be able to play in another country should the region achieve independence from Spain.“In the case of independence, Catalan teams in La Liga – Barcelona, Espanyol and Girona – will have to decide where they want to play: in the Spanish league or a neighbouring country like Italy, France or the (English) Premier League,” he said.Bartomeu also said he had accepted the resignations of Barcelona vice-president Carles Vilarrubi and director Jordi Mones, who opposed the decision to play behind closed doors.“Today the board has accepted the resignation of vice-president Carles Vilarrubi and Barca Innovation Hub chief Jordi Mones,” he said.“We thank both of them for their dedication during all their years of service to the club.”Bartomeu said choosing to play without fans was one of the hardest decisions he has had to make as the club’s president, since taking over from Sandro Rosell in January 2014.”We perfectly understand that many of our members and fans would have preferred the option of calling off the match,“ said Bartomeu. ”That is why I must say that this was one of the most difficult decisions that I have ever had to make as Barca president.“We very seriously considered the option of postponing the game, but we could not get the Professional Football League (LFP) to approve our request,” he added referring to the national body that runs La Liga.“Having reached that point, I decided to play behind closed doors because we believed that the image of a football match being played in a completely empty Camp Nou would have been a responsible action and a way of showing how we utterly reject the exceptional and inadmissible situation going on around Catalonia.”Barcelona, Espanyol and Girona all announced on Monday that they would be joining a region-wide general strike in Catalonia on Tuesday, Oct. 3 following the weekend’s events."

764,"Manchester United’s injuries gives team mates the opportunity to prove their worth and flourish for the starting side, the Premier League club’s manager Jose Mourinho has said.Frenchman Paul Pogba is the latest to join United’s long-term injury list with a hamstring problem but the club have won five consecutive games without the playmaker, including Saturday’s 4-0 league win over bottom-side Crystal Palace.United have been dominant over the last five games, scoring 17 goals and conceding just two, and Mourinho is focused on the players on the pitch rather than those absent from it.“When we moan all the time about injuries it looks like we don’t trust the other people and we have to. We never miss the players that are injured, that’s our way of seeing,” Mourinho told British media.“They are injured, we don’t think about them. It’s an opportunity for others, is a moment for others to step up and to get the chance, so I think that’s good.”Pogba scored two goals and provided two assists in four league appearances before sustaining the injury and his midfield partner Nemanja Matic is confident that the 24-year-old will regain his form once he recovers.Matic also echoed his manager’s words, saying that United had “great players” that could help them win despite the absence of key players.Last year’s top-scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo are yet to return from serious knee injuries sustained last season, while midfielder Michael Carrick has missed the previous two games with a knock.Mourinho also said that it was too early to assess United’s title chances as they lie second in the league table, behind local rivals Manchester City on goal difference, after seven games.After the international break, United renew their fierce rivalry with Liverpool when they travel to Anfield on Oct. 14."
765,"Stephen Paddock appeared to be settling into a quiet life a few years ago when the 64-year-old apartment manager and avid gambler bought a home in a quiet Nevada retirement community about an hour’s drive from the Las Vegas Strip and his beloved casinos.Those who knew Paddock say there was no sign he was capable of holing up in a room on the 32nd floor of a casino hotel, the Mandalay Bay, and opening fire with multiple guns on a country music festival, killing at least 59 people and wounding more than 520 in the worst mass shooting in modern US history.“He was a wealthy guy and he liked to play video poker and he liked to go on cruises,” the gunman’s seemingly baffled brother Eric Paddock told reporters from his doorstep in Orlando, Florida, on Monday.“He’s never drawn his gun, it makes no sense,” Eric Paddock said. He said he was aware that his brother had a couple of handguns he kept in a safe, perhaps a long rifle, but no automatic weapons.Police say they recovered a total of 34 weapons belonging to Paddock, including 16 from the hotel room and 18 at his home in Mesquite, a small desert town popular with golfers and gamblers. Some were automatic weapons or semi-automatic rifles illegally modified into machine guns.Eric Paddock described his brother as peaceful, saying he moved back to the red desert hills of Nevada because gambling is legal there and he hated Central Florida’s humidity.Police identified the gunman as area resident Stephen PaddockPaddock apparently lived in Mesquite with his girlfriend, who was in Tokyo at the time of the shooting. Las Vegas police said they were seeking to interview her when she returned. Authorities said she had no connection with the attack.The brothers were last in touch in early September, exchanging text messages about power outages after Hurricane Irma slammed into Florida, where their mother still lives.“He had nothing to do with any political organisation and religious organizations”, Eric Paddock said.Their father was Patrick Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Most Wanted list in the 1960s and essentially unknown to his sons. The shooter himself had no criminal record, Las Vegas police said.In recent weeks, Paddock made gambling transactions worth tens of thousands of dollars, although it was unclear whether they were wins or losses, NBC News reported, citing unidentified law enforcement officials.Public records point to an itinerant existence across the American West and Southeast: Florida, a few years in California, a few years in other parts of Nevada.A spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin said Paddock worked for a predecessor of the company from 1985 to 1988, but offered no other details.Paddock had a hunting licence in Texas, where he lived for a while. He got his pilot licence and had at least one single-engine aircraft registered in his name.In early 2015, he bought a modest two-story home in a new housing development for retirees on the dusty edge of Mesquite, which straddles Nevada’s border with Arizona.“It’s a nice, clean home and nothing out of the ordinary,” Quinn Averett, a Mesquite police department spokesman, told reporters on Monday.The FBI said Paddock had no connection with international militant groups.Before moving to Mesquite, Nevada, he lived in another town called Mesquite, in Texas, where he worked as the manager of an apartment complex called Central Park. The Washington Post reported that Paddock had also worked as an accountant and had real estate investments.Records as recent as 2015 list Paddock as single, though it appears he may have married while living in California in the 1980s.Paddock’s age places him in the minority of mass shooters, said Laura Dugan, professor of criminology at the University of Maryland.“Most shooters are fairly young,” Dugan said. “Right now with this particular case, it’s baffling. Why would a guy in his 60s who seems to be well-off, go and do a thing like that?”"

768,"As qualifying for the 2018 World Cup reaches its climax, Lionel Messi's Argentina find themselves in trouble, Syria face a play-off to keep their remarkable dream alive and European champions Portugal have work to do.AFP Sport looks at the state of play in each of the regions:Brazil secured their place in next year's finals back in March, but three automatic berths remain up for grabs in South America ahead of the final two rounds of qualifying matches. Two-time World Cup champions Argentina haven't missed the tournament since 1970, but five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi and his compatriots, runners-up in Brazil three years ago, are currently languishing in fifth place.While that would not spell the end of the road for Argentina, instead sending them into a two-legged play-off against New Zealand, even that is far from assured with Copa America holders Chile lurking just a point behind in sixth.Europe will provide 14 of the 32 competing teams in Russia, the hosts included. But so far only Belgium have punched their ticket to the finals going into the last two sets of fixtures.World champions Germany, who need just a draw in Northern Ireland on Thursday, lead a handful of other sides who can wrap up qualification this week.England are five points clear in Group F, while Serbia are in control of their section and 2010 champions Spain have the edge over Italy in their two-horse race.The nine group winners progress automatically, while all but one of the runners-up advance to the play-off round to determine the final four qualifiers.Portugal, while sure of at least making the play-offs, face a critical final match at home to Switzerland as Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates look to overturn a three-point deficit in Group B.France hold a tentative one-point cushion over Sweden in Group A and will be all too aware of the dangers posed by a trip to Bulgaria, the country responsible for their absence at the 1994 World Cup.Five places are on offer in Africa, but none as yet have been claimed. Nigeria are closing in on a sixth World Cup appearance, with reigning continental champions Cameroon and Algeria out of the running in a challenging section, but Zambia could still deny the Super Eagles.Tunisia are well positioned to end a 12-year World Cup exile, leading nearest rivals the Democratic Republic of Congo by three points, while Egypt are in control of their destiny.But other groups remain wide open with just the first-place finishers qualifying for Russia. Ivory Coast top Group C on seven points, but both Morocco (six) and Gabon (five) still harbour genuine hopes.It is a similar situation in Group D after FIFA's decision to annul South Africa's 2-1 win over Senegal from November 2016 -- a match manipulated by a Ghanaian referee. Burkina Faso and Cape Verde head the pool on six points, but Senegal trail by just a point with their match against Bafana Bafana to be replayed in November.Iran, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia will represent Asia in Russia next year, but Syria and Australia will attempt to join them via the play-offs.Syria prolonged their fairytale World Cup campaign with a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser in their final group match to set up a double-header against Australia on October 5 and 10.The Socceroos are bidding for a fourth straight finals appearance while Syria, who have never reached the World Cup before, have kept their dream alive despite the brutal civil war that has forced them to play all their home games abroad.They will take on Australia in Malaysia in the first leg before travelling to Sydney for the return. The winner of the tie will meet the fourth-placed team from CONCACAF with a spot in Russia at stake.Mexico will compete at their seventh straight World Cup next summer, with Costa Rica also on the verge of direct qualification. But a third automatic berth is still in play, while the fourth-placed side can also qualify through the inter-continental play-offs.Panama, in third, lead the United States and Honduras by a single point with two rounds of games still to play."
769,"WASHINGTON: US Supreme Court justices on Monday expressed scepticism towards part of an immigration law requiring the deportation of immigrants who commit violent felonies because of uncertainty over which crimes fit the bill and which do not.The justices heard arguments in the government’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that language in the Immigration and Nationality Act calling for the deportation of legal immigrants convicted of a “crime of violence” was so vague that it violated their rights to due process of law under the US Constitution.The case involves a Filipino legal immigrant named James Garcia Dimaya who federal authorities ordered deported after he was convicted in two California home burglaries, though neither crime involved violence.The ruling in the case could help clarify the crimes for which non-citizen immigrants may be expelled, affecting the Trump administration’s policy of stepping up the removal of those with criminal records. There has been an intense focus on immigration issues since Republican President Donald Trump took office in January.Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee who joined the court in April, could cast the deciding vote.Monday’s arguments marked the second time the court has tried to tackle the case. It heard arguments in January when the nine-seat court was one justice short, but decided in June after Gorsuch brought the court to full strength to have the case re-argued.Several justices questioned the role of courts in judging certain crimes as violent. “Lots of burglaries are done with open doors or with jimmying without injuring a lock,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.Gorsuch told Trump administration lawyer Edwin Kneedler it was up to the US Congress to clearly specify who is covered by laws it passes “when it’s going to put people in prison and deprive them of liberty and result in deportation.”Kneedler said Congress had reasonably identified a category of crimes that carry the risk of violence, and suggested that the justices should defer to the immigration authorities.Conservative Justice Samuel Alito appeared to back the government, suggesting that too loose a standard for finding non-criminal laws vague might cause many other laws to fall. “We might do a wonderful job of pruning the United States Code,” he said, referring to the compilation of federal criminal and civil offences.Dimaya came to the United States from the Philippines as a legal permanent resident in 1992 at age 13. He lived with his family in the San Francisco Bay area, and had worked in several retail store jobs, including as a manager.He was convicted in residential burglaries in 2007 and 2009 in crimes in which no violence was used and no one was injured. He was sentenced to two years in prison for each conviction.In 2010, the government began a process to deport Dimaya. The Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest US administrative body for interpreting and applying immigration laws, refused to cancel his expulsion because the law involved defined burglary as a “crime of violence.”In the federal criminal code, a “crime of violence” includes offences in which force either was used or carried a “substantial risk” that it would be used.The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2015 that the definition as applied to non-citizen immigrants was unconstitutionally vague and can lead to arbitrary enforcement of the law.The appeals court relied on a decision that same year by the US Supreme Court, which found that a similar provision in a federal criminal sentencing law was overly broad.The case was argued on the first day of the court’s new term. A ruling is due by the end of June."

771,"LAS VEGAS: At least 59 people were killed and 527 injured when a gunman opened fire on concert-goers Sunday night in Las Vegas.Here's what we know about the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history:A crowd of more than 22,000 people was listening to country music star Jason Aldean at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when bursts of automatic gunfire erupted around 10:08 pm (0508 GMT).Police said the lone shooter opened fire with multiple weapons on concert-goers from his 32nd floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino across the street on the famed Las Vegas Strip.""People started grabbing their loved-ones and just strangers, and trying to help them get out of the way,"" said Ralph Rodriguez, IT consultant who was at the concert with a group of friends.Police identified the gunman as Stephen Craig Paddock, a wealthy retired former accountant from Mesquite, Nevada, around 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of Las Vegas.The sole suspect in the shooting, the 64-year-old Paddock killed himself in his hotel room as a police SWAT team was about to break in.Police recovered at least 16 rifles from his room, and later found a weapons cache including over 18 firearms, explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo at his home in Mesquite.A former accountant and a licensed private pilot, police said Paddock had had no known brushes with the law.Eric Paddock, the gunman´s elder brother, told local media he could not fathom what motivated him.Stephen Paddock regularly played high-stakes video poker but was wealthy and had ""no religious affiliation, no political affiliation,"" the brother said.Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said 59 people had been confirmed dead and 527 wounded.The toll could yet rise but the Las Vegas Strip shooting is already the deadliest ever in the United States, exceeding the toll of 49 killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016.In a televised address, Trump described the massacre as an ""act of pure evil"" but said it would not shatter the nation´s ""unity.""Trump refrained from addressing the unproven claim of responsibility from Daesh, or calls for gun control and the White House said it would be ""premature"" to reopen the US debate on tighter gun restrictions.Trump led White House staff and senior US officials in a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House, and announced he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday."
772,"Oil fell more than $1 a barrel on Monday as a rise in US drilling and higher OPEC output put the brakes on a rally that helped prices notch their biggest third-quarter gain in 13 years.Iraq announced its exports rose slightly in September while a Reuters survey showed OPEC overall boosted output. [OPEC/M]US drillers added six oil rigs in the week to Sept. 29, bringing the total count to 750, data from General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm showed on Friday.“We’ve seen them add rigs for the first time in seven weeks, so that changes sentiment as well,” said John Tjornehoj, energy market analyst at CHS Hedging.Brent crude LCOc1, the global benchmark, settled down 67 cents or 1.2 percent to $56.12 a barrel. It had notched a third-quarter gain of about 20 percent, the biggest increase for that quarter since 2004, and traded as high as $59.49 last week.US crude CLc1 closed down $1.09 or 2.1 percent to $50.58. The US benchmark posted its strongest quarterly gain since the second quarter of 2016.Oil prices climbed last week on tension in Iraqi Kurdistan after the region’s independence vote.“The big short-term risk is obviously the pipeline,” said James Williams, president of energy consultant WTRG Economics. “So far Turkey hasn’t closed the Kurdish pipeline.”The rally had also been driven by signs that a three-year crude glut is easing, helped by a production cut deal among global producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.But a Reuters survey on Friday found OPEC oil output rose last month, mostly because of higher production in Iraq and also Libya, an OPEC member exempt from cutting output.However, Libya’s National Oil Company in a letter on Monday declared force majeure on deliveries from Sharara, the country’s largest oilfield.Middle Eastern oil producers are concerned the price rise will stir US shale producers into more drilling and push prices lower again. Key OPEC producers consider a price above $60 as encouraging too much shale output.Hedge funds have accumulated a record bullish position in middle distillates such as diesel, heating oil and gas oil, anticipating stocks will be relatively tight this winter.“We’ve seen a run-up in heating oil futures, and I think that particular product has supported the rise of WTI,” said Tjornehoj, while noting that distillate prices fell on Monday. “As we reverse here lower we see the recent strong correlation continuing.”"

774,"MADRID: La Liga sides Barcelona, Espanyol and Girona have decided to join the general strike in Catalonia on Tuesday, Oct. 3.The strike, called by more than 40 unions and associations in the region under the umbrella organisation Table for Democracy, is due to police forcefully attempting to stop Catalonia’s independence referendum on Sunday, which was deemed illegal by the Spanish government.More than 840 people needed medical assistance following clashes with riot police in ugly scenes as part of Spain’s deepest constitutional crisis for decades.While many players from Barcelona’s first team will leave to join their national squads ahead of the upcoming international fixtures, the remaining players and club staff will not attend the training centre on Tuesday.“FC Barcelona joins the countrywide strike called for by the Table for Democracy and therefore the club will be closed tomorrow,” Barcelona tweeted on Monday.“None of the professional teams or the youth teams at FC Barcelona will train tomorrow at the Ciutat Esportiva.”There was an organised region-wide ‘standstill’ protest on Monday with workers across Catalonia stopping work for 15 minutes at midday, including employees at Barcelona club offices.Espanyol and Girona, also based in Catalonia, released statements on Monday declaring their intentions to join the general strike as well.In protest at the violent events on Sunday, Barcelona held their La Liga clash with Las Palmas behind closed doors, winning 3-0."
775,"LOS ANGELES: Three films are essentially tied at the top of the weekend box office, as of Sunday morning.Warner Bros. and New Line’s “It” appears to be back on top with $17.3 million (£12.9 million) from 3,917 locations. But Universal’s “American Made” and Fox’s “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” are trailing just behind with $17 million each. Since the numbers are so close, some studios are waiting until later in the day to make the official call. Meaning this one likely won’t be settled until Monday morning.What’s certain is that Sony’s remake of “Flatliners” is coming in below expectations. After getting killed by critics (0% on Rotten Tomatoes) the horror flick is opening to $6.7 million from 2,552 locations.“American Made” stars Tom Cruise as a commercial airline pilot who’s recruited by the CIA to fly reconnaissance missions over South America. A $17 million opening is modest for movie starring Cruise, but the studio is hoping for a long runway based on positive reviews and word of mouth. The movie has been earning money overseas for the past few weekends, giving it $64.7 million in international grosses so far. 55% of the domestic audience is male, and 56% is over the age of 30.“There were people out there who had us at a little less. It’s not a disappointment -- it’s an overachievement,” said Universal’s distribution chief Nick Carpou, who also addressed opening the film against so many others with R MPAA ratings. “I think that the rating of the film is secondary to the content of the film,” he said. “To me, it feels like a fall release.”If “It” returns to the top spot after taking second place to “Kingsman” last weekend, it would be a feat. The horror movie smashed records for the month of September when it opened and went on to become the highest grossing horror movie of all time. After this weekend, “It‘s” domestic total stands at $291.2 million.“The Lego Ninjago Movie,” from Warner Bros., looks to land in fourth ahead of “Flatliners” with $12 million from 4,047 locations. Fox Searchlight’s “Battle of the Sexes” expanded to 1,213 where it’s earning $3.4 million. The rest of the top ten is “American Assassin” ($3.3 million, 3,020 locations); “Home Again” ($1.8 million, 2,370); “Til Death Do Us Part” ($1.5 million, 562 locations); and “Mother!” ($1.5 million, 1,840)."

777,"NEW YORK: Fans of rocker Tom Petty poured out their grief Monday on reports he had died of a heart attack -- until it turned out that he hadn´t.The 66-year-old rocker appeared to have serious health problems, but his daughter angrily dismissed news organization´s reports that he had died.TMZ, the Los Angeles celebrity news site known for its scoops, first broke the story with news that Petty had been found unconscious at his home in Malibu on Sunday night.TMZ later reported that he had been taken off life support. CBS television, quoting an unnamed police source, soon afterward said definitively that the rocker had died.But the Los Angeles Police Department denied it was the source of the information. Writing on Twitter, the department said that ""initial information was inadvertently provided to some media sources.""""We apologize for any inconvenience in this reporting,"" it tweeted.Music magazine Rolling Stone, quoting CBS and TMZ, ran an obituary of Petty complete with a quote from rock legend Bob Dylan, who played with him in the former Traveling Wilburys supergroup.The rocker´s daughter, artist Annakim Violette Petty, flatly denied he was dead and lashed out at Rolling Stone.""How dare you report that my father has died just to get press because your articles and photos are so dated?"" she wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post along with an image of Tom Petty on a 1979 cover.But she suggested in other posts that her father was indeed facing health issues. She thanked well-wishers, saying, ""This has been the longest day of my life"" and writing, in a nod to the Black Lives Matter movement, ""Dad Lives Matter.""Representatives for Petty did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the coroner´s office said he had no information of Petty´s death, while a police official said the department would not normally comment on a death unless there were suggestions of foul play.The embarrassing mix-up brought stunned reactions to social media as well as some light-hearted remarks.""Leave it to Tom Petty to Not Back Down,"" screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer tweeted, referring to one of Petty´s best-known songs.Numerous fans and celebrities had already posted remembrances of Petty without any official word on his dead.""I loved Tom Petty and I covered his songs because I wanted know what it felt like to fly,"" tweeted singer John Mayer, quoting from his song ""Wildflowers"": ""You belong somewhere you feel free.""""You hang in there, Tom Petty. At least long enough to make it past this horrible day. You deserve a better sunset."" he later tweeted.Petty -- whose hits also include ""American Girl,"" ""Don´t Come Around Here No More"" and ""Free Fallin´"" -- just last week had wrapped up a tour to mark 40 years of his band the Heartbreakers.Born in Gainesville, Florida, Petty has infused his brand of rock ´n´ roll with Southern influences and a dark lyrical sense, with songs of small-town Americans striving but facing roadblocks."

781,"BERLIN: About 10,000 people in Berlin were forced to leave their homes on Monday as bomb disposal units prepared to defuse an unexploded World War II bomb.Construction workers found the 250-kilo device earlier in the day, prompting police to seal off the area within a 500-metre radius of the site in west Berlin´s Innsbrucker Platz.Underground and suburban rail traffic was disrupted, and officers went house to house to ensure that the area was cleared before disposal experts moved in.More than 70 years after the end of the war, unexploded ordnance is regularly found buried in Germany, a legacy of the intense bombing campaigns by Allied forces against Nazi Germany.At least 60,000 people were evacuated in central Frankfurt in September, the biggest operation of its kind in post-war Germany, after a 1.8-tonne British bomb nicknamed ""Wohnblockknacker"", or blockbuster, was discovered.In May, 50,000 residents were ordered out of their homes in the northern city of Hanover over several WWII-era bombs.And on Christmas Day 2016, the discovery of an unexploded 1.8-tonne British bomb prompted the evacuation of 54,000 people in the southern city of Augsburg."

Our bonds cannot be broken by violence. And though we feel such great anger at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today - and always will, forever.""But in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, that unity was difficult to find.Police have identified the heavily armed gunman behind the Sunday night massacre in Las Vegas - the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history which left more than 500 injured - as a 64-year-old Nevada resident named Stephen Craig Paddock.Paddock apparently killed himself before a SWAT team breached his hotel room overlooking the concert venue, recovering at least eight rifles.Trump's vanquished election rival Hillary Clinton hit out at the gun manufacturers lobby - the National Rifle Association - which has backed a congressional push to make it easier to obtain a gun silencer.""The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer,"" tweeted Clinton, whose Democratic Party has tried in vain to introduce lasting gun control measures despite the national scourge of mass shootings.""Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.""The issue of gun control is highly sensitive in the United States and Trump's own views on the issue have changed markedly over his years in public life.After the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, where 20 six and seven-year-old children and six adults were mowed down by a disturbed 20-year-old, Trump appeared to favor stricter rules.Back then, president Barack Obama - who often called Sandy Hook the worst moment of his eight-year presidency and recalls even his Secret Service detail in tears - called for the deadlock to be broken and for Congress to act.At that time Trump tweeted: ""President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown Connecticut.""But since then Trump - whose White House bid was eagerly endorsed by the NRA - has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the constitutional ""right to keep and bear arms.""US Senator Chris Murphy, who was the congressman for Sandy Hook, renewed a call for action in the wake of the Las Vegas attack.""Nowhere but America do horrific large-scale mass shootings happen with this degree of regularity,"" he said.""This must stop.

784,"LAS VEGAS: At least 58 people were killed and more than 515 injured when a gunman opened fire at a country music festival in Las Vegas Strip on Sunday, raining down bullets from the 32nd floor of a hotel for several minutes before he was shot dead by police.The death toll, which police emphasised was preliminary, would make the attack the deadliest mass shooting in US history, eclipsing last year’s massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub.Some 22,000 people were in the crowd when the man opened fire, sending panicked people fleeing the scene, in some cases trampling one another, as law enforcement officers scrambled to locate and kill the gunman. Shocked concert goers, some with blood on their clothes, wandered the streets after the attack.At least 406 people were taken to area hospitals with injuries, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said.Police identified the gunman as area resident Stephen Paddock, 64, and said they had no information yet about his motive.He was not believed to be connected to any militant group, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters.“We have no idea what his belief system was,” Lombardo said. “We’ve located numerous firearms within the room that he occupied.”Authorities had earlier regarded Paddock’s roommate, Marilou Danley, as a person of interest, but later on Monday said they no longer regarded her as related to the case, CNN and Fox News reported, citing police sources.Police had located two cars that belonged to the suspect.The dead included one off-duty police officer, while at least one other officer was critically injured, Lombardo said. Police warned the death toll may rise.Video taken of the attack showed panicked crowds fleeing as sustained rapid gunfire ripped through the area.“It sounded like fireworks. People were just dropping to the ground. It just kept going on,” said Steve Smith, a 45-year-old visitor from Phoenix, Arizona, who had flown in for the concert. He said the gunfire went on for an extended period of time.“Probably 100 shots at a time. It would sound like it was reloading and then it would go again,” Smith said. “People were shot and trying to get out. A lot of people were shot.”Las Vegas’s casinos, nightclubs and shopping draw some 3.5 million visitors from around the world each year and the area was packed with visitors when the shooting broke out shortly after 10 p.m. local time (0400 GMT).Mike McGarry, a 53-year-old financial adviser from Philadelphia, was at the concert when he heard hundreds of shots ring out.“It was crazy - I laid on top of the kids. They’re 20. I‘m 53. I lived a good life,” McGarry said. The back of his shirt bore footmarks, after people ran over him in the panicked crowd.The shooting broke out on the final night of the three-day Route 91 Harvest festival, a sold-out event attended by thousands and featuring top acts such as Eric Church, Sam Hunt and Jason Aldean.“Tonight has been beyond horrific,” Aldean said in a statement on Instagram. “It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.”The suspected shooter’s brother, Eric Paddock, said the family was stunned by the news.“We have no idea. We’re horrified. We’re bewildered and our condolences go out to the victims,” Eric Paddock said in a brief telephone interview, his voice trembling. “We have no idea in the world.”US President Donald Trump offered his condolences to the victims via a post on Twitter early Monday.“My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!” Trump said.Trump decried the massacre as an ""act of pure evil"", but refrained from addressing calls for gun control or an unproven claim of responsibility from Daesh.Delivering televised remarks from the White House, Trump ordered that flags be flown at half-staff until sunset Friday, offered prayers for the victims and announced he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.Trump did not address a Daesh propaganda agency´s unverified claim that one of its ""soldiers"" who had ""converted to Islam"" months ago was responsible.White House officials also refused to comment on that claim ""at this point"" saying the local authorities´ investigation was ""ongoing.""

785,"BEIRUT: Two suicide bombers struck a police station in Damascus on Monday, with at least 10 people reported dead, in the first such attack to hit the Syrian capital since July.The interior minister said the blasts killed “a number of policemen and civilians” in the al-Midan neighbourhood, but did not say how many.At least 10 people were killed and 20 more injured when four armed men assaulted the station, the pro-Damascus television channel al-Mayadeen reported. Russian news agency RIA put the toll at 15.Militants targeted the Al-Midan police station and clashed with police officers there, Interior Minister Mohammad al-Shaar said on state television from the station.One man blew himself up at the main entrance and another detonated his explosive device on the first floor, he said.There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Footage on state TV showed bodies in shrouds on the floor of the station and firefighters putting out flames.The capital has enjoyed relative security as Syria’s six-year civil war has raged on nearby and across the country. But several such attacks have hit Damascus in recent years, including a car bomb that killed 20 people in July.A bomb blast had also hit the same police station in Al-Midan late last year.Daesh and the Tahrir al-Sham alliance - led by fighters formerly linked to Al-Qaeda - have each claimed separate suicide attacks that killed scores of people in Damascus in the past.Monday’s attack came as a response to “the major victories that our armed forces are achieving on Syrian land,” the interior minister said.With the help of Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, the government has pushed back rebels in western Syria, shoring up its rule over the main urban centres. In recent months, it has also marched eastwards against Daesh.“It’s natural to expect that the terrorists will resort to acts like this ... but they are all desperate acts,” Shaar said. “Such operations are thwarted on a daily basis.”Syrian troops and allied forces have captured several suburbs of Damascus from rebel factions over the past year. The army and its allies are currently fighting insurgents in the Jobar and Ain Tarma districts on the capital’s eastern outskirts."

In a subsequent address to the media, the interior minister said Rangers are subordinate to his ministry.“They’re supposed to work under the command of the civil administration. If Rangers have refused to observe orders, a high-level inquiry will be held and we will see who has challenged the writ of the government,” he said. “A force that is subordinate to me has to follow my orders.

They are liabilities, I accept that they are liabilities. But give us time to get rid of these liabilities. You are increasing our liabilities further,"" said Asif.""Don't blame us for Haqqanis, don't blame us for Hafiz Saeeds. These were the people who were your darlings....20 or 30 years back.

She died in 2012 aged 48, after drowning in a hotel bathtub.“Her death was so startling and unexpected – there is that analogy when someone dear to you, and it brought back the loss of my parents - how you can be affected by this tragedy,” he told Reuters.“The film does make clear that I might have been a little bit more vigilant earlier. But once I became aware of the seriousness of Whitney’s addiction, I acted,” he added.The documentary ranges further over his career, with interviews with other artists he worked with from Aretha Franklin and Alicia Keys to Sean “Puffy” Combs, Patti Smith and Paul Simon.He was there in the early days of rap, financing the LaFace and Bad Boy labels which launched the careers of some of the first artists to attain mainstream success, such as Notorious B.I.G. and Combs.Davis said Combs convinced him that they could convince mainstream audiences to embrace hip-hop. “He was very articulate in expressing that vision and I bought into it,” Davis said.“Clive Davis: The Soundtrack To Our Lives,” is released on Oct. 3 via the Apple Music streaming service."

Participants were followed for six years.About one in four ate a high-energy breakfast, which included 20 per cent or more of the day's calories.Most people in the study - 70 percent - ate a low-energy breakfast that gave them five to 20pc of their daily calorie intake.Three percent said they skipped breakfast altogether or ate very little. This group ""tended to have more generally unhealthy eating habits and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors,"" said the report.People who skipped breakfast also ""had the greatest waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood lipids and fasting glucose levels,"" it said.Researchers used ultrasound technology to scan participants for signs of fatty deposits in the arteries, or early evidence of disease.They found that people who ate less than five percent of their recommended daily calories at breakfast had, on average, double the amount of fatty buildup in the arteries as people who ate a high-energy breakfast.This heightened risk of hardened arteries among people who skipped breakfast or ate little to start the day appeared independently of other factors, such as smoking, high cholesterol and physical inactivity.Previous studies have shown that eating a healthy breakfast is linked to good health, including a lower body weight, healthy diet, and lower risk of problems with cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes.Skipping breakfast has also previously been shown to raise the risk of coronary artery disease.According to Prakash Deedwania, professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and author of an accompanying editorial in the journal, the study offers more evidence that skipping breakfast can be harmful to one´s health.""Although breakfast skippers are generally attempting to lose weight, they often end up eating more and unhealthy foods later in the day. Skipping breakfast can cause hormonal imbalances and alter circadian rhythms,"" said Deedwania.""That breakfast is the most important meal of the day has been proven right in light of this evidence."""

794,"PARIS: Messing with your body's clock is dangerous business, in fact it could make you sick - or worse.The inner timekeeper dubbed the ""circadian clock"", governs the day-night cycle that guides sleep and eating patterns, hormones, and even body temperature.It is important enough that the Nobel Medicine Prize was awarded on Monday to three US scientists whose work illuminated the fundamentals of how it ticks.The trio identified genes that regulate the clock, and the mechanism by which light can synchronise it.Yet humans have a long history of overriding the circadian-driven need for sleep, Russell Foster, a professor of circadian neuroscience at Oxford University told AFP - the most obvious example being night work.Such tinkering with Mother Nature can have serious consequences ranging from impulsive behaviour to life-threatening conditions such as obesity and cancer, the experts say.Just look at the poor health records of shift workers such as nurses or factory labourers.The World Health Organization has already raised the red flag, with a 2007 report noting that ""circadian disruption"" is ""probably carcinogenic"" -- which means cancer-causing.The trouble is that the human body never really adapts to operating outside the normal cycle of working by day, and sleeping at night.Like everyone else, shift workers´ biological clocks are set by the rising and setting of the Sun - not their work schedule.""There is no medicine in the world that allows you to... speed up or slow down your body clock,"" said Claude Gronfier, a neurobiologist at France´s Inserm research institute.When workers force themselves to stay awake, it triggers the release of stress hormones such as cortisol - the same one that rushes into your blood in a life-or-death situation.The chemicals may keep you on your feet, but they are a bargain with the devil.For example, cortisol works to suppress the immune system and in the long run can make you more susceptible to a range of illnesses, including cancer.Such a lifestyle also opens one up to eat outside of normal times, when the body's metabolism might be lower and the calories are more likely to be converted into fat instead of being burnt up.""You're raising your heart rate, raising your blood pressure and insulin levels at a time that you would not ordinarily do that,"" Hugh Piggins, a neuroscience professor at the University of Manchester, told AFP.""Your body is basically not ready for it and you're giving it a bit of an insult.""Even short-term disruptions of the circadian clock can wreak havoc with your body. Just think jet lag.Flying from Paris to Los Angeles deposits travellers nine hours earlier in time, upending eating and sleeping patterns.The results can be blunted interaction with the world and a lack of empathy, complex thinking, or even clear memories.In such a state, people can do ""overly impulsive things - jump the red traffic light and fail to see the consequences of actions,"" explained Foster.A better understanding of the workings of the body clock has opened up a fascinating field of the scientific quest.Circadian dysfunction has been linked to depression, bipolar disorder, cognitive function, memory formation and even some neurological diseases.Over the past two decades, scientists have been studying how the timing of administering a medicine can impact how well it works.Already they have found that changing the timing can reduce the toxicity of some compounds.""Now we are moving to the exciting stage where we can start translating some of this knowledge into understanding what happens when these systems go wrong and more importantly to develop new therapeutic interventions,"" Foster said."

I am not a child, I have been in politics for more than 50 years,” he said. ""The Prime Minister house should have immediately ordered an inquiry after receiving the report.

I will call DG IB. This is a sub-judice matter,” the speaker directed Pirzada.Earlier, the federal government took notice of the memo and announced that it would file a case in Islamabad's Secretariat police station.The government also advised Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to take strict action against apparently mala fide reporting.The IB has also issued a formal denial of any such report or list. “Intelligence Bureau, premier national intelligence agency, is fully committed to safeguarding national interest and security of the country. Its officers/officials are working round the clock throughout the length and breadth of the country, facing all kinds of risks emerging in the line of duty,” a senior IB official had said on Sept 27, responding to a TV programme which alleged the agency had prepared a report regarding links of 37 parliamentarians with defunct sectarian and militant organizations.

809,"CARTAGENA: Arleth Martinez smooths her clothes, kisses a photo of her twins and leaves for work. It´s only a few meters from her Colombian cell to her unusually fragrant workplace, South America´s first gastronomic prison restaurant.Following the example of South Africa´s Pollsmoor Prison, where Nelson Mandela wound down his 27-year sentence, and another in Milan, inmates at the teeming women's prison in downtown Cartagena are getting a taste for reintegration back into society with an experience that mixes cuisine with customer service.The photo of the seven-year-old twins is Arleth's ""lucky charm"" -- a constant reminder of the future.Sentenced to six years for extortion in 2015, present-day life in the San Diego prison has become a little more palatable since she started working at the restaurant late last year.""Even though I'm still in prison, I feel free because it's a completely different environment,"" said the 26-year-old, wearing a pristine black t-shirt and apron, her hair gathered in a colorful pink turban. At least around the restaurant ""you don´t see so many bars"".Fifteen of the 150 inmates, most of them accused of murder or drug trafficking, work either in the kitchen, or in table service. The work is incentivised -- two days washing dishes, preparing or serving food, gets a day of prison time reduced.A fuchsia curtain separates the 50-seat restaurant from the cells. A mural of flowers painted by the inmates provides some colourful relief from the drab prison surroundings.Named ""El Interno,"" which roughly translates as ""The Intern,"" the eatery provides a little extra frisson for curious locals and tourists while they enjoy a 30-dollar menu that runs from ""fish ceviche in coconut milk"" to ""rice with seafood"" and ""posta Cartagenera"" -- meat in black sauce typical of the city.""When they arrive, people know that they are entering a prison and that they will be served by prisoners,"" said Johana Bahamon, a Colombian television actress whose Accion Interna (Internal Action) Foundation was the driving force behind the idea.""When they leave, they are happy to have met talented, courageous and real human beings,"" Bahamon told AFP.El Interno is a rare opportunity for inmates in a country that has the largest prison population in South America after Brazil.In the last 17 years, the number of those behind bars in Colombia has more than doubled from 51,500 to 119,000, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).Tougher sentences and an increase in convictions for drug trafficking have filled Colombia´s 138 prisons to well beyond their combined 80,000 capacity.Bahamon believes that women in these overcrowded prisons badly need to be offered a fresh start.It´s a recurring theme at the restaurant.""Yo creo en las segundas oportunidades"" (I believe in second chances) is emblazoned on Arleth´s black T-shirt and inscribed on the signs on the walls pointing to the colourful eatery.Bahamon said she was inspired by InGalera, a public restaurant run by Italian prisoners which set up in the parking lot of a Milan prison a few years ago.She convinced the authorities to adopt the concept to the San Diego prison, located right in the tourist heart of Cartagena, a few meters from the luxurious hotels that abound around the old Colonial city´s historic port.For well-to-do customers like Antonio Galan, from the capital Bogota, ""everything has a flavour and aroma of freedom, from the taste of the dishes to the ambience of the restaurant.""Thus, in the evenings at least, Arleth is surrounded by well-heeled influencers, personalities and media officials, who stand in solidarity with the cause.El Interno offers gourmet dinners from Tuesday to Sunday. But when it closes at 11:00 pm, it´s back to the mundane reality of answering roll call in their prison cells for Arleth and her fellow inmates.Like other prisons in Colombia, San Diego is overcrowded. Some 150 women, many of whom are awaiting trial, share a space designed for just 100.When she came to San Diego, Arleth said she got the shock of her life, as she had to come to terms with the prison drug abuse, poor hygiene, and a dilapidated building.For four months she slept on the floor, 25 to a cell. She was anxious for her children, entrusted to their grandmother. Their father, she says, mistreated and abandoned his family.But last year she passed her secondary school exams and trained as a waitress in the prison. Her work at the restaurant has earned her the right to a rare luxury here -- a bunk in a cell.In prison, ""only warriors"" survive, she said. "

811,"LONDON: It was meant to be the speech that rescued Theresa May’s premiership, but her public humiliation before the assembled Conservative Party has thrust her own future into doubt.And, just as she tries to revive Brexit talks.May’s authority was already shattered by her botched bet on a June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament just days before the opening of formal Brexit talks with the European Union.But her survival has been dependent on the absence of an obvious successor who could unite the split party around Brexit and fear of an election that many Conservatives think would let opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power.Comedian Lee Nelson, whose real name is Simon Brodkin, walked up to the stage and gave May the form“I don’t think anybody wants May to stay because they particularly want her as PM: I think lots of people want her to stay because the time is not yet right for what they want to happen next,” said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College London, who attended the party conference.""All they are talking about behind the scenes is whether she stays or goes, and that is a massive distraction as the UK faces this unprecedented challenge of Brexit."" (Graphics on 'Tracking the Brexit effect' - here)Even after the speech, there is no obvious successor because of rivalries and divisions. Those most often mentioned, however, are ministers Boris Johnson, foreign affairs; Philip Hammond, finance; Amber Rudd, interior; and David Davis, Brexit.But as Conservative lawmakers decide whether to proceed with May, Britain has just over one year to negotiate the terms of the EU divorce and the outlines of the future relationship. It is due to leave in late March 2019.If May stays, Brexit talks will be guided by one of the weakest leaders in recent British history. But if May goes, Britain would be thrust into another political crisis while the clock ticks down to Brexit.Many business leaders -- in Britain and the EU -- now fear a disorderly exit that would imperil Britain’s $2.5 trillion economy, shock global financial markets and undermine London’s position as the only financial centre to rival New York.“Yesterday was humiliating for May,” said one EU diplomat. “The whole country, the public mood in Britain is completely from a different planet. The whole island took off and is orbiting in their own galaxy. How can you turn this around?”In one of the most bizarre British political speeches in a generation, May speech to her annual conference was ruined by a comedian handing her a bogus employment termination letter “signed” rival Johnson, by repeated coughing fits and even by letters falling off the slogans on the set behind her.May battled on to finish the speech and was greeted by applause in the hall and a hug from her own husband, Philip, who bounded onto the stage to embrace her.Immediately after the speech, her spokesman said she was happy with the way it had gone. But the British media were less enthusiastic.“May on the final warning after speech shambles,” The Times front page headline said. The Guardian said: “Coughing and spluttering - May’s British dream turns into nightmare”, while the i said: “Last gasp”.The Sun, Britain’s most popular newspaper, compared the party to the 1970s television classic “Fawlty Towers” in which Monty Python star John Cleese plays Basil who runs a shambolic hotel while complaining about foreigners.“Like the sign outside Fawlty Towers, the missing letters behind Theresa May are an emblem of a tragicomic farce. Who needs Basil’s hotel? We now have the Tory Party,” The Sun said in an editorial.“This entire party has come unstuck.”Business minister Greg Clark said the Conservatives should stay cool-headed and praised May for showing guts and grace by coping with the interruptions to her speech. Spokesmen for both Downing Street and the Conservative Party declined to comment.Many Conservative activists fear another leadership contest will exacerbate the divide in the party over Europe, an issue which helped sink the last three Conservative prime ministers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.And many worry that a leadership contest would pave the way for an election victory by Labour’s Corbyn, who they cast as a Marxist seeking to impose a socialist fantasy on Britain.While Johnson is popular with some activists, the leader of the left campaign in the 2016 referendum would not get the support of many Brexit opponents in the parliamentary party. Some lawmakers want a younger generation to take over but feel that no single candidate from their group is yet ready.One Conservative activist said there was a one in three chance of a leadership challenge by the end of the year. For a challenge, 48 Conservative lawmakers need to write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee asking for a confidence vote.The problem for May, the activist said on the condition of anonymity, was that the media will now focus on every slight mishap to cast her as a flawed leader.“I‘m finding it increasingly difficult to see a way forward at the moment and it worries me,” Conservative lawmaker Ed Vaizey told the BBC."
812,"RAWALPINDI: Director-General Inter-Services Public Relation Major General Asif Ghafoor said on Thursday that there are no terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. ""There are no organised bases of any terrorist organisations in the country anymore.""""More than 50 per cent of Afghan territory is out of their control, which is also affecting Pakistan,"" said the DG ISPR while explaining that attacks in the country originate out of Afghanistan. Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor accepted that there are threats to Pakistan's borders, but added that the important question to ask is if the threat is by state or non-state actors. He added that Afghanistan has been at war for four decades and after 9/11 the war entered Pakistan. In regards to the issue of Rangers deployment at the accountability court on Monday, he said Rangers are under the Ministry of Interior.""Three wings of Rangers were deployed under Article 147. Once this happened, there is local coordination and this has been in practice since 2014,"" said Ghafoor.""A soldier who is deployed is doing his duty and if he is told not to allow irrelevant people....it is possible that someone who did not have a card was a relevant person. Even if the army chief does not have the necessary pass, he is informed by the personnel on duty that he is not allowed.""He added that the personnel performing their duty should be appreciated.""Any type of instability, whether political or economic, can not be in the country's interest and needs to be resolved."" Ghafoor said that the western border is being fenced while forts and posts have been built. ""The border will be further strengthened in the coming years,"" said DG ISPR.He explained that some of the troops deployed on the western border, which number around 200,000, have been rotated back to cantonments as the situation has improved significantly on the Pakistani side of the border. ""The border also extends to Iran and we are also improving border security there."" He stated that security operations conducted in the border regions are not against the people, state or the armed forces of Iran or Afghanistan, but are against non-state actors. ""Our border also meets Iran. It is important to mention that our deployment is not against Iran or Afghanistan but against non-state actors.""Ghafoor said Pakistan has ongoing coordination and contact with Tehran. ""The army chief will soon visit Iran to improve relations,"" he said.Referring to the eastern border with India, Maj Gen Ghafoor said the border is ""unsafe because of India's inappropriate reactions"".Talking about the increasing number of ceasefire violations by Indian forces, Ghafoor said the current year has witnessed the highest number of violations when compared to previous years. He added India has paid a price for firing incidents and will continue to do so if India does not act with restraint.""Threats from India are perpetual. We are a peaceful country and we do not want war with them, but we will defend ourselves fully and have the capability to do so.""""Unlike India, we cannot fire indiscriminately as there are Kashmiri brothers on the other side as well, so when there are casualties on that side, it is soldiers and infrastructure. But war is not the solution, so we are talking to them at all levels to stop this.""Referring to the ongoing Operation Raadul Fasaad, Maj Gen Ghafoor said it is being conducted successfully and intelligence based operations will continue in the country.""There was a huge security risk during Muharram. After many years, Muharram passed peacefully in Pakistan,"" said Ghafoor. Elaborating further, he said two suicide bombers, along with their handler, were arrested in Karachi and a car bomb was recovered from Quetta. He also spoke of a Bohra community gathering in Karachi which saw 21,000 foreigners participating, including 12,000 Indian citizens.""This event was also conducted successfully."" Referring to the World XI match and the cricket match in Miranshah, he said both were also conducted successfully and in the coming days, there would be a hockey match in Karachi. ""There were thousands of people watching the match in Miramshah and that would not have been possible if there were security threats.""During the press conference, Maj Gen Ghafoor said not a single country has faced the threats that faced Pakistan in 2008 and 2009.""There are no other countries like Pakistan, as all other countries who faced such problems either collapsed or had to have foreign armies take control. This is why you will hear the narrative that the Pakistan Army and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are not in anyone's control,"" said DG ISPR while referring to recent media reports that ISI officials had ties to militant groups. ""The target of the hostile narrative is the power which stopped them, hence you will hear the narrative that the Pakistan Army and ISI are not in control.""Maj Gen Ghafoor said there are four hostile agencies planning to conduct terror activities in Pakistan, and the same has been shared with the Foreign Office. ""We have to take this war to its logical conclusion. If our resolve stays strong, then nothing can happen in Pakistan. Even now, we have intelligence about four agencies working against us."" He added that Pakistan has come a long way and the country is moving towards a peaceful Pakistan. ""ISAF could never have succeeded without us,"" said the army spokesman. The spokesman was asked why there was no press release following the special corps commanders conference recently held at GHQ, he said, ""Silence is also an expression""."

817,"DAKAR/BAMAKO: Five soldiers from Niger and three US Army Special Forces troops were killed and two wounded in an ambush on a joint patrol in southwest Niger on Wednesday, according to Nigerien and US officials.The five Green Berets were attacked while on a routine patrol in an area known to have a presence of insurgents, including from al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Daesh, a US official told Reuters.It was unclear who fired on the US and US-backed forces, the official said. Those forces were not patrolling the area with any specific objective, such as a high-value target or rescuing a hostage, the official added.A spokesman for US Africa Command confirmed the attack after Radio France International (RFI) reported a lethal ambush near the Niger/Mali border.“We can confirm reports that a joint US and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger,” said the spokesman.Namatta Abubacar, an official for the region of Tillaberi in Niger, said five Nigerien soldiers were among the dead.A Niger diplomatic source said the attackers had come from Mali and had killed several soldiers, without saying whether any of the US troops stationed in the West African country were among the victims.US President Donald Trump was briefed by telephone on the attack by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly while Trump flew back on Air Force One from Las Vegas, where he had been visiting victims and first responders affected by Sunday’s mass shooting.RFI said earlier on Wednesday a counter-attack was underway.African security forces backed by Western troops are stepping up efforts to counter jihadist groups forming part of a growing regional insurgency in the poor, sparsely populated deserts of the Sahel.A relatively new militant group called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara has claimed some of the attacks.Geoff D Porter, head of North Africa Risk Consulting, said that any confirmation of Daesh's role in Wednesday’s strike would lead to a strategic shift from Libya toward the Sahel band, stretching eastwards from Senegal to Chad.“The emphasis ... will now shift south,” he said.The US Africa Command has hundreds of soldiers deployed across the region, including at an air facility in Agadez, and offers training and support to Niger’s army in aspects such as intelligence gathering and surveillance."

So the grandeur, the beauty, and the determination of everyone involved in the preparation is a new experience for all,” Tonthong Chandransu, a public relations official for the funeral organization committee and an expert on the Thai monarchy, told Reuters in an interview.“From the architecture, the craftsmanship, the various preparations and their fine details, I have never seen this sort of dedication.”Builders have been working for months on a royal crematorium that was built from scratch on a green in front of the palace.“Time was needed in order to build heaven, based on imagination and belief systems that fused Buddhism with Brahmin Hindu traditions that are important in Thai society,” Tonthong said.The palace has said it expects 250,000 mourners to attend the royal cremation.Thailand’s tourism body has asked tourists to respect Thai sensitivities during what promises to be an emotionally-charged time."

824,"LONDON: Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been stripped of a human rights award by the City of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate, as British institutions increasingly distance themselves from the beleaguered former rights icon.Oxford City Council voted unanimously this week to recommend Suu Kyi’s Freedom of the City award be withdrawn, citing deep concerns over the treatment of Rohingya Muslims under her watch.The city’s reputation is “tarnished by honoring those who turn a blind eye to violence,” local councilor and Labour party member Mary Clarkson said in a speech proposing the motion.Over 500,000 members of Myanmar’s Rohingya minority have fled across the border to Bangladesh since late August, when Rohingya attacks led to a violent crackdown by the army.Myanmar’s de facto leader Suu Kyi, previously renowned for her human rights activism, has been widely criticized for her silence on the subject.“While the UN calls the situation a ‘textbook example of ethnic cleansing’, Aung San Suu Kyi denies any ethnic cleansing and dismisses numerous claims of sexual violence against Rohingya women as ‘fake rape,'” Clarkson said.In a speech in late September, her first public statement on the subject since the exodus of refugees began, Suu Kyi said her government condemned all human rights violations and promised to punish perpetrators.But she did not address accusations of ethnic cleansing and did not criticize the army’s actions. Her speech was described as “little more than a mix of untruths and victim-blaming” by Amnesty International director for the region, James Gomez.The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar has seen more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims flee to neighbouring BangladeshA similar Freedom of the City award is being considered for withdrawal by Sheffield city council in the north of England, after residents submitted a petition last month.The award will likely be reviewed by councillors this month, the council’s democratic services team, which handles petitions, told Reuters.Oxford University college St Hugh‘s, Suu Kyi’s alma mater, removed her portrait last week from public display while Unison, Britain’s second-largest trade union, announced last month it would suspend her honorary membership."
825,"KARACHI: Fear ripples across the metropolis and the culprit remains at large, a day after a fresh wave of knife attacks left five women injured within a span of mere three hours in different parts of the city. Mystery continues to surround the attacker, who has managed to evade capture even after 14 knife attacks in the past nine days. The attacks on women were, at first, restricted to the Gulistan-e-Jauhar area but spread to Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Dalmia and other localities on Wednesday, spreading a renewed wave of terror across Karachiites. Investigative authorities remain baffled about the identity and motive of the attacker. Some officials contend the assailant is ‘mentally disturbed’ whereas some believe the attacker is part of an organised group. The latest attack took place at Gulshan Chowrangi on Wednesday, in which a 12-year-old girl was assaulted with a knife.The incidents occur over a span of three hours in Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Gulshan-e-Iqbal areas and surroundingsLater the same day, the attacker first targeted a woman in the city's Gulshan-e-Jamal area, followed by another attack near Dalmia road, police said.Within an hour of the two attacks, another woman — a student of Federal Urdu University of Arts Science and Technology — was attacked in NIPA Chowrangi vicinity.Over the next couple of hours, the assailant stabbed a 13-year-old girl in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area.Some similarities have been noticed across all the incidents: the attacker reportedly attacks with his left hand using a sharp object, wears a helmet and rides a red motorcycle.Karachi Police released pictures and CCTV footage of the suspect last week, wherein the assailant can be seen riding a motorcycle moments before attacking one of the victims. ""The suspect appears to be a thin man, aged 20-29,"" DIG East Sultan Khawaja said, adding that ""he appears to be 5 feet, 7-9 inches tall"" and usually rides a red motorcycle.Following the renewed spate of attacks, Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah slammed the police for failing to arrest the suspect and directed IG Police to arrest the attacker immediately.PPP chairman orders arrest of the culpritsPakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also took notice of the knife attacks on women and ordered immediate arrest of the culprits involved.“PPP will not tolerate [these] attacks on innocent women.

826,"WASHINGTON: The US budget deficit is proving to be a major obstacle to the tax reform plan being offered by President Donald Trump and top congressional Republicans, with one leading Senate hawk saying a week after the plan was introduced that any enlarging of the fiscal gap could kill his support.From proposed infrastructure enhancements to a military build-up, the deficit long ago put the brakes on major new federal spending programs; now Trump’s tax-cut proposal is threatened.“It looks to me like the administration’s already running for the hills. It looks to me like some of the tax-writing chairmen are already running for the hills ... I’m disheartened by the lack of intestinal fortitude I’m seeing,” Sen. Bob Corker said.The main problem is that the federal government is swimming in red ink with an annual deficit of $550 billion and a national debt -- the accumulation of past deficits and interest due to lenders to the U.S. Treasury -- exceeding $20 trillion.The Republican tax plan unveiled last week calls for as much as $6 trillion in tax cuts that would sharply reduce federal revenues. No commensurate spending cuts have been proposed. So, on their own, the tax cuts being sought by Trump would hugely expand the deficit and add to the debt.The administration has said two things must happen for the revenue losses to be offset. One is for economic growth to generate new tax revenues. Forecasts for that vary, with Republicans projecting much stronger economic growth and unusually large revenue gains resulting from tax cuts.“While policymakers are gearing up to address tax reform this fall, some have advocated for abandoning true reform and instead focusing solely on tax cuts. To combat arguments that such cuts will balloon the national debt, tax cut advocates have argued that the cuts could pay for themselves, largely through faster economic growth,” said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington balanced-budget advocacy group.“However, this claim is false,” the group said in a statement.The other way to prevent expanding the deficit is for the U.S. Congress to find new revenues for the government by closing certain tax breaks to offset Trump’s proposed deep tax cuts for corporations, small businesses and wealthy Americans.At least $4 trillion in new revenue needs to be raised this way, said lawmakers, but every tax break on the federal books has a special interest protecting it and that is a challenge.For example, Republicans proposed ending or limiting the individual tax deduction for state and local income taxes paid. Closing the tax break would bring in $1.3 trillion in revenues.But high-tax states would be hit harder than low-tax states by such a move. Lawmakers in New York and California, which have among the highest state tax levels in the country, were resisting the proposal to repeal the deduction, eroding support for the plan, even among Republicans, said lawmakers and aides.Corker has vowed that he will not support a tax plan that adds to the federal deficit. As a result, he is firm about what needs to be done to win his support for tax cuts.“There’s no way to do permanent tax reform, no way, without … loophole closing,” said the Tennessee Republican, who announced recently that he will not run for reelection in November 2018.Analysts said the $20 trillion national debt is already on an unsustainable upward path as the government pays for the medical and retirement costs of the aging Baby Boom generation.That would worsen if rising government debt undermined future economic growth by pushing interest rates higher and choking off private sector access to credit, they said.An administration official said the White House is inclined to let Congress lead on the state and local tax deduction.House and Senate Republicans need to agree on a budget resolution if they intend to pass a tax bill before January and without broad bipartisan support from Democrats. The House was set to vote on its version of a budget resolution on Thursday."

Now, the Sri Lankan batting coach realises his team would be heading into uncharted territory on Friday.“But it is something new to us and everyone is looking forward to this match,” he added.Referring to Pakistan’s pink ball match against West Indies in Dubai last year, Tillakaratne said the pink ball had neither supported the bowlers nor the track. “We watched the match Pakistan played against West Indies, and the ball did not do much and it was a good batting track,” he noted.Replying to a question, the coach told Geo News that Pakistan will miss the duo of Misbah and Younis but the team had plenty of good players.“Misbah and Younis were great servants of Pakistan cricket and we always respect them,” he said. “I am sure there are enough good players and Pakistan will find the right solution.”"
829,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed amendments to the Election Bill 2017, restoring a Khatm-i-Naboowat (finality of prophethood) declaration required to be signed by public office holders to its original form.The controversy had arisen when the ruling party had passed amendments to the election law earlier this week, with opposition parties claiming the bill moved by the government had also changed the contents of a form regarding belief in Khatm-i-Naboowat (finality of Prophethood), which is required to be signed by public office holders and election candidates. The amendments passed today were agreed upon by members of parliamentary parties after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had accepted the government had made a 'clerical error' and invited them to discuss the matter in his chambers. During the meeting, the parliamentary leaders agreed to restore the declaration to the original form it was in before the National Assembly passed the Elections Bill 2017 on Tuesday. Law Minister Hamid also addressed the House today, saying that a historical bill was passed recently, although now it has been amended.The declaration should have been left intact, said Hamid, adding that the change was inadvertent.The law minister said that the law has been restored to its earlier form, containing the affidavit required to be signed by public office-holders and election candidates.“This bill is a result of three years of hard work,” Zahid Hamid said, adding that the all the parliamentary and sub-committees were present.On Wednesday, speaking at a press conference along with the parliamentary party leaders following the meeting in his chambers, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said: “It is a clerical error. There is no big deal to make a correction on any wrong, the nomination paper will be restored in its original form.”Representing the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in the press conference, law minister Zahid Hamid had confirmed that the oath would be restored to its original form.The National Assembly had passed the Elections Bill 2017 on Tuesday, with several amendments including one paving the way for ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif to become the president of his political party once again. "
830,"It was the perfect setting. We had gathered on the historic occasion of the contract-signing for the construction of the 1,263 MW RLNG-fuelled Punjab Power Plant. The initiative will be wholly financed by the Punjab government out of its own resources and is the fourth largest gas-powered project that is being launched after the successful commissioning of the first phase of the Bhikki, Haveli Bahadur Shah and Balloki power plants of 3,600 MW cumulative capacity.I took this opportunity to tell the amazing story of Pakistan – a story of the hard work, resilience and unmatched talent of our people. I wanted to tell the world how resolutely and professionally the PML-N government took on the challenge of massive power outages that had inflicted heavy losses on our economy, industry, agriculture and domestic households during the past 15 years.Since the government took over four years ago, we have witnessed the speed at which work on the energy sector projects has been undertaken. The days and nights spent in thinking of ways and means to put an end to this chronic problem has enabled the government to arrest this serious challenge. By the end of this year or early next year, loadshedding will leave Pakistan forever.The signing of the contract for the Punjab Power Plant represents a gigantic step forward in our efforts to drive a nail in the coffin of the energy crisis. This project is geared towards meeting the electricity demands of our industry, agriculture and economy. The power projects currently underway across the country and the megawatts that have either been added to the national grid – or are in the process of being added – are just enough to meet our current demands. But for various reasons – such as the needs for repair, the maintenance of the plants, the replacement of old and inefficient plants and the expanding electricity requirements of our economy – it is wiser to have surplus power available in our system for a stop-gap arrangement.Around 810 MW from the 1,263 MW Punjab Power Plant will be commissioned to the national grid in 14 months from the date that the contract is signed while the entire project will come online in 26 months altogether.Despite all the hurdles thrown our way during the past four years, we have come a long way. It is unfortunate and hugely dispiriting to see a segment of our media constantly churning out lies and half-truths and spreading speculations and misstatements. The standard line of argument employed by this section of media is that the Sharif brothers do not set up development projects unless they have lucrative prospects to line their pockets with commission and kickbacks. Together with some vested interests, they never tire of trumpeting the mantra that their development projects are an example of corruption and financial irregularities. This is done with complete impunity and without presenting proof.Can the media name as many projects in the last 70 years like those started and completed by the PML-N government within the short span of four years? The gas-fuelled power projects of 3,600 MW, whose first phase is already in operation, will be completely inducted into the system by the end of this year. This is in addition to the power projects included in the CPEC basket, such as the Sahiwal Coal Power Plant, Port Qasim Power Plant and Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park.How could this segment of the media forget the massive loss worth billions inflicted on the nation by the rental power projects? How could they turn a blind eye to how the machinery of the Nandipur Power Project rusted at the Karachi port while the file of the project lay in the drawer of a former PPP minister? How was the nation led up the garden path in the case of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam project? It is only now that the acquisition of land has been completed with Rs100 billion by the PML-N government.The point I am making is that attempts to disfigure, twist and cherry-pick facts do no service to the nation. They will only darken our path. The media should have the courage to state facts as they are. I have no problem if your criticisms are justified. But what journalistic ethics also demands is that you should also tell the other side of the story. In the case of development projects completed by Punjab, the headlines of transparency and savings are too powerful to be ignored.A heavy responsibility rests on our shoulders. First and foremost, we are Pakistanis and our other associations come later. I am not here to criticise my opponents. Instead, I’m here to drive home the point that each one of us, in our individual and collective capacity, has a responsibility to educate and sensitise our nation about the challenges that stare us in the face: the challenges of terrorism, political instability and corruption.Our people, who have been fed on a diet of speculations, also deserve to be told that the projects directly linked to their economic survival – whose ground-breaking was performed only a couple of years ago – have been completed. The broad message is that everything is possible if we are honest in our intentions and committed to our goals. We will only make a respectable nation when we believe in our ability to work wonders and are respected by our friends and foes alike.In the case of power projects, the Guddu Power Plant, which was constructed a few years ago, is an apt reference point. It was constructed at a cost of $836,000 per kilowatt. Compared to this, three RLNG-fuelled projects have been built at the cost of $470,000 per kilowatt. The Punjab Power Plant will incur Rs10 billion less as compared to three gas power projects. Likewise, the first phase of these projects came online in 17.5 months on an average but the first phase of the Punjab Power Plant will become operational in 14 months.This is the story that a seeing eye has not seen and a hearing ear has not heard. The project will use the machinery of the highest quality to be supplied by renowned global firms such as Siemens and will be instrumental in producing cheap electricity that will directly benefit the consumers.Punjab’s experience of setting up power projects at tariffs that are far below Nepra’s capping is a lesson in how we fight for each penny in an effort to save as much as we can to benefit the common man. Let us tell the outside world that Pakistanis are hard-working and honest people who have what it takes to work wonders and achieve excellence."
831,"Oil prices dipped on Thursday after the United States reported record crude exports, although traders said that efforts led by OPEC and Russia to cut production meant markets remained well supported overall.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures CLc1 were trading at $49.90 per barrel at 0015 GMT, down 8 cents, or 0.16 percent, from their last close.Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were down 5 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $55.75 a barrel.The declines came after the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said late on Wednesday that US crude oil exports jumped to 1.98 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, surpassing the 1.5 million bpd record set the previous week.The increase has been triggered by the wide spread between US WTI and international Brent crude prices, which makes US oil exports attractive.Some traders said this was also an indicator that markets remained amply supplied despite efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to cut output to tighten the market and prop up prices.Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank said it was “still too early” for oil markets to expect crude prices to see a sustained period above $60 per barrel.commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank said it was “still too early” for oil markets to expect crude prices to see a sustained period above $60 per barrel.But analysts said that oil prices were unlikely to fall much further.“Oil prices remain supported by ongoing supply restrictions from the OPEC and Russia, with the agreement likely to be extended ... Any weakness in oil prices are thus likely to be short-lived,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday during an industry event in Moscow that the pledge between OPEC and other producers including Russia to cut oil output could be extended to the end of 2018, instead of expiring in March 2018.The pact between OPEC and other producers, which excludes the United States, on cutting output by about 1.8 million bpd took effect in January this year."
832,"WASHINGTON: General Motors Co’s self-driving unit, Cruise Automation, has more than doubled the size of its test fleet of robot cars in California during the past three months, a GM spokesman said on Wednesday.As the company increases the size of its test fleet, it has also reported more run-ins between its self-driving cars and human-operated vehicles and bicycles, telling California regulators its vehicles were involved in six minor crashes in the state in September.“All our incidents this year were caused by the other vehicle,” said Rebecca Mark, spokeswoman for GM Cruise.In the past three months, the Cruise unit has increased the number of vehicles registered for testing on California streets to 100 from the previous 30 to 40, GM spokesman Ray Wert said.Cruise is testing vehicles in San Francisco as part of its effort to develop software capable of navigating congested and often chaotic urban environments.Investors are watching GM’s progress closely, and the automaker’s shares have risen 17 percent during the past month as some analysts have said the company could deploy robot taxis within the next year or two.A U.S. Senate panel approved legislation on Wednesday that would allow automakers to greatly expand testing of self-driving cars. Some safety groups have objected to the proposal, saying it gives too much latitude to automakers.As Cruise, and rivals, put more self-driving vehicles on the road to gather data to train their artificial intelligence systems, they are more frequently encountering human drivers who are not programmed to obey all traffic laws.In filings to California regulators, Cruise said the six accidents in the state last month involved other cars and a bicyclist hitting its test cars.The accidents did not result in injuries or serious damage, according to the GM reports. In total, GM Cruise vehicles have been involved in 13 collisions reported to California regulators in 2017, while Alphabet Inc’s Waymo vehicles have been involved in three crashes.California state law requires that all crashes involving self-driving vehicles be reported, regardless of severity.Most of the crashes involved drivers of other vehicles striking the GM cars that were slowing for stop signs, pedestrians or other issues. In one crash, a driver of a Ford Ranger was on his cellphone when he rear-ended a Chevrolet Bolt stopped at a red light.In another instance, the driver of a Chevrolet Bolt noticed an intoxicated cyclist in San Francisco going the wrong direction toward the Bolt. The human driver stopped the Bolt and the cyclist hit the bumper and fell over. The bicyclist pulled on a sensor attached to the vehicle causing minor damage.”While we look forward to the day when autonomous vehicles are commonplace, the streets we drive on today are not so simple, and we will continue to learn how humans drive and improve how we share the road together,” GM said in a statement on Wednesday."
833,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google’s announcement that it was planning to launch a smart video camera as part of its push into hardware sent shares of action camera maker GoPro Inc down more than six percent on Wednesday.Google Clips will be the first standalone camera from the search and advertising company, which has expanded its hardware business over the last year.Its signature feature draws on machine learning technology to automatically begin recording when notable actions are detected. Those could include a child cracking a smile or a dog entering the frame.It was one of a suite of new products unveiled by Alphabet Inc’s Google on Wednesday. Its move into smartphones, speakers and laptops has put the search giant into competition with Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc.Clips, which Google said is “coming soon,” takes on compact cameras such as GoPro’s Hero5 Session and Snap Inc’s Spectacles as each strives to make the process of recording video simpler and more mobile.GoPro stock closed down 6.3 percent at $10.39. Shares of Snap, which derives revenue mostly from ad sales on its social media app, dropped 0.75 percent to $14.53.Google’s camera has a traditional shutter button. But users may also clip the camera onto an object and have Clips automatically record “stable, clear shots” of familiar faces set by the user, the company said. Each shot lasts seven seconds, and the battery survives about three hours in the smart-capture mode, according to Google.“We hope Google Clips helps you capture more spontaneous moments in life, without any of the hassle,” Google Clips product manager Juston Payne wrote in a company blog post.Footage wirelessly downloads through an app for Google, Apple and Samsung smartphones. Video can be stored to an unlimited online storage locker provided by Google, and high-resolution photos can be cut from the clip.At $249, it is comparable to GoPro’s $299 Hero5 Session, which can be controlled by voice for handsfree usage. Snap’s Spectacles, which are sunglasses with a video camera on one corner, records a 10-second video after the press of a button on the frame. They cost $129.Session and Spectacles are typically used outdoors, whereas Google said its devices “works best when used at home with family and close friends.” GoPro and Snap have not released smart-capture capability."
834,"CHICAGO: A DNA-based Zika vaccine from Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc and South Korea’s GeneOne Life Science Inc induced anti-Zika immune responses in an early stage human trial, US researchers reported on Wednesday.Unlike conventional vaccines, which often use inactivated or killed versions of a virus, the Inovio-GeneOne shot is a synthetic vaccine made by reproducing sections of the Zika virus genome in a lab, and then loading them onto a ring of genetic material called a plasmid.This vaccine is then injected beneath the skin and followed up with a device that generates electrical impulses, creating small pores in cells that allow the DNA to pass into cells.After three doses of the Zika vaccine known as GLS-5700, all 40 healthy volunteers in the study developed Zika-specific antibodies.“Everybody made antibodies,” said Dr. Pablo Tebas, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania who led the study.To see if these antibodies could be protective against the virus, blood from immunized study participants was injected into mice who were then exposed to Zika. Animals that had received the Zika-specific antibodies were protected.“When we gave mice serum from the same people before they got the vaccine, they were not protected. The mice died,” Tebas said in a telephone interview.Tebas said the study shows how nimble synthetic DNA vaccines can be, noting that it took just seven months from the time the vaccine was first designed until the start of the clinical trial. “This technique of making DNA vaccines is very fast,” he said.More testing will be needed to show the vaccine is effective at protecting people from Zika, and that could prove challenging given that the once-explosive epidemic has slowed and there are few large populations now at risk for Zika infection.Zika caused thousands of cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly in Brazil in 2015, prompting the World Health Organization to declare Zika a public health emergency in February 2016.Last November, the WHO dropped the emergency designation but stressed that the virus, found in at least 60 countries, will keep spreading where mosquitoes that carry the virus are present.Last month, Sanofi SA ended development efforts on its Zika vaccine, based on an inactivated or killed Zika virus. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co is still working on a Zika vaccine using this approach."
835,"DUBAI: Saudi authorities said on Wednesday they had arrested 22 people, including a Qatari national, for using social media to spread dissent.Another 24 people were detained in the northern Hail region for stirring tribal divisions, the state news agency SPA reported.Neither report went into the details of the offences.The announcements came days after an order from King Salman lifting a ban on women driving in the conservative Islamic kingdom.Saudi Arabia, alongside the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt, has also cut diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar accusing it of supporting militants and Iran — charges Doha denies.Citing a source in the newly-created Presidency of State Security, the counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence body, SPA said the 22 had been detained after authorities spotted videos on social media “inciting against public order”.The online postings stirred “up feelings towards issues that are still under consideration,” and incited people to commit crimes, SPA said.Separately, SPA carried a statement from the interior ministry saying that during unspecified investigations in Hail, “people linked to the case were promoting lies and exaggerations about their circumstances in order to provoke sedition and tribal tensions”.Soon after the two reports, Saudi Arabia’s top clerical body, the General Secretariat of the Council of Senior Religious Scholars, issued a statement saying, “Anyone who tried to harm the kingdom security and the unity of its people has committed a dangerous crime”."
836,"SAN FRANCISCO: Alphabet Inc’s Google on Wednesday unveiled the second generation of its Pixel smartphone along with new voice-enabled home speakers, redoubling its commitment to the hardware business as it competes with a surge of devices from Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc.Google’s new products, including a Pixelbook laptop, wireless earbuds and a small GoPro-like camera, showcase Google-developed operating systems and services, notably the voice assistant. That means usage of those devices should stoke the company’s core ad sales business as buyers of the hardware use Google services like search and maps.Speaking at the launch in San Francisco, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said the new products “perfectly demonstrate our strategy of re-imagining hardware from the inside out.”The Pixel 2 smartphone comes in two sizes, with comparable features, including aluminium bodies and no traditional jacks for headphones. Prices for the base model start at $649 (490.18 pounds), while the high-end version starts at $849. The phones will be available Oct. 19.The Pixel phones lack the brand lustre and market share of similarly priced smartphones such as the Apple iPhone or Samsung Electronics Co’s Galaxy S and Galaxy Note smartphones. Still, the original Pixel’s camera and software drew acclaim from reviewers, many of whom expect the line to become a robust competitor at the high end of the Android smartphone market.Pixelbook, priced at $999, is the first laptop powered by Google Assistant and will support Snap Inc’s Snapchat, the company said. The keyboard folds behind the screen to turn the 12.3-inch touchscreen into a tablet. It will be available in stores from Oct. 31.Google Home Mini, one of the new speakers, is priced at $49 in the United States and would rival Amazon.com Inc’s popular Echo Dot. It will be available Oct. 19. The Home Max, with dual woofers for more powerful sound, is priced at $399 and with availability by the end of the year.The Pixel Buds, which are priced at $149, arrive in November. Clips, which is pocket-sized camera with object detection and automatic recording capabilities, “soon” goes on sale for $249, Google said. Videos last only a few seconds and do not contain audio.The Pixel smartphone debuted a year ago, with analysts estimating sales of more than 2 million, pushing Google to record amounts of non-advertising revenue.Google’s “other” revenue category, which includes both hardware and sales of online storage services, accounted for about 12 percent of overall sales in its most recent quarter.Last month, Google expanded its hardware development capabilities by picking up a 2,000-person smartphone engineering team at HTC for $1.1 billion.“It’s pretty clear Google is serious about hardware,” said Avi Greengart, research director at consumer data firm GlobalData. “Given that there is a Pixel 2, and given the financial investment, there must be a longer-term strategic intent.”Google moved into smartphones five years ago with the $12.5-billion purchase of Motorola Mobility. But Motorola’s hardware team, under Osterloh, and Google’s Android mobile operating system division remained independent. Google wanted to avoid giving it a special advantage and protect its relationships with Samsung, LG and other distributors of Android. The company later sold the Motorola smartphone business.Osterloh, now working inside Google, moved to bring in-house the HTC team Google contracted to design the Pixel. He enjoys a strong relationship with Hiroshi Lockheimer, the Android division head. The pair have been friends since working together for several years at Good Technology in the early 2000s.Protecting relationships with others in the Android ecosystem has become less of a concern. Samsung ratched down the rivalary with Google after the firms agreed to a major patent licensing deal in early 2014. Other vendors have seen their market share dip.Google’s eye is now on Apple, whose iPhone has become the smartphone to beat.The first Pixel debuted a year ago with a significant marketing push: during the last three months of the year, Google spent an estimated $110 million to air 12 Pixel-related commercials, according to data from advertising measurement firm iSpot.tv.Apple spent $147 million during the same span, iSpot.tv said. Apple has sustained its TV time throughout the last year, while Google’s efforts have tapered off.In the speakers market, Google’s personal-assistant lags Amazon’s Echo devices in market share, according to investment bank Cowen & Co. Last week, Amazon released several new models of the Echo, including one with a display as it tried to find a place in every niche.Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Google’s Home hardware unit, said in an interview that Google was being “a little bit more thoughtful” than the online shopping company.“Amazon is taking a broad approach,” Chandra said. “We’re going to iterate until we have a good product story to tell.”"
837,"LAS VEGAS: The girlfriend of the Las Vegas gunman who killed 58 people and himself in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history was questioned by the FBI on Wednesday and said she had no idea he was “planning violence against anyone.”Marilou Danley, who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines and is regarded by investigators as a “person of interest,” said through a lawyer that the carnage Stephen Paddock unleashed while she was abroad caught her completely unaware.“He never said anything to me or took any action that I was aware of that I understood in any way to be a warning that something horrible like this was going to happen,” Danley, 62, said in a written statement read to reporters by her attorney in Los Angeles, where the FBI was questioning her.A Federal Bureau of Investigation official in Las Vegas, meanwhile, said no one has been taken into custody.But Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters he found it hard to believe that the arsenal of weapons, ammunition and explosives recovered by police in their investigation could have been assembled by Paddock completely on his own.“You have to make an assumption that he had some help at some point,” Lombardo said at a news briefing. Lombardo said the attack was the obvious outcome of meticulous planning.“What we know is that Stephen Paddock is a man who spent decades acquiring weapons and ammo and living a secret life, much of which will never be fully understood,” the sheriff said.Nearly 500 people were also injured when Paddock, 64, strafed an outdoor concert with gunfire on Sunday night from his 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip.He took his own life before police stormed his room, bringing the total death toll to 59.Police recovered nearly 50 firearms from three locations they searched, nearly half of them from the hotel suite. Twelve of the rifles there were fitted with so-called bump stocks, officials said, allowing the guns to be fired almost as though they were automatic weapons.In response to a question, Lombardo said investigators were examining the possibility Paddock’s purchase of more than 30 guns in October 2016 may have been precipitated by some triggering event in his life. He did not elaborate.If Paddock did have any accomplice, there remained no evidence as yet “to indicate terrorism” in the shooting spree, said Aaron Rouse, FBI special agent in charge of the Las Vegas field office.Earlier in the day, US President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas, marking the first time since taking office that he has had to confront a major mass shooting.In her statement after being questioned in Los Angeles, Paddock’s girlfriend Danley insisted she knew Paddock as “a kind, caring, quiet man.”“It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.” Her lawyer, Matt Lombard, said Danley was “fully cooperating” with the investigation.Danley, an Australian citizen of Filipino heritage, said she flew back to the United States voluntarily “because I know that the FBI and Las Vegas Police Department wanted to talk to me, and I wanted to talk to them.”Danley, who was twice married before her relationship with Paddock, became a focus of the investigation for having shared his retirement community condo in Mesquite, Nevada, northeast of Las Vegas, before leaving the United States for the Philippines in mid-September.FBI agents met her plane at Los Angeles International Airport before interviewing her, two US officials briefed on the case told Reuters. As of midday Wednesday, there was no indication she was aware of Paddock’s plans, they said.Investigators questioned her about Paddock’s weapons purchases, a $100,000 wire transfer to a Philippine bank that appeared to be intended for her, and whether she saw any changes in his behavior before she left the United States.“Assuming she had no role in his actions, the most important thing is any light she can shed on Paddock’s motive,” said one official, who spoke about the investigation on condition of anonymity.Danley said Paddock had bought her an airline ticket to visit her family and wired her money to purchase property there, leading her to worry he might be planning to break up with her.Paddock’s brother Eric told reporters the $100,000 transfer was evidence that “Steve took care of the people he loved,” and that he likely wanted to protect Danley by sending her overseas before the attack.She arrived in Manila on Sept. 15, flew to Hong Kong on Sept. 22, returned to Manila on Sept. 25 and was there until she flew to Los Angeles on Tuesday night, according to a Philippine immigration official.Discerning Paddock’s motive has proven especially baffling given the absence of the indicators typical in other mass shootings. He had no criminal record, no known history of mental illness and no outward signs of social disaffection, political discontent or extremist ideology, police said.Trump, touring a hospital in Las Vegas, told reporters Paddock was “very demented,” and he asked Lombardo if investigators were any closer to establishing a motive.“We’ve had a couple good leads and we’re working our way through it,” Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told the president."
838,"WASHINGTON: The special counsel investigating whether Russia tried to sway the 2016 US election has taken over FBI inquiries into a former British spy’s dossier of allegations of Russian financial and personal links to President Donald Trump’s campaign and associates, sources familiar with the inquiry told Reuters.A report compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele identified Russian businessmen and others whom US intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government.A spokesman for special counsel Robert Mueller declined to comment. The FBI also declined comment.Three sources with knowledge of Mueller’s probe said his investigators have assumed control of multiple inquiries into allegations by US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump, a Republican.Russia has repeatedly denied any meddling in the election.Two officials familiar with the investigations said that both Mueller’s team and the Senate Intelligence Committee are seeking any evidence that former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort or others who had financial dealings with Russia might have helped Kremlin intelligence agencies target email hacking and social media postings undermining Trump’s election opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton.On Wednesday, the Senate panel’s chairman Richard Burr told reporters that the issue of whether Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question.“We have not come to any determination on collusion,” Burr said.Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in January.Trump was told by former FBI director James Comey that Steele’s report contained salacious material about the businessman-turned-president.Burr said on Wednesday that the Senate panel had made several attempts to contact Steele and to meet him and “those offers have gone unaccepted.”“The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources,” Burr said.Burr said the panel wanted to finish its investigation by the end of the year.Although several news organizations, including Reuters, were briefed on Steele’s dossier before the election in November, most decided not to report on the material because its inflammatory and sometimes salacious content could not be verified.In a report published in January, four US intelligence agencies said they took the dossier’s allegations seriously.Separately, three Russian businessmen, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan have sued Washington investigations firm Fusion GPS and its founder, Glenn Simpson, with allegations that they were libelled in Steele’s dossier.A spokeswoman for Simpson and Fusion GPS declined to comment on the lawsuit filed on Tuesday in US District Court in Washington.The lawsuit said that Steele’s reports were “gravely damaging” to the businessmen because they accused them “of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with the ‘Kremlin’ to influence the 2016 presidential election.”The information on Trump collected by Steele, whom officials say was one of MI6’s most respected Russia hands, was laid out last year in political “opposition research” initially financed by supporters of one of Trump’s Republican primary election opponents.After Trump won the Republican nomination in July, backers of Clinton picked up the support of Steele’s work.The lawsuit said the dossier’s allegations are false in implying an improper “ongoing” relationship between the businessmen, the Alfa Group financial company in which they were investors and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that a Russian government official acted as a middleman in such contacts."
839,"ATHENS: Greece welcomed a decision by senior archaeologists to conditionally permit a major tourism project in Athens on Wednesday, saying it cleared the way for the country to turn the site into one of Europe’s biggest coastal resorts.The 8-billion-euro ($9.4-billion) project to develop the disused Hellenikon airport site is a key term of Greece’s international bailout and is closely watched by its official creditors and potential investors in the crisis-hit country.Greek developer Lamda signed a 99-year lease with the state in 2014 for the 620-hectare (1,530-acre) area, once the site of Athens airport. But the project has faced delays, partly over a long-running row between developers and those who fear it will damage the environment and cultural heritage.After three inconclusive meetings in recent weeks, the Central Archaeological Council, an advisory body, recommended on Tuesday that about 30 hectares (74 acres) of the 620-hectare plot under the project be declared an archaeological site.“The decision is fine,” Deputy Economy Minister in charge of investments, Stergios Pitsiorlas, told Reuters. “The fact that a small area is declared of archaeological interest shields the whole process from future litigation.”Pitsiorlas said the recommendation meant that archaeologists will have a closer supervision of construction work.Backed by Chinese and Gulf funds, Lamda submitted its detailed development plan for Hellenikon in July, setting off a licensing process which will wrap up with a decree.The Council approved the plan on Tuesday and designated specific areas where construction should not be allowed. It was not immediately clear how the Council’s recommendation could affect Lamda’s construction plan.Lamda said it was waiting to be officially notified over the decision before making any public statement, noting that “the importance of the archaeological findings has been included from the beginning in the company’s undertakings”.It said it should be able to assess the impact of the Council’s decision on its development plan once it has reviewed the resolutions and accompanying diagrams.The recommendation is not binding, however, the culture ministry always respects the body’s decisions.Greece on Monday overcame another hurdle to the project by winning an appeal over objections by forestry officials.Hellenikon has become a major political issue in Greece, which is slowly emerging from a multi-year debt crisis.Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose leftist party strongly opposed it before coming to power in 2015, is now seen as keen to implement the deal to help boost economic activity and reduce unemployment, the euro zone’s highest.Referring to the council’s decision, Deputy Foreign Minister Giannis Amanatidis said it was “a complicated process which was resolved in the best possible way”."
840,"PHOENIX: A federal judge on Wednesday upheld President Donald Trump’s pardon earlier this year of 85-year-old former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, rejecting legal challenges by outside groups.US District Judge Susan Bolton said that she had considered the petitions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and other organizations, including one staffed by lawyers who worked for former Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, but found no legal grounds to overturn the pardon.Bolton did not rule on a request by Arpaio’s attorneys to take the further step of vacating his conviction.Trump, a Republican who has promised to build a wall along the US border with Mexico, has praised Arpaio’s crackdown on illegal immigrants in Maricopa County, Arizona, that drew condemnation from civil rights groups.Arpaio was convicted in July of willfully violating a 2011 injunction barring his officers from stopping and detaining Latino motorists solely on suspicion they were in the country illegally. He had not yet been sentenced when Trump issued the pardon in August."
841,"DUBAI: Sri Lanka will hope their left-arm spinner Rangana Herath maintains pressure on Pakistan when the second and final Test -- a day-night affair with pink ball -- starts at Dubai stadium on Friday.The 39-year-old took 6-43 on the final day to fail Pakistan´s modest 136-run chase in the first Test in Abu Dhabi on Monday.The narrow 21-run win gives Sri Lanka a unique chance for a series win over Pakistan on their neutral venues of United Arab Emirates where they have never lost a series in nine attempts.They have won five and drawn four series in the UAE ever since the 2009 terrorist attacks on the Sri Lankan team bus forced them to play home matches out of Pakistan.Herath exposed the new batting line up of Pakistan, playing without their batting greats Younis Khan and Misbah-ul-Haq for the time since they retired in May this year.Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal described Herath as ""a team man and an asset."" ""I have no idea how long he is going to play, but I am sure he will do what he can for the team,"" said Chandimal of Herath who completed 400 wickets in his 84th Tests in Abu Dhabi. ""He is a team man and an asset.""The left-arm spinner also reached 100 wickets against Pakistan during the first Test. ""We need to be at our best again and can´t underestimate Pakistan because we know they are a good team,"" said Chandimal whose team will rise one spot to replace Pakistan on sixth, even with a 1-0 result. Chandimal anchored the batting with a polished 155 not out in Sri Lanka´s first innings total of 419, ably filling in for the more experienced Angelo Mathews who didn´t come with the squad due to a calf injury.Sarfraz Ahmed hopes Pakistan team moves on from the defeat in his first Test as captain. ""We will do our best to be more positive against Herath,"" said Sarfraz. ""We have never lost in UAE so it´s also important to keep that record intact.""Pakistan will be assess pacer Hasan Ali in the next two days after he had fitness issues while they also hope spearhead Mohammad Amir returns to form with the pink ball after going wicketless in the first Test.Debutant Haris Sohail provided a positive in the batting after scores of 76 and 34 while Azhar Ali scored 85.The match will be the sixth day-night Test after the innovation was first adopted by Australia when they took on New Zealand at Adelaide in 2015.Pakistan beat the West Indies in their first day-night Test at the same venue last year but this will be the first time Sri Lanka feature in a pink ball Test.

842,"WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday he had never considered resigning and was committed to President Donald Trump’s agenda, but failed to address whether he had referred to the president as a “moron,” as NBC reported.The State Department later denied he had even used the word, an issue Tillerson earlier declined to specifically address.“The Secretary .... does not use that language to speak about anyone. He did not say that,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a briefing.The top US diplomat, whose tenure has been dogged with rumours about unhappiness with Trump’s policies and rhetoric, said he was as committed to Trump’s agenda today as he was when he accepted the offer to serve as secretary of state.The episode is the latest controversy to embroil Trump’s administration which has witnessed a string of high-profile departures and firings in recent months, including his chief of staff, national security advisor and the former FBI director.NBC reported that in a session with Trump’s national security team and Cabinet officials at the Pentagon, Tillerson had openly criticized the president and referred to him as a “moron,” citing three officials familiar with the incident.Tillerson sidestepped the issue when taking questions after making a statement at a hastily organised news conference.“I‘m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,” he said, adding, “I‘m not from this place (Washington), but the places I come from we don’t deal with that kind of petty nonsense.”Tillerson spoke after NBC reported that Vice President Mike Pence and other top officials had intervened to persuade him not to resign this summer as tensions rose between him and Trump.“The vice president has never had to persuade me to remain as secretary of state because I have never considered leaving this post,” Tillerson said.“My commitment to the success of our president and our country is as strong as it was the day I accepted his offer to serve as secretary of state,” Tillerson said.Nauert said Tillerson and Trump had spoken later on Wednesday and that it was a “good conversation”. Tillerson did not offer an apology to Trump because “one was not needed”.Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon and former president of the Boy Scouts, said of Trump: “He’s smart. He demands results.”Trump later told reporters in Las Vegas: “I‘m very honoured by his comments. It was fake news, it was a totally phony story. ... It was made up by NBC. They just made it up. ... Total confidence in Rex. I have total confidence.”Trump had appeared to undercut Tillerson over the weekend when the president tweeted that he told him that he was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.Tillerson offered a vigorous defence of both the US president and his foreign policy even though the White House and State Department have at times appeared to differ on policy.“President Trump’s foreign policy goals break the mold of what people traditionally think is achievable on behalf of our country,” Tillerson said.The embarrassing episode underscored the sense of disarray that US friends and foes alike have detected in their dealings with Trump’s foreign policy apparatus and could further undermine US credibility in world affairs.Pence, in a statement, said he never discussed with Tillerson the prospect of the secretary of state’s resignation.In a tweet, Trump earlier urged NBC to apologise for its story, but NBC News anchor Hallie Jackson said on air: “NBC will not be issuing an apology to America as the president is calling for because again ... the secretary did not refute directly some of the key points” in the story.Several NBC journalists who reported the story also stood by their piece, saying on MSNBC that their reporting was true.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has played down any tensions between Trump and Tillerson over their apparent split, most recently over North Korea.Some administration officials have privately described Tillerson as chafing against some of the president’s pronouncements and off-the-cuff decisions, sometimes contrary to advice from senior advisers.One US official said the view of many within the administration was that despite Tillerson’s denial of having contemplated resignation, “it’s only a matter of time” before he does consider it.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no reason to believe that Trump would give up his habit of publicly contradicting Tillerson and that each time speculation on his future would resurface.Tillerson has often found himself at odds with the president on a range of issues, according to current and former US officials and media reports.He has taken a more hawkish view on Russia and tried to mediate a dispute among key US Mideast allies after four Arab nations boycotted Qatar over its alleged extremist ties.Tillerson also appeared to distance himself from Trump’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Virginia this summer, saying at the time “the president speaks for himself” when asked about Trump’s values.Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, said Tillerson was working under difficult circumstances because some in the administration are undermining his authority by trying to act as secretary of state on a daily basis. He declined to name names.Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, was asked whether he supported Tillerson, and said:“As a team, Tillerson, Mattis and (White House Chief of Staff John) Kelly help separate us from chaos, so I absolutely support ‘em. Absolutely.”Tillerson was confirmed by only 56-43 at his Senate confirmation hearing in January, an unusually low confirmation for a secretary of state.Many members of Congress, including Republicans, strongly object to his plans to slash the State Department and foreign aid budgets."
843,"SAN FRANCISCO: Google on Wednesday unveiled new versions of its Pixel smartphone, the highlight of a refreshed line aimed at weaving artificial intelligence deeper into modern lives.Google software and artificial intelligence were common threads in the gamut of new devices it unveiled to step up its challenge on the hardware front to rivals such as Apple and AmazonThe new Pixel 2 and larger Pixel 2 XL are the first Google-made phones to be released since the California tech giant announced the acquisition of key segments of Taiwan-based electronics group HTC.The upgraded smartphones will be available for order as of Wednesday in six countries starting at $649 for five-inch display Pixel 2, and $849 for the six-inch Pixel 2 XL.The new aluminium-body smartphones along with Google's upgraded connected speakers and new laptop computer all aim to infuse artificial intelligence to make the devices more user-friendly, built around the Google Assistant — the rival to Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft's Cortana and others.Google vice president Rick Osterloh said Google's new devices ""are simple to use and they anticipate your needs.""Osterloh told the product launch event in San Francisco: ""You interact with your devices naturally with your voice or by touching them.""Google, by bringing in a team of engineers from HTC, aims to emulate the success of Apple iPhones by controlling the hardware as well as the software used in the premium-priced handsets.The revamped camera in the smartphone retains a single lens but seeks to improve images via ""computational photography,"" an artificial intelligence tool that can enhance pictures.Analyst Ian Fogg of IHS Markit said in a tweet that the new smartphone ""adds incremental improvements on the great v1"" while noting that ""Google's challenge is to solve production limits which hurt the original.""Fogg said the use of computation to improve images with a single lens ""is technically impressive.""Google announced a slimmed down version of its connected speaker called Google Home Mini starting at $49 in the United States, stepping up its challenge to market leader Amazon.The new Google Home Mini is available for pre-order in the seven countries where the device is offered and will go on sale in stores October 19, the company said.The new speaker, which responds to voice commands using artificial intelligence, is less than half the price of Google's first generation speaker and makes this ""more accessible to more people,"" said Google hardware designer Isabelle Olsson.A premium version of the speaker — a $399 Google Home Max unveiled Wednesday — offers more power and audio quality for music aficionados.The new Google Clips camera — one of the surprises of the event — ""looks for smiles (and) moments, because the software is in the camera,"" said Google product manager Juston Payne.""It's like having my own photographer shooting and choosing my best moments for me,"" Payne said of the $249 device.Another surprise from the event was the wireless Pixel Buds, which can deliver audio from a smartphone and also include the Google Assistant and real-time translation.A demonstration at the event included a two-way conversation with one person speaking English and the other Swedish.""The camera and the earbuds were really held up as examples of what the company can do by leveraging the Google Assistant,"" said Ross Rubin of Reticle Research.A new Pixelbook laptop was touted as a ""high performance"" computer powered by its Chrome operating system and designed as a rival to Microsoft's Surface and Apple's iPad Pro.With a 12.3-inch display, the device is a convertible PC that can be used as a tablet and is sold starting at $999 for US customers.Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said the new devices showcase the tech giant's artificial intelligence.""We've been working hard continuing our shift from a mobile-first to an AI-first world,"" he said.""We are working on software and hardware together because that is the best way to drive computing forward.""The launch comes in the wake of Apple's announcement of a new line of iPhones, and Amazon's upgrades to its Echo speakers powered by its Alexa digital assistant""It is a portfolio designed to take Google into more parts of your life, particularly in your home,"" Reticle Research analyst Ross Rubin said of the array of devices the internet giant unveiled on Wednesday.""Amazon is focusing on a range of price points and designs; Google is focusing on a range of experiences.""COVER IMAGE: The new Google Pixel 2 XL smartphone is seen (front-side) at a product launch event at the SFJAZZ Center, October 4, 2017.

844,"WASHINGTON: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un is a rational politician and the US needs to understand that to deal with the nuclear-armed country, a top Central Intelligence Agency Korea expert said Wednesday.""Beyond the bluster, Kim Jong-Un is a rational actor,"" said Yong Suk Lee, the deputy assistant director of the CIA´s Korea Mission Center. ""We have a tendency in this country to underestimate his conservatism."" ""He wants to rule for a long time and die in his own bed,"" Lee said at a conference on the CIA at George Washington University. US politicians including President Donald Trump have repeatedly painted Pyongyang´s strongman as irrational and ""crazy.""But Lee said Kim´s focus is to stay in power, as shown by the brutal murder in Malaysia in February of his half brother Kim Jong-Nam, which has been blamed on Pyongyang agents.""All politics is local,"" he said of the North Korean milieu.The country´s long history of being surrounded by greater powers, too, means that the country is constantly on the defensive, and its leaders play that up. ""North Korea is a political organism that thrives on confrontation,"" Lee said.But Kim´s fierce defense of his position and his combativeness against Washington does not mean he will act irrationally now that he has the capacity to fire a nuclear tipped missile at the United States.""Waking up and deciding to nuke Los Angeles is not in his interest to survive,"" he said."
845,"A bipartisan group of US lawmakers unveiled legislation on Wednesday that would overhaul aspects of the National Security Agency’s warrantless internet surveillance program in an effort to install additional privacy protections.The bill, which will be formally introduced as soon as Thursday, is likely to revive the debate in Washington over the balance between security and privacy, amid concerns among some lawmakers in both parties that the US government may be too eager to spy on its own citizens.The legislation, written by the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, is seen by civil liberties groups as the best chance in Congress to reform the law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, before its expiration on December 31.Senior US intelligence officials consider Section 702 to be among the most vital tools they have to thwart threats to national security and American allies.It allows US intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on and store vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States.But the program, classified details of which were exposed in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also incidentally scoops up communications of Americans, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas. Those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.A discussion draft of the legislation, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, partially restricts the FBI’s ability to access American data collected under Section 702 by requiring the agency to obtain a warrant when seeking evidence of a crime.That limit would not apply, however, to requests of data that involve counterterrorism or counter-espionage.The narrower restriction on what some have called a “backdoor search loophole” has disappointed some civil liberties groups. Several organizations sent a letter this week saying they would not support legislation that did not require a warrant for all queries of American data collected under Section 702.The legislation would also renew the program for six years and codify the National Security Agency’s decision earlier this year to halt the collection of communications that merely mentioned a foreign intelligence target. But that codification would end in six years as well, meaning NSA could potentially resume the activity in 2023.The spy agency has said it lost some operational capability by ending so-called “about” collection due to privacy compliance issues and has lobbied against a law that would make its termination permanent.Republican senators introduced a bill earlier this year to renew Section 702 without changes and make it permanent, a position backed by the White House and intelligence agencies.But that effort is expected to face major resistance in the House, where an influential conservative bloc of Republicans earlier this year said it opposed renewal unless major changes were made, reflecting disagreement within the majority party.Separately, Senators John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein are working on Section 702 legislation that may also be introduced this week and include fewer reforms.Democratic Senator Ron Wyden and Republican Senator Rand Paul are also planning to introduce a bill that would require a warrant for any query of Section 702 involving data belonging to an American."

849,"KARACHI: Five more girls were wounded in fresh knife attacks in Karachi late Wednesday, police said, which occurred over a span of three hours.The latest attack took place at Gulshan Chowrangi, in which a 12-year-old girl was assaulted with a knife.Late on Wednesday, the attacker first targeted a woman in the city's Gulshan-e-Jamal area, followed by another attack near Dalmia road, the police said.Within an hour of the two attacks, another woman — a student of Federal Urdu University of Arts Science and Technology — was attacked in the metropolis' NIPA Chowrangi vicinity.Over the next couple of hours, the assailant stabbed a 13-year-old girl In Gulshan-e-Iqbal area.

850,"MOSCOW: Saudi Arabia´s King Salman arrived in Moscow on Wednesday, the first official visit to Russia by a ruler of the Sunni state.His three-day trip is expected to focus on energy and the Syrian conflict.Salman could be seen descending an escalator from his plane in Moscow´s Vnukovo airport after landing around 1600GMT.The escalator, however, stopped midway, forcing the king to wait. He eventually walked down onto damp tarmac where he was met by Russian officials and a military brass band.Saudi Arabia and Russia are heavily dependent on oil exports and the plunge of the price of crude that began in 2014 lashed both of their economies.Salman will meet President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and they are expected to discuss extending oil production cuts ahead of the OPEC oil cartel meeting in November.OPEC and some other non-member producers, including Russia, have agreed to cut crude output which has helped prop up oil prices. On Wednesday Putin said an extension of the OPEC deal was possible and could last ""at least to the end of 2018"".OPEC and its allies agreed from the beginning of 2017 to cut their production by around 1.8 million barrels per day for six months. It was subsequently extended through March 2018.Riyadh has had to slash subsidies and delay major projects since the mid-2014 price on crude, and Salman is keen to continue efforts to control output to bolster prices.The king is also set to met Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday before leaving Russia on Saturday.Russian energy minister Alexander Novak told TASS news agency on Wednesday that Saudi Arabia is investing $1 billion into energy projects in Russia though he did not give details or specify if these deals would be signed during the visit.Vedomosti newspaper reported Wednesday that Saudi Arabia´s sovereign fund is also eyeing investment into a toll road project in Moscow, which would be the first one for the capital.While they are partners on the oil market, on the foreign policy front, Moscow and Riyadh land on opposite sides of the Syrian conflict, with Russia supporting the regime of Bashar al-Assad while Saudi Arabia supports his opposition.The Kremlin said ahead of the visit that Salman and Putin will discuss ""the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, especially focusing conflict situations in the region.""The two also diverge on Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been bombing Huthi rebels since 2015, drawing criticism from Moscow."

So we think there is an opportunity to strengthen that relationship.""Pakistan's relation with the US is ""extraordinarily important"", he said. We told the US that India's role is unacceptable in the new Afghan policy, said Asif.He also said that the allegation of harbouring terrorists in Pakistan was strongly rejected. Asif added that he is hopeful that the two countries will jointly tackle issues and the US and other countries can play a positive role in this regard. He also reiterated Pakistan's stance on the need for an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned political approach to achieving peace and stability in Afghanistan.The foreign minister said the meeting with Tillerson was cordial and the US secretary of state has accepted an invitation to visit Pakistan. Earlier in his address, Tillerson had remarked: ""Our approach to South Asia, specifically Afghanistan, is building relations with India and Pakistan to stamp out terrorism and support the Afghan government in providing security for their home people."" He also remarked that the fate of Daesh is on the ""brink of extinguishing"" due to US President Donald Trump's policy.Tillerson added, ""there is much to be done, we are just getting started."" This was the first high-level meeting after Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi met with the US vice-president in New York, last month.Asif is accompanied by other dignitaries including, Pakistan Ambassador to US Aizaz Chaudhry, additional secretary America MOFA, director general America MOFA and deputy chief of mission Pakistan Embassy. Asif is also expected meet with the US National Security Advisor Lieutenant General HR McMaster and discuss bilateral relations and the situation in Afghanistan and Kashmir, as well as the new policy of US on South Asia. The foreign minister will also address a gathering at the US Institute of Peace (USIP), Washington, on Pakistan-US relations on October 5.The bilateral visits of Pakistani and American diplomats were scheduled during the recent visit of PM Abbasi to the US.Trump, in his speech announcing the revised US approach to Afghan war, had accused Pakistan of providing ""safe haven"" to militants, angering the ruling party and the opposition alike. "
852,"DUBAI: Ace batsman Azhar Ali believes the target Sri Lanka set for Pakistan in the first Test match was achievable, but the top order was, unfortunately, unable to produce a good inning.Despite the fact that two days have gone by after Pakistan lost the Test match to Sri Lanka, the game's disappointing result is still a major topic of discussion, even in the practice sessions.Speaking to media earlier on Thursday, Ali said batting on the fifth day of Test matches has usually been challenging.“This is not the first time; Pakistan has lost on many occasions, chasing a meagre target to bag victory,” he said, adding that the team would come back to the Dubai Test match.Praising the veteran Sri Lankan spinner Rangana Herath, Ali revealed Pakistan had a plan to counter his spinning technique, but the trick didn’t click.Herath — a long-time nemesis of Pakistan — not only completed his 400th Test wicket this time but has, overall, taken 100 wickets in 20 Test matches against the national team.Replying to a question by this correspondent regarding his 5,000-Test-run milestone, Ali commented that it was a moment of pride for him to secure this feat in the seventh year of his career.Ali — the backbone of Pakistan's batting line-up — has become the eighth batsman to complete 5,000 runs in Test matches.“I want to continue to score well and intend to guiding youngsters [the same way] former skippers Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan used to,” he said, before adding with a smile: ""Although, I am not capable of as those two greats were!”"

Rangel said he is here to “counter the message of hate with love and compassion”.

""Right now we are just trying to help each other and the patients kind of get right through this.""

859,"BARCELONA/MADRID: Catalonia will move on Monday to declare independence from Spain after holding a banned referendum, pushing the European Union nation towards a rupture that threatens the foundations of its young democracy.Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said he favoured mediation to find a way out of the crisis but that Spain’s central government had rejected this. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government responded by calling on Catalonia to “return to the path of law” first before any negotiations.Mireia Boya, a Catalan lawmaker from the pro-independence Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, said a declaration of independence would follow a parliamentary session on Monday to evaluate the results of the Oct. 1 vote to break away.“We know that there may be disbarments, arrests ... But we are prepared, and in no case will it be stopped,” she said on Twitter.Puigdemont told the BBC he would ask the region’s parliament to declare independence following the referendum, which Spain’s government and constitutional court say, was illegal and in which only a minority of Catalans voted.In a televised address on Wednesday night, Puigdemont said: “This moment calls for mediation. We have received various offers in the last hours and we will receive more.”Without specifically mentioning plans for an independence declaration, he added: ”I am sure that in the next few days we will show the best of our country when the institutions of Catalonia will have to apply the results of the referendum.“Today we are closer than yesterday to our historic wish.”Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s government replied that Puigdemont had wasted an opportunity to put Catalonia back on a legal course. “If Mr. Puigdemont wants to talk or negotiate, or wants to send mediators, he knows perfectly well what he must do first: Return to the path of the law,” it said in a statement.Participants in the referendum opted overwhelmingly for independence, but turnout was only about 43 percent as Catalans who favour remaining part of Spain mainly boycotted the ballot.Spain was only restored to democracy following the death in 1975 of military dictator Francisco Franco, under whom the Catalan language and traditions were suppressed.The constitutional crisis in Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-biggest economy, has shaken the common currency and hit Spanish stocks and bonds. Madrid’s borrowing costs have risen sharply and reached their highest since March on Wednesday.The cost of insuring against potential losses on Spanish bank debt and Spanish, Italian and Portuguese sovereign debt has also jumped, suggesting an impact on the wider euro zone.Bank stocks were hit especially hard as the Ibex stock index .IBEX fell below 10,000 points on Wednesday for the first time since March 2015. In a sign of the nervous public mood, Catalonia's biggest bank, Caixabank (CABK.MC), and Spain's economy minister had earlier sought to assure bank customers that their deposits were safe.Puigdemont criticised Spain’s King Felipe VI who on Tuesday lambasted the “irresponsible behaviour” of the Catalan leaders.He said the king had disappointed many people in Catalonia by failing to call for dialogue and he accused King Felipe of endorsing the policies of Rajoy, which he said had been “catastrophic” for Catalonia.The EU executive called again on Wednesday for the Spanish government and Catalan authorities to open a dialogue. “It’s time to talk,” the European Commission’s deputy head, Frans Timmermans, told the European Parliament.Various attempts to find a mediated solution to the crisis emerged on Wednesday.Pablo Iglesias, leader of the left-wing Podemos party, proposed the Spanish and Catalan government try to agree on a mediator while the FC Barcelona football club said it had joined other groups in Catalonia seeking a negotiated solution.Spanish media reports said the Catalan regional government had been in touch with senior church figures to sound out the possibility of them playing a mediating role.But the Spanish government rejected mediation.Rajoy told Iglesias that Puigdemont had to give up the idea of unilaterally declaring independence, a government source said. “That is not negotiable. You can’t deal with people who plan to blackmail the state so brutally,” the source added.Rajoy, a conservative who has taken a hard line on Catalan independence, is considering the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering regional elections, ruling party lawmakers say.But he is struggling to secure support from across the traditional political divide - a lack of consensus that could compound Spain’s worst political crisis for decades.In a sign that Spanish police reinforcements sent to Catalonia might be there for an extended stay, an army logistics unit sent bunkbeds, kitchens and showers to an army barracks near Barcelona in case the police need to use the military base at some point, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said.Some police staying at hotels in Catalonia have come under pressure from local residents to leave.Spain has been jolted by the Catalan vote and the Spanish police response to it, with batons and rubber bullets used to prevent people voting. Hundreds were injured in scenes that brought international condemnation.Catalans came out onto the streets on Tuesday to condemn the police action, shutting down traffic, public transport and businesses, and stoking fears about intensifying unrest in a region that makes up one-fifth of the Spanish economy.“As a businessman, as a Spaniard and as a person, I am very worried and I am scared by what’s going on (in Catalonia),” said Juan Roig, chairman of Spain’s biggest food retailer Mercadona.Pro-independence parties that control the Catalan government staged the referendum in defiance of a Constitutional Court ruling that the vote violated Spain’s 1978 constitution, which states that the country is indivisible.Catalonia has its own language and culture and a political movement for secession that has strengthened in recent years.Outside Catalonia, most Spaniards appear strongly opposed to its independence drive.Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence. But a majority wanted a referendum to be held, and the violent police crackdown angered Catalans across the divide."

862,"LAS VEGAS: A sombre President Donald Trump visited Las Vegas on Wednesday to express the sorrow and shock felt by a nation reeling from the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, telling those whose loved ones died, “You’re not alone.”Sunday night’s attack — by a gunman who killed 58 people and wounded more than 500 before killing himself — “fills America’s heart with grief”, Trump said. “America is truly a nation in mourning.”Trump’s remarks came at the end of a visit to the city, during which the president and First Lady Melania Trump met with survivors of the shooting spree, doctors, law enforcement officers and other first responders.Speaking at the Las Vegas Police Department’s command centre, Trump addressed those grieving over the loss of loved ones in the attack.“We know that your sorrow feels endless. We stand together to help you carry your pain,” Trump said. “You’re not alone. We will never leave your side.”The day served as yet another test of Trump’s capacity to serve as the nation’s comforter-in-chief, coming after he travelled to storm-battered Puerto Rico a day earlier.There, he occasionally veered from expressions of sympathy, as when he said the recovery from Hurricane Maria was blowing the US budget “a little out of whack”.But in Las Vegas, Trump stayed on message and tried, at times, to elevate his rhetoric.“We cannot be defined by the evil that threatens us or the violence that incites such terror,” he said. “We’re defined by our love, our caring, and our courage. In the darkest moments, what shines most brightly is the goodness that thrives in the hearts of our people.”Earlier in the day, Trump praised the bravery of survivors who risked their lives to help other victims as bullets rained down from a nearby hotel during the shooting spree.At University Medical Center in Las Vegas, Trump said he met with some patients who were “very, very badly wounded, and they were badly wounded because they refused to leave. They wanted to help others because they saw people going down all over”.Trump’s trip to the city was the first time he has had to deal directly with the aftermath of a major shooting of the types that have killed hundreds of people in recent years in the United States.At the hospital, however, Trump deflected a question about whether the United States has a problem with gun violence.“We’re not going to talk about that today,” he said.Stephen Paddock — a 64-year-old retiree who reportedly had a stash of weapons worth thousands of dollars at his home — was identified as the gunman in the attack, spraying bullets at an open-air concert from the window of his suite in the high-rise Mandalay Bay hotel.Paddock killed himself as police closed in.Trump’s motorcade passed the hotel during the drive to the hospital.In a visit with law enforcement officers, Trump asked Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo whether the investigation had made progress in determining Paddock’s motive for the attack.“It’s still a little bit soon,” Lombardo replied. “We have a couple of good leads. … We are going to get there.”"

Across the capital, 69 people were saved from the wreckage of the 39 buildings that collapsed.But no one had been found alive since September 22, and hopes that miracle survivors would be located beneath the rubble gradually faded.The last lives saved turned out to be two dogs and a parrot found nearly a week after the quake.The nationwide death toll stands at 366 people, with the largest number killed in Mexico City.President Enrique Pena Nieto was due to address the nation later Wednesday on rebuilding after the quake and another on September 7 that together caused an estimated $2 billion in damage."

Global warming reduces crop yields, threatening global food security and push millions into poverty.labour force. Global warming reduces crop yields, threatening global food security and push millions into poverty.Speaking to Geo News, Abrar elaborated: “My work requires crossing disciplinary boundaries from natural science (understanding climate change), social science (how people are impacted and how they react) to management science (how responses are planned and organised). The research is close to my heart and touches on the bigger reality of how we can live in and adapt to an unpredictable and changing world with an ever-increasing population”The PHD has already been translated into several high-level journal publications, working papers and blogs.The award committee praised his research noting: ""It was extremely impressed with the novelty of the dissertation, the setting and detailed data and analyses, as well as the important practical implications of the work.”Abrar said: “I am delighted to receive this award as a Pakistani and the recognition of my work in developing pragmatic solutions for tackling the wicked challenge of climate change in resource constraint countries. I look forward to continuing researching this important work in my home country of Pakistan, building on my strong association with Oxford University.”Abrar has an interesting and diverse career. He grew up and studied in Lahore, trained as a chartered accountant. He went on to lead one of the oldest Pakistani accountancy firms, set up by his grandfather who was the first member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan.Abrar’s passion for the environment drove him to get a doctorate in Environmental Change and Management, an MBA, and an MSc in Environmental Management from the University of Oxford.He told Geo News his inspiration for studying climate change came from the 2010 floods in Pakistan.“Pakistan experienced its worst ever natural disaster in 2010. One-fifth of the country was under flood-waters, displacing millions of people and causing damage at scale of billions of US dollars. Despite promises for better prevention and coping measures by the government, civil society, and the global community, there was little evidence of actions to create capacity for local populations to deal with environmental shocks and adapt to longer-term environmental change.""""As an accountant I understood numbers but not the science behind climate change and extreme events. I wanted to learn what causes climate change and why our response was so lackluster, despite Pakistan consistently ranked as one of the most climate-vulnerable places in the world.”“I took a leap of faith, stepped out of my comfortable professional life, enrolled myself in Oxford. I have never looked back”He added: “The Pakistani floods were an eye-opener to the size and complexity of the climate change challenge in Pakistan and developing countries in general, and the substantial gap in the means for effective responses.""""My research showed that effective responses requires combined and sustained efforts of many disparate actors, from governments offering strong policy frameworks, experts creating evidence-based knowledge on local threats to treasury and development partners offering complementary assets and resources. The post-flooding analysis in Pakistan highlighted that recognising the challenge and setting policy is not enough. If efforts are fragmented and uncoordinated, responses are unlikely to be effective, leading to recurring disasters.”Abrar divides his time between Pakistan and Oxford, focusing on identifying practical and implementable solutions for climate change in Pakistan."

868,"KOROLYOV: When the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite 60 years ago, it marked both the beginning of space exploration and the start of a race between Moscow and Washington.Sputnik, the tiny silver sphere with four spider leg-like antennae, showed off Soviet technological prowess.But German scientists -- who had worked on Adolf Hitler´s rocket projects and had been brought to the USSR after the war -- were the ones who stood at the forefront of space achievement.The founder of the Soviet space programme, Sergei Korolyov, worked with German scientists and fragments of the German FAU rocket to develop a new military missile, said Nikolai Shiganov, one of the scientists behind Soviet rocket R-7 which put Sputnik into orbit.""The Korolyov bureau had to create an intercontinental rocket capable of carrying a hydrogen bomb to any point on the planet,"" Shiganov, now aged 97, told AFP in an interview.As he worked for the military, Korolyov -- who spent six years in the Gulag -- dreamt of space conquest. But time was running out: one of the principal German engineers, Wernher von Braun, was already working for the Americans.After three years of work and three rocket accidents, the fourth R-7 with a dummy warhead successfully hit its target in Kamchatka, in the Far East, in August 1957. The test was hailed as successful although the rocket head disintegrated in flight.Creating a new rocket head would take six months, much too long as the Soviets wanted to pre-empt the launch of a US satellite in 1958. So Korolyov suggested creating a simple satellite made of two hemispheres containing sensors, a radio and a battery pack.In just two months, the apparatus measuring 58 centimetres (22 inches) in diameter and weighing 83.6 kilogrammes (184.3 pounds) was ready, remembered Shiganov, whose lab created the aluminium alloy and came up with a new welding technique used to make the Sputnik and the R-7.Though the satellite captured imaginations, with radio amateurs tuning in around the world to hear its simple calls, Sputnik was secondary to its inventors, Shiganov said.""The most important thing was that it proved the effectiveness of the R-7 rocket.""The secrecy around the project meant Shiganov didn´t learn of the actual launch until he heard on the radio that the first Earth satellite was put in orbit on October 4, 1957, from a testing range in Kazakhstan, the future Baikonur cosmodrome.On a sunny October Sunday, Shiganov was able to see the glint of Sputnik with his naked eye.""It was a tiny dot which shone in the sun because of its glossy surface,"" he said.Sputnik was in orbit for 92 days, making 1,440 circles around Earth, before losing speed and burning up in the atmosphere. Several replicas are now on show in museums.Shiganov´s colleague Eduard Bolotov, 84, actually saw Sputnik as a young rocket trajectory engineer of 24, even gaining access to the depot where the rocket stood during final preparations.The minuscule satellite sat atop the rocket and Bolotov, with other young specialists, patted the rocket´s side and signed his name on the inside of the nozzle.""I watched the actual launch through a gap from my post,"" Bolotov said.Although workers were summoned to the launchpad with secret letters, crowds of people also turned up, he said. ""Their relatives had told them about the launch.""""Only at 3 am we found out that Sputnik was in orbit, and radios all over the world started to register its beeps.""""Then we went back to our dorms and drank pure alcohol for the victory of our rocket,"" he said. "

Even he was not aware of what lay ahead for him in the four-nation tournament.Cricket was changing in 1996. Sri Lanka had just won the World Cup, due to the explosive batting of Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana. Jayasuriya plundered Pakistan’s experienced bowling attack to score the fastest hundred in 48 balls and a ‘50 in 18’, during a tournament in Singapore, a month after the World Cup.Pakistan needed a pinch-hitter and the collective prayers of the team, management, and the nation were answered in the very next outing between the two countries.It was 21 years back when Sahibzada Mohammad Shahid Khan Afridi made his debut against Kenya. He was not required to bat, remained wicket-less, but took a catch in that match. Waqar Younis, after witnessing him bat in the nets, asked Saeed Anwar to try him at the top of the order. Everybody knows that he scored a century on 37 balls, smashing 11 sixes, but only a few remember that the innings was not televised in Pakistan.The score of 371, the second-highest total ever scored in a one-day international, was nothing short of a miracle to achieve against the then World Champions.The match, which virtually had no importance, became the talk of the town. In the pre-internet days, I started calculating the runs, before searching for ‘Afridi’. If you subtract 102 from 371, it gives you 269.At least one other batsman must have scored a hundred, but who could that be? Saeed Anwar and Ramiz Raja were ‘prime suspects’ as both had scored hundreds last year, and were with the team. Saeed had eight hundreds as compared to Ramiz’s nine. It was not until the next morning that we came to know that it was Saeed Anwar who did it, with a six and 13 fours. The score-card, on the extreme column of the newspaper, was the only information of the match available.Sri Lanka would have qualified for the final, had it scored 290. Saqlain Mushtaq and Waqar Younis had already taken four wickets in the innings and the match came to a very tight situation. 11 runs were required from the last four deliveries, with the last pair on the crease.Chaminda Vaas was facing Waqar Younis, who was reliable in such situations. Vaas hit Waqar for a six and a four but was bowled with one ball remaining, when the score was 289.In days of satellite, the match was surprisingly not shown on any sports channel. My eyes turned to Rainbow Centre, the hub for video cassettes of every type, in downtown Saddar market of Karachi and a search started for the ‘record-shattering’ match. On my first trip to the now defunct Pakistan Sports, I was told that print would be available in a week’s time. Until then, Afridi was back in Karachi, and magazines like ‘Akhbar-e-Watan’, ‘The Cricketer’, ‘Cricketer Urdu,’ and ‘Cricket Herald’ had him on their covers. The 16-year-old became the most sought-after commodity for the press.In his fifth ODI, he took 37 deliveries, again, to score 66 runs against Zimbabwe in Lahore. This innings had eight fours and four sixes and yes, it was witnessed by many on the television. By then, we had acquired the VHS recording of the ‘fastest century’. The cassette became a hot cake in the neighbourhood. The sixes were huge, the boy was cute, and the innings was short, it seemed like one was watching the highlights. Afridi’s unconventional hits were being discussed everywhere. Every gathering began with, ‘Yaar, tu nay Afridi wali innings dekhi?’ (friend, have you watched the Afridi-innings yet?). Every slogger had at least one six that they claimed matched Afridi’s and every spinner had a quicker one to dismiss settled batsmen.Afridi soon became a necessity for the team and ‘Lala’ for the nation. He was the ‘Player of the tournament’when Pakistan won the tri-nation series in Australia in January 1997. He was a leg-spinner who could turn the tables with his spin, his bat could blast through any attack on his day and he remained a panther in the outfield. He was a loose cannon throughout his career that no one could control.Yet with age, he got the experience required and the recent performances in the PSL are proof of that. He played an important role in Peshawar Zalmi's victory in PSL earlier this year. Let’s hope his addition makes a ‘boom boom’ difference to Karachi."
872,"With many carrots and some sticks, ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia seeks to tackle entrenched male attitudes towards women drivers before millions take the wheel, many for the first time, next June.For decades, hardliners cited austere Islamic interpretations to justify the ban on women, with some maintaining that they lacked the intelligence to drive and allowing them to do so would promote promiscuity.The ban finally ended last week, but many women fear they are still easy prey for conservatives in a nation where male ""guardians"" have arbitrary authority to take decisions on their behalf.""You can revoke the ban, but you cannot force men to allow their sisters and wives to drive,"" said a Saudi man with a private taxi company in Riyadh, declining to be named.""As head of my family, I make the decisions — not the women,"" he told AFP, expressing an aversion to his wife driving as that would mean more contact with unrelated men.Such views are hardly an anomaly in the gender-segregated kingdom, despite Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's stunning reform push that has sought to liberalise the kingdom and add more women to the workforce.""Expect more accidents"" because of women drivers, remarked one Saudi, echoing an avalanche of sexist comments on Twitter.Saudi authorities last week arrested a man who threatened a violent backlash against any female driver whose car breaks down.""I swear to God, I will burn her and her car,"" the man, wearing a traditional white robe, said in an online video.Such attitudes have prompted fears among some women that they will struggle to get licences or could be deliberately failed in driving tests.The government has preemptively addressed such concerns, with the interior ministry pledging to enforce the law by any means necessary.Riyadh is already moving to bring female driving instructors from abroad and establish driving schools exclusively for women.Authorities are also moving to criminalise sexual harassment with a new law, with flogging and jail terms as possible penalties.The Saudi media is also taking on the conservative opposition — with a dash of humour.""Driving has always been a minefield in the battle of the sexes... Sorry fellas but women are the better drivers,"" declared a recent graphic published in the English-language daily Arab News, citing research that male drivers are involved in more accidents.Newspaper editorials have argued that if women were allowed to ride camels in the time of the Prophet Mohammed then they should be allowed to drive ""modern-day camels"" — cars.Others have highlighted the economic benefits of the reform; Saudi families would no longer need foreign chauffeurs, often a major source of financial strain.Sabq online newspaper published a cartoon comparing the merits of two drivers: a scraggily dressed foreign man and a veiled Saudi woman.""Man: Salary. Housing. Bad Tempered. Knows your deepest secrets. Ruins your car,"" it said.""Woman: Love. Care. Consideration. Commitment.""But authorities are careful not to antagonise the sensitivities of hardline clerics.The Council of Senior Scholars, the kingdom's highest religious body that is close to the royal family, announced the majority of its members found that lifting the ban was ""permissible"".Experts say their approval -- after decades of opposition -- symbolises the government's tightening grip on the religious establishment that has long dominated Saudi politics.""It's unlikely that the scholars who consistently maintained that driving would damage ovaries, deprive (women) of their virginity and integrity had a sudden epiphany that their decades-old beliefs were wrong,"" said James Dorsey from Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.When the ban was lifted, several women's rights activists who long fought it alleged that authorities warned them not to make any public comments — seemingly not to highlight that activism can lead to reform.The government denies the claim.Ali Shihabi, from the Washington-based think tank Arab Foundation, said on Twitter that the government did not want activists to ""further provoke the conservatives who were already provoked by (the) driving decision"".The decision was led by Prince Mohammed, who styles himself as a reformer who will set the country on the road to modernity and civil liberty.But some experts have called the decision pure tokenism until the kingdom dismantles its rigid guardianship system.""Women still face a number of other hurdles,"" said research firm Capital Economics.""It may take many years for Saudi society to fully accept a greater role for women.""A Saudi executive at a multinational company in Riyadh said the main obstacle remains a prevailing ""village mentality"", although some patriarchs prefer having women drive themselves than be chauffeured around by unrelated men.""Women drivers will become a new normal and then people will say: 'How come we didn't allow this to happen sooner?'"""
873,"STOCKHOLM: Sweden on Wednesday said it had granted temporary residency to a 106-year-old bedridden and nearly blind Afghan woman, reversing an earlier decision to refuse her initial asylum request.""From a humanitarian perspective, it would be shocking to require her to travel to her home country,"" a migration court in the city of Gothenburg said, overruling the Swedish Migration Board´s rejection of her asylum request in May.The judges noted Bibikahl Uzbeki´s advanced age, declining health and her ""especially vulnerable situation"".The Migration Board, which does not comment on individual cases, told daily Svenska Dagbladet that ""in general, advanced age is not a reason to be granted protection.""In its country assessment report available on its website, the agency says that while the ""situation in Afghanistan remains serious"", the conflict ""has not reached such a level that every Afghan can obtain a residency permit.""The case of Uzbeki and her family has made headlines in Sweden, with the general public calling for Sweden to show kindness to the elderly woman — whose travels through Europe to reach the Scandinavian country were well-documented by the international media.Wednesday´s decision grants Uzbeki temporary residency for 13 months, after which she can apply for an extension.Her family members in Sweden have also appealed their asylum rejections.Sweden long pushed for Europe to keep its borders open to fleeing migrants but ended up closing its own borders after receiving 81,000 asylum applications in 2014 and 163,000 in 2015, a number that then plunged to around 30,000 in 2016."
874,"BRASILIA: The craze for tourists taking selfies alongside wild animals then posting on Instagram is fueling cruel treatment of iconic species in the Amazon, activists warn.The charity World Animal Protection said in a report that Instagram has seen a 292 percent increase in wildlife selfies since 2014 around the world. Of these, more than 40 percent involved humans ""hugging or inappropriately interacting with a wild animal.""World Animal Protection said in the report released Tuesday that the animals are captured and often battered to make them perform for tourism businesses.""Behind the scenes, these animals are often beaten into submission, taken from their mothers as babies and secretly kept in filthy, cramped conditions or repeatedly baited with food that can have a long-term negative impact on their biology and behaviour,"" the group said.""All too often, to the unsuspecting tourist, the cruelty that makes these animals submissive and available is entirely invisible.""The practice is rife in the Amazon region, with 61 percent of the species involved listed as needing international protection by the worldwide Convention on the Trade of Endangered Species, or CITES, according to the charity.In the Brazilian Amazon city of Manaus, for example, 18 tour companies said they offered opportunities on 94 percent of trips to ""hold and touch wild animals as photo props."" The most common selfie animal there is the pink river dolphin, then three-toed sloths, caimans, green anacondas and squirrel monkeys.""There is good reason to believe that most sloths being used for tourist selfies don´t survive even six months of this treatment,"" the report said.It listed examples of animals being kept in dire conditions for the selfie trade, including a manatee held in a small tank in front of a hotel and a giant anteater ""manhandled and beaten"" by its owner.Roberto Cabral, a coordinator for enforcement at the Brazilian environmental institute Ibama, told AFP that keeping animals for tourist selfies is illegal.In comparison to the scale of illegal trafficking of animals, the problem is ""minimal,"" he said.However, he also pleaded with visitors not to support the trend.""The irony is that the tourist who usually takes photos with an animal is the same tourist who likes animals but is now contributing to that animal´s distress,"" he said."

Computers are now able to paint masterpieces, write poetry, author a novel or a screenplay on their own. One of the five or so firms working in this area is baseH, a Pakistani company. On Monday, baseH announced the launch of an AI Writer, an artificially intelligent content generator, at their headquarters in Karachi. The non-human hack, named Dante, had already been writing Pakistan Stock Exchange closing reports. But starting this week, it would be used to pen small news reports after accessing and storing data from local and international media outlets. The company hopes that in the long run, AI will be able to act as a supplement, helping newspapers, channels and blogs by freeing up time for editors and reporters. “Our focus at the moment are media houses that can produce endless content with the same staff and in practically no time,” states the website, “The Dante A.I. writer has the capability to pick up the style of writing where it is being deployed as well as quickly adapt to new writing styles and set of editorial policies or preferences.” BaseH is a small company made up of young IT professionals. For their new project, software engineers from the NED University were also taken on board. Stories generated by the AI were sent for screening to senior Pakistani journalists. One of whom Geo.tv spoke to and he admitted that he could not tell the difference between a story by a human and one by a machine. Though Dante is not the first of its kind, it surely is one of the first entrants into an industry still in its embryonic stages."

878,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump has railed against a deal to curb Iran´s nuclear program, but officials say that far from scrapping it, he is considering kicking the decision to Congress.Ahead of an October 15 deadline, several officials familiar with White House deliberations told AFP Trump has made it clear he does not want to certify Iran´s compliance with the accord.The 2015-era Obama agreement offered Tehran relief from punitive economic sanctions, in return for limits to uranium enrichment and intrusive inspections.Every 90 days Trump must decide whether Iran is living up to its end of the bargain, something that has already caused him political pain on two occasions.The Trump administration has publicly accused Iran of violating the ""spirit"" of the accord — known as the JCPOA — although some officials privately admit there is a thin line between testing the limits and a material breach.Trump's top military advisor, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Joseph Dunford, has told Congress the briefings he has received ""indicate that Iran is adhering to its JCPOA obligations.""But Republicans are under domestic political pressure to fulfil campaign and donor promises to scrap the accord.Trump has called the deal an ""embarrassment to the United States"" and had urged allies and fellow signatories in London, Paris and Berlin to renegotiate it, something they are unwilling to do.But now a middle path is being explored, which would make Trump´s opposition clear, but stop short of scrapping the deal outright and perhaps clear the 90-day-review off his desk.Under the plan, Trump could find Iran in breach or - less provocatively - refuse to certify Tehran's compliance, giving Congress 60 days to decide whether to impose sanctions.The issue has prompted fierce debate inside the administration, and with this mercurial president, anything is still possible between now and the deadline.But ""it seems like he was leaning that way,"" said one official, echoing the accounts of others who refused to speak on the record, because of the sensitivity of the subject.Hawks are urging confrontation with Iran, while others warn of inflaming the Middle East and seriously damaging ties with European allies who consider the agreement in their vital national interest.Some aides are also warning against escalating tensions at a time when an analogous nuclear stand-off with North Korea worsens.The debate appeared to spill out into the open on Tuesday when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis contradicted Trump´s claim that the deal ""poses a direct national-security threat.""Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ""at this point in time, absent indication to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with.""Asked whether he believed the Iran deal was in the national interest, Mattis replied: ""Yes, senator, I do.""In kicking the ball to Congress, Trump could still open the door to rupturing the deal.Lawmakers could decide to impose sanctions that, if implemented, would shatter the terms of the international agreement and leave the United States in breach.In July, four influential Republican Senators — Tom Cotton, David Perdue, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio — sent a letter to the administration claiming Iran had broken the accord on four counts.Senator Cotton drove home his argument in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations Tuesday night, saying the ""sensible course"" was ""to decline to certify the deal and begin the work of strengthening it and counteracting Iranian aggression, with the threat of sanctions and military action if necessary.""But behind closed doors, the proposal is being greeted coolly by some Republicans on Capitol Hill, who have an already testy relationship with the president.A Congressional source said it was ""too early to say"" whether there would be enough support to pass sanctions.Much depends on how Trump frames their decision -- if he demands Congress do their job and sanction a ""nefarious"" Iran, then the pressure will grow.""I can absolutely see why the White House wants to kick it to Congress: the president gets the advantage of not certifying, but Congress has to take responsibility for what that means,"" said Kori Schake, formerly of the White House National Security Council and now the Hoover Institution.""It seems to be a questionable strategy for the White House to set in motion, where the president gets to be reckless but banks on Congress to act heroically and prevent disaster.""Doing so, she added, requires ""an awful lot of trust that the president won´t turn around and campaign against them for it.""The White House hopes to use the threat of sanctions to gather support for a harder international line on Iran.It would like to see curbs on Tehran´s ballistic missile program, an end to its support for militias across the Middle East and a revision of ""sunset clauses"" that would permanently end sanctions without a permanent end to the nuclear program.They are issues that allies believe should be addressed separately or in a successor agreement. There is also growing concern that if the deal survives, the same issue does not come every 90 days. "

884,"LAS VEGAS: Police and FBI agents, chasing down more than 1,000 dead-end leads since a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas, are seeking more help from the public in solving the central mystery of their investigation - the shooter’s motive.Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said investigators remain largely in the dark about what drove retired real estate investor and high-stakes gambler Stephen Paddock to carry out the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.“We have looked at everything, literally, to include the suspect’s personal life, any political affiliation, his social behaviors, economic situation, any potential radicalization,” McMahill told reporters late on Friday.“We have been down each and every single one of these paths, trying to determine why, to determine who else may have known of these plans.”McMahill acknowledged that Daesh had repeatedly claimed responsibility for the attack, but said investigators had uncovered “no nexus” between the Mideast-based militant group and Paddock.In an unusual bid to cast a wider net for tips, the FBI and police have arranged with communications company Clear Channel to post billboards around Las Vegas urging citizens to come forward with any information they believe might help investigators.The billboards will bear the slogan, “If you know something, say something,” and carry a toll-free number to an FBI hotline, said Aaron Rouse, special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office.The public appeal came a day before US Vice President Mike Pence was slated to join Mayor Carolyn Goodman and other local leaders at a City Hall commemoration for victims of the shooting, following a prayer walk through the city. President Donald Trump paid a visit to Las Vegas earlier in the week.Paddock, 64, unleashed a torrent of gunfire onto an outdoor music festival from the windows of his 32nd-floor hotel suite overlooking the concert on Sunday night, then shot himself to death before police stormed his room.In addition to the 58 people who died, nearly 500 were injured, some by gunfire, some trampled or otherwise hurt while running for cover.Unlike so many other perpetrators of deadly mass shootings before him, Paddock left behind no suicide note, no manifesto, no recordings and no messages on social media pointing to his intent, according to police.McMahill said investigators remained certain Paddock acted alone in the shooting. But police have said they suspect he had help before the killings, based on the large number of guns, ammunition and explosives found in the hotel suite, his home, his car and a second home searched in Reno.Authorities have said that 12 of the weapons recovered from Paddock’s hotel suite were equipped with so-called bump-stock devices that enable semi-automatic rifles to be operated as if they were fully automatic machine-guns.Paddock’s ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over the course of his 10-minute shooting spree was a major factor in the high casualty count, police said.The bloodshed might have lasted longer, with greater loss of life, but for a hotel security officer who was sent to check an open-door alarm on the 32nd floor, and discovered the gunman’s whereabouts after the shooting started, McMahill said.The security officer, Jesus Campos, was struck in the leg as the gunman strafed the hallway with gunfire from behind his door, apparently having detected Campos via surveillance cameras Paddock set up outside his hotel suite.Campos, though wounded, alerted the hotel’s dispatch, “which was absolutely critical to us knowing the location as well as advising the responding officers as they arrived on that 32nd floor,” McMahill said. “He’s an absolute hero.”In a new disclosure, authorities said two bullets Paddock fired struck a large jet fuel storage tank at the edge of the city’s main airport, about a block from the concert grounds, indicating an apparent attempt by the gunman to create even greater havoc.There was no explosion or fire from the two rounds, one of which penetrated the tank, as jet fuel in storage is almost impossible to ignite with gunshots, airport officials said on Friday.Paddock’s girlfriend, Marilou Danley, 62, was questioned by the FBI on Wednesday and said in a statement she never had any inkling of Paddock’s plans.Danley, who returned late on Tuesday from a family visit to the Philippines, is regarded by investigators as a “person of interest.” The Australian citizen of Filipino heritage is cooperating fully with authorities, her lawyer said."

Left or right?Pakistan’s armed forces, its government and it public all have their own opinions about the direction we, as a nation, should take. A European diplomat once said that our country was lucky for being repeatedly given a chance, but its decision makers were unlucky for repeatedly choosing the wrong path.Will we keep moving in circles, or this time will wisdom finally prevail?Post the 1998 elections, politician and crusading democrat, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, may God bless his soul, advised President Ghulam Ishaq Khan that the right way forward is the one that is easy to see and easy to travel upon, but only if ill-intentions and personal motives do not hide it from view. Those remarks were delivered at a time when the Pakistan People’s Party had won 94 general election seats in comparison to the 56 bagged by its rival, the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad. Ishaq has a decision to make about who had the right to rule. But prejudice blinded the president, and obscured from his view the right way forward. 70 years on, we are yet again besieged by the same question: Does democracy work? Should a presidential form of government replace our parliamentary one? Do we need accountability before we can hold elections? These questions are a waste of our time, especially since they have been answered by the founder of our nation, Jinnah, who always spoke against dictatorship and in support of democratic credentials. In fact, he laid down the foundations of a parliamentary democracy in Pakistan. Even if the late Sharifuddin Pirzada is to be believed, whose recently discovered diary claims Jinnah was in favor of a presidential system, the Quaid had never stated so publicly.As for accountability, that process should continue without putting off polling. Remember 1977, when a 90-day delay in elections tuned into an 11 year one? That mistake should never be repeated.The debate – civilian government or martial law – is a little outdated now. Even those who can impose military rule are now themselves aware of its drawbacks. A nuclear-armed state, with a well-regarded professional army, needs to keep its assets well hidden from the prying eyes of outsiders, who might not be friends. This how the world around us is progressing and we should keep up. This is what our founder believed in and this is what our constitution states.There was something else Jinnah did in the early years of Pakistan; he laid down the ground rules for our foreign policy. Such as our approach regarding the Kashmir Valley, our friendly ties with other Muslim countries, our aid and relations with the United States, were all tirelessly outlined by Jinnah, despite his frailty and ill-health.To promote better ties with America, Jinnah appointed Mirza Hassan Isphani as Pakistan’s first ambassador to the United States. In fact even before Pakistan’s birth, our Quaid had announced that the US would provide aid. After Pakistan was created, he wrote to the US president asking for assistance. From the start, Jinnah’s US policy gave us benefits, while abandoning it has only resulted in problems.But there is still time for us to form an America-centric policy along the lines of what Jinnah envisioned, of course after prioritizing our national interests.There is also more to learn from the father of our nation: his behavior towards opponents. Today, we make allegations of treachery against our rivals, call for fatwas to be declared against them, which is very unlike the man we call our Quaid. Despite facing opposition from Ghaffar Khan, Jinnah personally met him. Maulana Maudoodi, another critic, was allowed to carry on with his program on Radio Pakistan.It was only after his death, in 1949, that the first accountability law, the Public and Representative Office (Disqualification) Act (Proda), was introduced, using which Abdul Sattar Pirzada, Hussain Shaheed Suharwardy, Muhammad Ayub Khuhro and Zulfiqar Ali Khan Mamdot were disqualified. It took another five years for the parliamentarians to finally bin the damaging legislation. Then-prime minister, Mohammad Ali Bogra, declared the law null and void in retrospective enactment, thus rendering all disqualifications under it to be reversed. An interesting fact here is that all these disqualifications came about through the courts and were reversed by an executive decision. An act which incensed the Governor General Ghulam Muhammad who in response dissolved the parliament.We seem to be headed down the same path. It would be apt to remember that history today remembers Mamdot, Khoro and Suharwardy with glowing tributes while it isn’t too kind to Ghulam Muhammad.Now, on to some other questions. Is the war against terrorism Pakistan’s fight? Were we harmed by internal terrorism? While the state is clear about waging a war against terrorists, it is still unclear about its jihadi assets. There is much talk today about cleaning up our house. But then there are some who believe our house is already clean. General Jahangir Karamat had famously said that our jihadi policy is past its expiry date. The world does not look upon it favorably either.And let’s be clear, we cannot fight the entire world.Khawaja Asif, Pakistan’s newly appointed foreign minister insists we need time to bring our house in order. But by delaying it, will the problem disappear? To solve such crises we need to unite and be brave. Both things seem out of bounds for a government many call ‘weak’ under Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.Delay in holding elections will benefit no one. Holding them on time will ensure that whoever comes on board next can help solve these problems. But it seems like this remaining year will be spent watching a tussle unfold between Nawaz Sharif and some very powerful forces. With new polls the voters would tell Pakistan who they favor and eventually the back and forth will subside.Personally, I have my doubts about whether Abbasi, even with his considerable hard work, will be able to take this government past the finishing line a year from now. The best solution for all parties is to call for early elections, as soon as possible. Whenever democracy is in trouble, elections are the way out, and that is true even today. We are at a low, with regards to our foreign policy. This is the time to remember Jinnah, keep in mind the national interest, global peace and move forward.Note: The views expressed in the article are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."
889,"MOSCOW: Some 120 Daesh fighters and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Russian air strikes in Syria over the past 24 hours, the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday.The ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders including Omar al-Shishani had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier Russian strike.""A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 (Daesh) fighters including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen,"" the ministry said, adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal.Mayadeen is one of the Daesh's last bastions in Syria.In another air strike, more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union, Tunisia, and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor.The ministry said ""large numbers of foreign mercenaries"" were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq.It also said Russian forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar al-Shishani, Alaa al-din al-Shishani and Salah al-Din al-Shishani, all natives of the Northern Caucasus.Moscow reported their deaths after taking ""several days"" to confirm the results of an earlier strike on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed an IS command post with more than 30 fighters including the natives of the Northern Caucasus.The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani, one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard.Shishani, whose nom de guerre means ""Omar the Chechen,"" came from the former Soviet state of Georgia's Pankisi Gorge region, which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens.He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006, and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008.He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh.The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for further comment.Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, disagreed with Moscow's report.""Salah al-Din al-Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by militant groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander, and his militant group is allied with the militants of the Al-Nusra front but only in their fight against the regime,"" he said.""He has no links with IS.""The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Russian and coalition air raids.Moscow has been staging air strikes in support of its ally Damascus targeting both Daesh in Deir Ezzor province and rival militantss led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate in Idlib province in the northwest."

891,"MADRID: Spain braced for mass street protests Saturday as anger swelled against Catalan leaders' vows to declare their region independent and the national government´s handling of the volatile political crisis.Tentative signs have emerged that the sides may be seeking to defuse the crisis after Madrid offered the first apology Friday to Catalans injured by police in a crackdown on their outlawed independence vote on October 1.But uncertainty still haunted the country as Catalan leaders have not backed off from plans to make a unilateral declaration of independence within days, based on the result of the banned referendum vote.""There has to be a commitment to dialogue,"" said Jordi Cuixart, president of one of the grassroots groups driving Catalonia´s separatist movement, on Catalan radio on Saturday.""We will never refuse that. But we... will continue to demand a commitment that the referendum law be fulfilled.""Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has vowed to block independence as well as any referendum.And he has rejected calls for mediation in a dispute that has drawn cries of concern all over Spain, and even from Barcelona and Real Madrid footballers.Spain's deepest political crisis in decades has raised fears of further unrest in the northeastern region, a tourist-friendly area of 7.5 million people that accounts for a fifth of Spain´s economy.Opponents of secession called for demonstrations around Spain on Saturday and a major rally in Barcelona on Sunday.A movement called ""Let´s Talk"" urged citizens to gather dressed in white in front of town halls across the country, demanding dialogue to end the crisis under the slogan: ""Spain is better than its leaders"".""It´s time to come together to tell them that they are incapable and irresponsible,"" the group´s manifesto reads. The gatherings will start from around midday (1000 GMT).A separate ""patriotic"" march was called for the same time in central Madrid, organised by activists defending the unity of Spain.Friday saw the first signs the sides may be willing to step back from the brink in a political conflict that risks destabilising Europe.After days of ill-tempered rhetoric, the central government said it regretted the injuries and suggested Catalonia should hold a regional election to settle the crisis.Catalan government minister Santi Vila, a close of ally of regional president Carles Puigdemont, meanwhile told broadcaster Rac1 that his side could consider a ""ceasefire"" in the dispute, to avoid a further crackdown by Madrid.Businesses and the government have kept up economic pressure on Catalonia however, with several big companies announcing moves to shift their headquarters to other parts of Spain.Puigdemont had been due to appear at the regional parliament on Monday but postponed it by a day, a spokesman said, gaining time and easing tensions.It remains unclear what he plans to say, although some leaders are hoping he will use the opportunity to make a declaration of independence.Spain´s central government apologised on behalf of police to people hurt in Sunday´s referendum disturbances.""I can do nothing but regret it, apologise on behalf of the officers who intervened,"" said the government´s representative in Catalonia, Enric Millo.Central government spokesman Ignacio Mendez de Vigo also said he ""regretted"" the injuries.""It would be good to start mending this fracture... through regional elections,"" he told a news conference.In Madrid meanwhile, Catalonia´s police chief and two prominent separatist leaders including Cuixart avoided being remanded in custody at a court hearing Friday over sedition accusations.Spain´s Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the suspension of a session scheduled for Monday in the Catalan parliament at which some leaders have called for an independence declaration.If Catalonia declares independence, Spain could respond by suspending the region´s existing autonomous status and imposing direct rule from Madrid.On another front, the government in Madrid pushed ahead with a measure to pressure Catalonia economically.It passed a decree to make it quicker for businesses to shift their legal domiciles away from one region to another.With its own language and cultural traditions, demands for independence in Catalonia date back centuries but have surged during recent years of economic crisis.The Catalan government on Friday published final results from the referendum indicating that 90 percent of voters backed the idea of breaking away from Spain.Turnout was 43 per cent.Recent polls had indicated that Catalans are split on independence, though leaders said the violence during the referendum turned many against the state authorities."
892,"PARIS: People, it seems, have never been so afraid of their food -- and, say some experts, an obsession with healthy eating may paradoxically be endangering lives.Twenty-nine-year-old Frenchwoman Sabrina Debusquat recounts how, over 18 months, she became a vegetarian, then a vegan -- eschewing eggs, dairy products, and even honey -- before becoming a ""raw foodist"" who avoided all cooked foods, and ultimately decided to eat just fruit.It was only when her deeply worried boyfriend found clumps of her hair in the bathroom sink and confronted her with the evidence that she realised that she was on a downward path.""I thought I held the truth to food and health, which would allow me to live as long as possible,"" said Debusquat.""I wanted to get to some kind of pure state. In the end, my body overruled my mind.""For some specialists, the problem is a modern eating disorder called orthorexia nervosa.Someone suffering from orthorexia is ""imprisoned by a range of rules which they impose on themselves,"" said Patrick Denoux, a professor in intercultural psychology at the University of Toulouse-Jean Jaures.These very strict self-enforced laws isolate the individual from social food gatherings and in extreme cases, can also endanger health.Paris nutritionist Sophie Ortega said she had one patient who was going blind due to deficiency of vitamin B12, which is needed to make red blood cells.B12 is not made by the body, and most people get what they need from animal-derived foods such as eggs, dairy products, meat or fish or from supplements.""A pure, unbending vegan,"" her patient even refused to take the supplements, said Ortega. ""It was as if she preferred to lose her sight... rather than betray her commitment to animals.""'Disease disguised as virtue'The term orthorexia nervosa was coined in the 1990s by the then alternative medicine practitioner Steven Bratman, a San Francisco-based physician.To be clear, orthorexia is not an interest in healthy eating -- it´s when enthusiasm becomes a pathological obsession, which leads to social isolation, psychological disturbance, and even physical harm. In other words, as Bratman said in a co-authored book in 2000, it´s ""a disease disguised as a virtue.""But as is often the case in disorders that may have complex psychological causes, there is a strong debate as to whether the condition really exists.The term is trending in western societies, prompting some experts to wonder whether it is being fanned by ""cyber-chondria"" -- self-diagnosis on the internet.Orthorexia is not part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, set down by mental health professionals in the United States that is also widely used as a benchmark elsewhere. The fifth edition of this ""bible,"" published in 2013, includes anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, but not orthorexia.""The term orthorexia was proposed as a commonly used term but it is not medically recognised,"" said Pierre Dechelotte, head of nutrition at Rouen University Hospital in northern France and head of a research unit investigating the link between the brain and the intestines in food behaviour.Even so, says Dechelotte, it has a home in the family of ""restrictive food-related disorders -- but it´s not on the radar screen.""Alain Perroud, a psychiatrist who has worked in France and Switzerland over the course of a 30-year career, says orthorexia ""is much closer to a phobia"" than to a food disorder.As with other phobias, the problem may be tackled by cognitive behavioural therapy -- talking about incorrect or excessive beliefs, dealing with anxiety-provoking situations and using relaxation techniques and other methods to tackle anxiety, he suggested.Denoux contends that between two and three percent of the French population suffer from orthorexia, but stresses that there is a lack of reliable data as the condition has not been officially recognised.Denoux´s figure seems coherent to Dechelotte, who says that women seem to be more than twice as susceptible to the problem as men.Outside the world of clinicians, orthorexia seems to be creeping into wider usage.American blogger Jordan Younger has helped to popularise the term, documenting her own painful downward spiral -- since reversed -- into unhealthy living.On her blog, she describes it as ""a bubble of restriction,"" obsessing over a diet that was ""entirely vegan, entirely plant-based, entirely gluten-free, oil-free, refined sugar-free, flour-free, dressing/sauce-free, etc.""Those who seem to be most worried about healthy food are often concerned about food scandals in the West, Pascale Hebel from the Paris-based CREDOC research centre told AFP.Over nearly three decades, Europe has experienced a string of food safety scandals -- beginning with mad-cow disease and continuing recently with insecticide-contaminated eggs -- as well as mounting opposition to the use of antibiotics, genetically modified foods and corporate farming practices.The disorder reflects a craving for control, suggested Denoux: food is seen as a form of medicine to fix a western lifestyle that may be seen as polluting or toxic.""We are living through a time of change in our food culture, which has led us to fundamentally doubt what we are eating,"" said Denoux.Among believers, this ""suspicion of being poisoned is deemed proof of insight."" "

894,"LAHORE: Former prime minister and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday ordered an inquiry against those responsible for making the amendment to the finality of Prophethood declaration in nomination papers.Nawaz formed a three-member inquiry committee to identify those responsible for the amendment. The inquiry committee will be headed by Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, other members of the committee are Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal and federal minister Mushahidullah Khan.The inquiry committee will submit its report to Nawaz after 24 hours. The former premier has expressed concern at the incident, said spokesman Asif Kirmani.   Kirmani added that strict action will be taken against those responsible.On Friday, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that even thinking of amending the finality of Prophethood clause is a sin.Jihad is the prerogative of the state and no one else, says interior minister“Even thinking of amending this law is kufr,” said Iqbal while addressing a press conference.“We are all Muslims. The finality of Prophethood is our part of our faith,” said the interior minister.He also denied allegations that the clause was removed from the newly passed act.On October 5, the National Assembly unanimously passed amendments to the Election Bill 2017, restoring Khatm-i-Naboowat (finality of Prophethood) declaration required to be signed by public office holders to its original form.The controversy arose when the ruling party passed amendments to the election law, with opposition parties claiming the bill moved by the government had also changed the contents of a form regarding belief in Khatm-i-Naboowat (finality of Prophethood), which is required to be signed by public office holders and election candidates.The amendments passed were agreed upon by members of parliamentary parties after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had accepted the government had made a 'clerical error' and invited them to discuss the matter in his chamber.During the meeting, the parliamentary leaders agreed to restore the declaration to the original form it was in before the National Assembly passed the Elections Bill 2017 on Tuesday. "

896,"MANAGUA: Hurricane Nate was expected to strengthen on Saturday and make landfall, threatening the US central Gulf Coast with strong winds and storm surges after killing at least 25 people in Central America.Nate, a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest on a five-category scale used by meteorologists, was churning toward the central Gulf of Mexico as New Orleans evacuated some residents from areas outside its levee system.""Nate is at our doorstep or will be soon,"" New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said.The greatest threat from this particular storm is not rain, but strong winds and storm surge, Landrieu said.The winds could cause significant power outages, and storm surges are projected to be six to nine feet (1.8 to 2.7 meters) high, he added.""We have been through this many, many times. There is no need to panic,"" Landrieu told a news conference.The storm brushed by Mexico´s Yucatan peninsula, home to beach resorts such as Cancun and Playa del Carmen, as it headed north, the US National Hurricane Center in Miami said.Nate packed maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour (130 kmh) and was about 420 miles (675 km) south-southeast of the Mississippi river on Saturday as it was expected to strengthen, the NHC said.In the United States, a state of emergency was declared for 29 Florida counties and states near Nate´s path - Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi - as well as the city of New Orleans, which was devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.The NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle, Louisiana to the Alabama-Florida border.""By Saturday noon you should be in your safe place,"" Alabama Governor Kay Ivey told a news conference.""This is a fast-moving storm and we must begin preparing now.""Nearly three-quarters of US Gulf of Mexico oil production was offline ahead of the storm, and more oil companies halted operations on Friday.On Friday evening, Nate was moving north-northwest at 22 miles per hour (35 kmh), a fast pace which if maintained could mean the storm does less damage when it hits land.The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 12 people in Nicaragua, nine in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador, local authorities said.Thousands were forced to evacuate their homes and Costa Rica´s government declared a state of emergency.Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis urged residents to remain vigilant, noting rains would likely resume.In Honduras, residents wondered whether they would have to flee. Norma Chavez and her two children anxiously watched a river rise outside their home in Tegucigalpa, the capital.""We are worried that it will grow more and carry away the house,"" said Chavez, 45.Through Monday, Nate is expected to produce two to four inches (5 to 10 cm) more rain in eastern Yucatan and western Cuba and three to six inches (8 to 15 inches) in the US central Gulf Coast.About 71 percent of US Gulf of Mexico oil production and 53 percent of natural gas output is offline ahead of Nate´s arrival, the US Department of the Interior´s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said on Friday.Oil companies have evacuated staff from 66 platforms and five drilling rigs, it said.Oil production equaling 1.24 million barrels of crude per day is offline, according to BSEE."
897,"KARACHI: The country’s flagship carrier Pakistan International Airlines will be discontinuing flights to the United States from October 31, airline officials said.According to the officials, PIA has been incurring losses of up to Rs1.25 billion annually due to its flight operations to the US – a concern which prompted the management to discontinue the flights. The airline is no longer booking US flights through its reservation system after October 31.PIA had been operating flights to the US since 1961 without any disruption. A total of five weekly flights to New York and three other US cities were being operated.Sources privy to the matter said the airline had decided several times in the past to discontinue US flights due to the financial losses; however, it faced ‘political pressure’ each time, which hindered its plans. Some politicians holding dual citizenship, top government officials and pilots exerted ‘pressure’ on the airline not to stop its US flight operations. These flights were ‘beneficial’ to the politicians and officials, the sources said.PIA, after stopping direct flights to the US, will enter into a code-sharing agreement with an American airline. US-bound passengers will be flown to London, where they will then be transferred to the American airline which will take them to the US, the sources said. Such a code-sharing agreement will help PIA to avoid financial losses, the sources added. The PIA management has also decided to axe surplus staff, sources close to the matter said.The airline is expected to cut more than 500 jobs under the latest plan."
898,"WASHINGTON: The US government has approved the sale to Saudi Arabia of the advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system for $15 billion, the State Department said Friday.""This sale furthers US national security and foreign policy interests, and supports the long-term security of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region in the face of Iranian and other regional threats,"" a statement said.The green light for the deal, which Saudi Arabia has long sought, came one day after King Salman met Russia´s President Vladimir Putin and signed a preliminary agreement to look at Moscow´s S-400 air defense system.The THAAD -- which has already been supplied to Saudi Arabia´s neighbors Qatar and the United Arab Emirates -- is one of the most capable defensive missile batteries in the US arsenal and comes equipped with an advanced radar system.Its recent deployment by the US military in South Korea to protect against any North Korean strike drew protests from Beijing, who feared its sensors would be able to penetrate into Chinese air space and upset the balance of power.The State Department said it would advise Congress that, in Saudi hands, the system would act to stabilize the situation in the Gulf and help defend US forces in the region and their allies, who face a growing Iranian missile capability. ""The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region,"" it said.Officials told AFP that the sale, which can go ahead if the US Congress does not object within 30 days, should be seen as part of an overall $110 billion arms package that President Donald Trump promised the Saudi kingdom during a visit in May.""This potential sale will substantially increase Saudi Arabia´s capability to defend itself against the growing ballistic missile threat in the region,"" a statement said.""THAAD´s exo-atmospheric, hit-to-kill capability will add an upper-tier to Saudi Arabia´s layered missile defense architecture.""The main US contractors who will profit from the sale are aerospace giant Lockheed Martin´s space systems division and defense contractor Raytheon."

903,"MOSCOW: North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile which it believes can reach the west coast of the United States, a Russian lawmaker just returned from a visit to Pyongyang was quoted as saying on Friday.Anton Morozov, a member of the Russian lower house of parliament´s international affairs committee, and two other Russian lawmakers visited Pyongyang on Oct. 2-6, Russia´s RIA news agency reported.""They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States,"" RIA quoted Morozov as saying.""As far as we understand, they intend to launch one more long-range missile in the near future. And in general, their mood is rather belligerent.""Tensions have risen in recent weeks over North Korea´s nuclear weapons and missile programs as Pyongyang has test-fired several missiles and conducted what it said was a test explosion of a hydrogen bomb as it advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the US mainland.Morozov´s comments drove up the price of US Treasury bonds, as investors, worried about the prospect of new North Korean missile tests, moved into assets the market views as a safe haven in times of uncertainty.Reuters was not able to independently verify Morozov´s account, and he did not specify which North Korean officials had given him the information about the planned test.In Washington, a US official said that there had been indications that North Korea could be preparing for a missile test on or around Oct. 10, the anniversary of the founding of the ruling Korean Workers Party and a day after the Columbus Day holiday in the United States.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not disclose the type of missile that could be tested and cautioned that North Korea in the past has not staged launches despite indications that it would.A senior CIA analyst, speaking at a conference in Washington this week, said the North Korean government likely would stage some kind of provocation on Oct. 10 but did not elaborate on what form it might take.“There is a clarity of purpose in what (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is doing. I don’t think he’s done,"" said Yong Suk Lee, the deputy assistant director of the CIA’s Korea Mission Center, which was set up this year.'Kim Jong-Un is a rational politician and US needs to understand that to deal with the nuclear-armed country'""In fact, I told my own staff (that) October 10th is the Korean Workers Party founding day. That’s Tuesday in North Korea, but Monday – the Columbus Day holiday - in the United States. So stand by your phones.”Morozov´s delegation had ""high-level"" meetings in Pyongyang, RIA news agency said, citing the Russian embassy in the North Korean capital.Tensions over North Korea´s nuclear programme have been running high in recent weeks since Pyongyang staged a series of missile tests, and conducted a text explosion on Sept. 3 of what it said was a hydrogen bomb.There has also been an exchange of tough rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington. US President Donald Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it threatens the United States.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un responded by calling Trump deranged and saying he would pay dearly for his threat.China, North Korea´s main ally, has backed sanctions against Pyongyang and on Saturday in response to the Nobel Peace Prize being awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said it backed a worldwide ban on nuclear weapons.“China has always supported a complete and total ban on nuclear weapons, but also believes that the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament cannot be achieved overnight and must advance gradually within the existing disarmament mechanism. China is willing to work with all parties to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world,"" said China’s foreign ministry.Morozov is a member of the LDPR, a right-wing populist party. It casts itself as an opposition party, but hews close to the Kremlin line on matters of international affairs.Describing meetings with North Korean officials, Morozov said they ""displayed serious determination and bellicose rhetoric,"" RIA reported.""The situation, of course, demands the swiftest intervention of all interested states, particularly those represented in the region, in order to prevent wide-scale military action,"" the agency quoted him as saying.Russia has closer relations with Pyongyang than many other world powers, linked in part to Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and the current leader´s grand-father, having lived for a time in the Soviet Union.Russian President Vladimir Putin has joined other world powers in condemning North Korea´s weapons programme, but has taken a softer line than Western governments. Putin has said that Pyongyang will not be cowed into giving up its weapons programme.He has accused Washington of trying to effect regime change in North Korea, and predicted that would unleash chaos.US Treasury prices surged on the report of a possible new missile test, pulling yields lower, as investors cut risk out of their portfolios and sought the safety of Treasuries."

905,"KARACHI: The ongoing hunt for the knife attack suspect, who has so far injured 15 women within the past two weeks in the city, has been handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), police sources said on Saturday.Even after a fresh spate of knife attacks on women, concentrated mainly in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and Gulshan-e-Iqbal areas, the attacker remains at large, evading arrest and baffling authorities.In the latest approach to the case, police have handed over the hunt to CTD officials who have deployed a case team to work on ways to capture the suspect, sources said. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Friday claimed that the suspect had been identified and was believed to be the same person who was behind similar attacks in Punjab’s Chichawatni area, where 50 women were injured in knife attacks over three years since 2013.Meanwhile, police claimed to have been taking measures to catch the accused through geo-fencing and probing the suspects who have been arrested so far.According to DIG East, police have declared 15 of the suspects detained during raids in different parts of the city as ‘suspicious’; however, no useful information has been obtained from the suspects which could help in nabbing the culprit. On Friday, a woman spotted a ‘suspicious-looking’ man near Maskan Chowrangi and called police to the site, who searched the man but to no avail.Attacks in Punjab's Chichawatni area started in 2013, left 50 women injured The same day, police arrested a ‘suspicious’ man from a mobile market near Jauhar Mor.The incidents have left citizens questioning their safety and the law-enforcement agencies are perturbed whether the attacks are being carried out by an individual or a group.In an attempt to protect those within their precinct, the administration of University of Karachi — situated in the area in question — has banned motorcyclists from wearing a helmet.Some similarities have been noticed in all the incidents: the attacker reportedly attacks with his left hand using a sharp object, wears a helmet and rides a red motorcycle."
906,"The Trump administration has said it believes the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) passes through disputed territory — an allegation originally levelled by India to thwart the multibillion-dollar project.The $56 billion CPEC passes through Pakistan’s northern areas, which India claims is part of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir territory. “The One Belt, One Road also goes through the disputed territory, and I think that in itself shows the vulnerability of trying to establish that sort of a dictate,” US Defence Secretary James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this week, when he and Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford appeared before the Senate and House armed services panel to brief US lawmakers on the current situation in the Pak-Afghan region.The US defence chief added that common grounds should be found with China to thwart terrorism.“As far as Afghanistan goes, as we try to separate out variables where, in some areas, we work with China, for example, terrorism — I think there are areas where we can work — find common ground with China when it comes to counterterrorism, and we should exercise those areas pretty fully,” Mattis said. The United States’ stance on CPEC could further strain relations between Pakistan and the US, especially after US President Donald Trump accused Pakistan of providing ‘safe harbour’ to terrorists in his August speech. Chairman of Parliamentary Committee on CPEC, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed hit back at the United States on its “disputed territory” comments on Saturday.“US’ stance on One Belt, One Road does not have facts, it has contradictions,” he said, referring to US Defence Secretary James Mattis’ remarks that the “CPEC passes through disputed territory”. Senator Mushahid Hussain said the opposition to One Belt, One Road is a “historic mistake” of the American establishment.He also pointed out that the US had supported the project at a forum in Beijing earlier this year. The Trump administration’s own people are furthering trade ties with China, he added. "

911,"GENEVA/YANGON: The United Nations braced on Friday for a possible “further exodus” of Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar into Bangladesh six weeks after the world’s fastest-developing refugee emergency began, UN humanitarian aid chief said.Some 515,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh from Myanmar’s western state of Rakhine in an unrelenting movement of people that began after Myanmar security forces responded to Rohingya militant attacks with a brutal crackdown.The United Nations has denounced the Myanmar military offensive as ethnic cleansing but Myanmar insists its forces are fighting “terrorists” who have killed civilians and burnt villages.Rights groups say more than half of more than 400 Rohingya villages in the north of Rakhine state have been torched in a campaign by the security forces and Buddhist vigilantes to drive out Muslims.Mark Lowcock, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, reiterated an appeal for access to the population in northern Rakhine, saying the situation was “unacceptable”.Buddhist-majority Myanmar has blocked most access to the area, although some agencies have offices open in towns there and the International Committee of the Red Cross is helping the Myanmar Red Cross to deliver aid.“This flow of people of Myanmar hasn’t stopped yet. Obviously there’s into the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya still in Myanmar, and we want to be ready in case there is a further exodus,” Lowcock told a news briefing in Geneva.Lowcock said a senior UN official was expected to visit Myanmar in the next few days.An estimated 2,000 Rohingya are arriving in Bangladesh every day, Joel Millman of the International Organisation for Migration, told a separate briefing.Myanmar officials have said they attempted to reassure groups trying to flee to Bangladesh but could not stop people who were not citizens from leaving.The official Myanmar News Agency said on Friday “large numbers” of Muslims were preparing to cross the border. It cited their reasons as “livelihood difficulties”, health problems, a “belief” of insecurity and fear of becoming a minority.Aid agencies have warned of a malnutrition crisis with about 281,000 people in Bangladesh in urgent need of food, including 145,000 children under five and more than 50,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women.Cholera is a risk, amid fears of disease spreading in the rain-drenched camps where aid workers are trying to install sanitation systems, a spokesman for the World Health Organization said.About 900,000 doses of cholera vaccine are due to arrive this weekend and a vaccination campaign should start on Tuesday.UN-led aid bodies have appealed for $434 million over six months to help up to 1.2 million people - including 300,000 Rohingya already in Bangladesh before the latest crisis and 300,000 Bangladeshi villagers in so-called host communities.The Rohingya are regarded as illegal immigrants in Myanmar and most are stateless.Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has faced criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although a military-drafted constitution gives her no power over the security forces.She has condemned rights abuses and said Myanmar was ready to start a process agreed with Bangladesh in 1993 by which anyone verified as a refugee would be accepted back.Lowcock said talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh on a repatriation plan were a useful first step.“But there is clearly a long way to go,” he said.Both the United States and Britain have warned Myanmar the crisis is putting at risk the progress it has made since the military began to loosen its grip on power.China, which built close ties with Myanmar while it was under military rule and Western sanctions, has been supportive.In Washington, US officials said sanctions and the withholding of aid were among the options available to press Myanmar to halt the violence but they had to be careful to avoid worsening the crisis.“We don’t want to take actions that exacerbate their suffering. There is that risk in this complicated environment,” Patrick Murphy, a deputy assistant secretary of state, told a hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee.Murphy said efforts were under way to identify those responsible for rights violations."
912,"BOGOTA: At least six farmers protesting the removal of coca crops, the base ingredient in cocaine, were killed during a confrontation in rural southwestern Colombia, President Juan Manuel Santos said on Friday.Santos ordered further investigation into the event, which took place on Thursday and also injured 19 people. The incident occurred in Narino province, near Tumaco, a key zone for coca growing.Reports on how exactly the six people died were contradictory.The defense ministry said on Thursday that a dissident group of ex-fighters from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group forced farmers to protest against police who were removing coca crops. The dissidents then fired on the officers and launched home-made missiles, hitting the farmers, the ministry said.But regional farmers’ organizations accused the police and army of firing at the civilians to break up the protest and clear the way for the manual eradication of the crops.The majority of FARC fighters demobilized under a peace deal signed last year, but some dissident units remain involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining. The FARC, now a political party, has distanced itself from the dissidents.“We are verifying the exact way in which things occurred,” Santos said during a press conference. “We are investigating, I don’t want to tie myself to any version of events until these investigations give us total clarity about what happened.”The events underlined the significant challenge that the drug trade represents to the peace process with the FARC, the head of the United Nations’ mission in Colombia said.“The events reinforce our conviction at the United Nations of the necessity of giving coca farmers in affected regions all the means to escape the terrible choice between extreme poverty and illegality,” mission chief Jean Arnault told journalists.Subsistence farmers have often been obliged by rebel groups, paramilitaries and crime gangs to plant and harvest coca. Some also choose to grow the crop because illegal groups will pay more for it than farmers can earn at market with other products - a tempting possibility amid dire poverty.Coca cultivation reached levels not seen for a decade last year after the government banned aerial fumigation with glyphosate, an herbicide that has been linked to cancer. The prohibition has sparked criticism from the United States, which is set to give the Andean country more than $400 million in funding help for the FARC deal.Coca is cultivated on about 188,000 hectares (464,000 acres) across Colombia. The government wants to manually eradicate 100,000 hectares this year."

He also explained that the efforts of those players who do not get a chance to play after selection in the squad would not be wasted in future.Inzamam mentioned that a player, once selected, learns a lot through locker room talks and getting trained by senior coaches.Speaking about the controversial T10 league, he said he had participated in the launching ceremony of T10 league with the permission of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).Inzamam also disclosed that the T10 league would be played under the International Cricket Council's (ICC) supervision; therefore he hoped that there would be no controversy. The famed sportsman was also part of the disputed Indian Cricket League (ICL) — a private cricket club funded by the entertainment industry back in 2008."

916,"PARIS: Around 90 percent of the world´s nuclear weapons are held by the United States and Russia, with the remainder in the hands of another seven countries including North Korea who form a small global nuclear club.ICAN, the International Coalition to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for its decade-long campaign to ban the estimated 15,000 atomic weapons around the world.Around 4,000 are currently deployed and ready to be used, according to figures from the Federation of American Scientists.The United States is the only country that has ever used a nuclear weapon, on August 6 and 9, 1945, on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where some 140,000 and 70,000 people died respectively.Since 1970, when the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) entered into force, five declared nuclear powers -- the US, Russia, France, Britain and China -- agreed not to sell or transfer their weapons technology to other countries.Other signatories of the treaty -- there are 191 in total -- also agreed not to pursue a nuclear weapons programme.Some countries abandoned their nuclear ambitions at around the time of the treaty, including Sweden (1968) and Switzerland (1969), while others have since dropped their programmes such as South Africa (1991) and ex-Soviet republics.Despite the NPT, four other countries managed to develop their own nuclear capability: India, Pakistan and Israel, which never signed the treaty, and most recently North Korea, which pulled out of the treaty in 2003.Iran was suspected of trying to develop its own nuclear weapons capability over the last two decades, which top Nobel world powers feared would lead to an atomic arms race in the Middle East.In 2015, Tehran signed a deal agreeing to inspections and promising that it would use nuclear technology only for energy or other civilian purposes in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions.US President Donald Trump is set to decide by October 15 whether to stick with the deal, which his Western allies insist is the only way of containing the threat. He once called it ""the worst deal ever""."

918,"DUBAI: Opener Dimuth Karunaratne compiled a brilliant century to put Sri Lanka in a commanding position at 254-3 on the opening day of the second day-night Test in Dubai on Friday.The left-hander was unbeaten on 133, adding 118 for an unbroken fourth-wicket stand with skipper Dinesh Chandimal (49 not out) after Sri Lanka won the toss and batted on a flat Dubai Stadium pitch.Karunaratne batted with authority and style to reach his seventh Test hundred off 197 balls, hitting Mohammad Amir for two consecutive boundaries to complete three figures.He batted for 381 minutes, hitting 15 boundaries and a six.Karunaratne fell seven runs short of a hundred in the first Test in Abu Dhabi where Sri Lanka won by 21 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.Chandimal followed his 155 not out in the opening Test with another confident innings, collecting five boundaries as the Sri Lankan pair blunted Pakistan´s bowling attack.Pakistan took the second new ball after 82 overs but failed to claim any further wickets, with Amir walking off in the middle of his 17th over with an apparent injury.Pakistan, who have never lost a Test series in the United Arab Emirates, also wasted both their reviews off the second new ball to cap a woeful day for them.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah was the pick of bowlers with 2-90 while Amir returned figures of 1-59.Karunaratne and opening partner Kaushal Silva (27) provided a solid platform for Sri Lanka with a 63-run stand before Pakistan hit back with three wickets in quick succession.Shah delivered the much-needed breakthrough for his team when he had Silva caught behind off a short delivery.Debutant Sadeera Samarawickrama impressed during his quick-fire 38, smacking five boundaries and a six before he miscued a pull and was caught and bowled by Amir.Kusal Mendis played a rash drive off Shah and was caught in the slips for one.Karunaratne crunched three boundaries in an Amir over and then hit Shah for another to reach his sixth Test fifty.Earlier, Sri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat in the day-night Test against Pakistan in Dubai on Friday. Dinesh Chandimal's team will look to become the first to win a Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, whereas for Pakistan, it is a must-win encounter to save the series. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, 39, was the catalyst for a 21-run victory in the first Test in Abu Dhabi on Monday, as he took 6-43 to foil Pakistan´s modest chase of 136.The narrow win gives Sri Lanka a unique chance for a series win over Pakistan at their neutral venues of the UAE, where they have never lost a series in nine attempts.They have won five and drawn four in the UAE since the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan team bus forced them to play home matches outside of Pakistan.Sri Lankan skipper Chandimal said Pakistani batsmen struggle against Herath.""Normally the Pakistan batters really struggle against the left-arm spinners. We all know Rangana is a legend so I am sure he will be a really good asset for this game as well,"" said Chandimal of his match-winner, who took his 400th Test wicket in Abu Dhabi.Herath also reached 100 wickets against Pakistan during the first Test, but Chandimal warned that the Sri Lankan´s opponents should not be taken lightly.""We never underestimate Pakistan, they are a really good side, especially in the last couple of series they have played really good cricket,"" said Chandimal, whose team will replace Pakistan at sixth in the world rankings with a series win.Chandimal anchored the batting with a polished 155 not out in Sri Lanka´s first-innings total of 419, ably filling in for the more experienced Angelo Mathews, who didn´t travel with the squad due to a calf injury.They are without senior batsman Lahiru Thirimanne, who is suffering from a back problem and has been replaced by the uncapped Sadeera Samarawickrama.We should have won the match in Abu Dhabi but we didn't achieve the target, says captainPakistan are without seamer Hasan Ali, who has a side strain and has been replaced by left-arm fast bowler Wahab Riaz.Captain Sarfraz Ahmed hopes Pakistan move on from the defeat in his first Test as captain.""Credit must be given to Herath the way he bowled,"" said Sarfraz. ""We have never lost in UAE so it´s also important to keep that record intact, so for that we need to attack Herath and play with a positive mindset.""Pakistan will also hope spearhead Mohammad Amir returns to form with the pink ball after going wicketless in the first Test.Debutant Haris Sohail provided a positive in the batting after scores of 76 and 34, while Azhar Ali hit 85.The match is the sixth day-night Test after the first between Australia and New Zealand at Adelaide in 2015.Pakistan beat the West Indies in their first day-night Test at the same venue last year, but this will be Sri Lanka´s maiden pink-ball Test.Umpires: Nigel Llong (ENG) and Richard Kettleborough (ENG)Tv umpire: Sundaram Ravi (IND)ICC match referee: Andy Pycoft (ZIM)"

920,"PESHAWAR: The terrorists of Daesh imprisoned in jails of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were funded from the banned outfit’s budget, while the ones belonging to impoverished backgrounds are also helped financially, sources said. Police told Geo News the information was stated on documents found during an operation on Dalazak Road in Peshawar in June. According to sources, the banned outfit also receives money from people belonging to a certain school of thought in Peshawar. Not only are the terrorists funded but their families are also taken care of, sources said, adding those of the deceased were sent meat this Eid-ul-Azha, sources said. A target killer arrested during the Dalazak Road raid told the police some of the killed terrorists of Daesh were associated with the honey business as they would give a bottle of honey along with a gun to target killers. Their facilitator had rented the mill for them to make explosive material The Dalazak Road raid was carried out at a flour mill in the area, during which at least two terrorists were killed. Five security officers were also injured when an exchange of fire took place between the police and terrorists, Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Tahir Khan had said while talking to the media.The terrorists' den in the flour mill was discovered during the investigation into the killing of police personnel in Chamkani area of Peshawar on June 15. Unknown motorcyclists had opened fire on a police vehicle in the area, killing three policemen and injuring one."
921,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Friday claimed that the knife attack suspect has been identified and is suspected to be the same person who was behind similar attacks in Punjab’s Chichawatni area.Similar attacks started taking place in Chichawatni in 2013, he said. The attacks went on for three years, until 2016 during, during which 50 women were injured, Sindh CM added.  However, even after injuring 15 women in over 11 days the attacker has remained at large. The police claimed to have been taking measures to catch the accused through geo-fencing and probing the suspects who have been arrested so far.A fresh wave of knife attacks left five women injured within a span of three hours in different parts of Karachi on WednesdayOn the other hand, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan has protested the series of similar attacks against women and girls. The party members registered their protest in the National Assembly by walking out of the hall.But the incidents have left citizens with a question over their safety and the law-enforcement agencies are perturbed whether the attacks are being carried out by an individual or a group.While the police have barely moved closer to arresting the accused, other authorities have also not taken useful measures. In an attempt to protect those within their precinct, the administration of University of Karachi — situated in the area in question — has banned motorcyclists from wearing a helmet. This would be a hassle for students riding into the university as it is mandatory for motorcyclists to wear a helmet elsewhere in the city.Some similarities have also been noticed in all the incidents: the attacker reportedly attacks with his left hand using a sharp object, wears a helmet and rides a red motorcycle.Karachi Police released pictures — screengrabs from the CCTV footage — of the suspect Saturday night, wherein the assailant can be seen riding a motorbike moments before attacking one of the victims.""The suspect appears to be a thin man, aged 20-29,"" DIG East Sultan Khawaja said, adding that ""he appears to be 5 feet, 7-9 inches tall"" and usually rides a red motorcycle.The incidents have sparked fear and panic among the area's residents, forcing women to take extra precautions before going outside.Police officers have advised women to be careful while walking on the streets, said a female student of Karachi University (KU) earlier.“We have been directed to not leave our houses after Maghrib prayers,” explained another student.Female students also said that they are taking all possible precautions, including avoiding walking alone at night and not staying out for too long."
922,"All-rounder Ben Stokes will not travel with the rest of England’s squad for the Ashes, though no final decision has been taken on his participation in the test series in Australia, the England Cricket Board (ECB) said on Friday.The 26-year-old Stokes — England’s vice-captain and one of their most important players — was suspended after he and teammate Alex Hales were arrested following an altercation outside a Bristol nightclub last month and released under investigation.Pace bowler Steven Finn has been added to the Ashes squad and will travel to Australia with the rest of the team on October 28, the ECB said in a statement on its website."
923,"DUBAI: The Pakistan cricket team has added left-arm fast bowler Wahab Riaz in place of seamer Hassan Ali; the leading wicket-taker of the ICC Champions Trophy is rested due to a side strain.Hassan Ali had been troubled with fitness problems since the last month when he also missed the second T20 against World XI team.Pakistan once again chose to retain their main spinner Yasir Shah in the lineup along with three fast bowlers for the second and third Test match of the series against Sri Lanka held in Dubai.The remainder of the side remains unchanged from the first game — that Sri Lankans narrowly won in Abu Dhabi's Sheikh Zayed Stadium.The Sri Lankan team are in high spirits after the first match and have only made two changes for the second Test.Debutants Sadeera Samarawickrama and Lahiru Gamage come in to the side as replacements for injured batsman Lahiru Thirimanne and spinner Lakshan Sandakan, respectively.Samarawickrama received his Test cap from batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne, whereas Gamage earned his from bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake.It appears that Sri Lankans are looking to strengthen their seam attack, as they included the right-arm, fast-medium Gamage in place of Sandakan — who stayed wicketless in the first Test.Speaking about the behaviour of the pitch, skipper Dinesh Chandimal indicated a day prior to the Test that the track in Dubai could be helpful and supportive to the seamers.This is the sixth day/night Test match following International Cricket Council’s (ICC) approval in a bid to improve the popularity of the longest form cricket.The Test that has commenced in Dubai International Cricket Stadium, is Sri Lanka’s maiden pink-ball game. while Pakistan is playing their third day/night Test.Interestingly, Pakistan played their first pink-ball Test against West Indies in Dubai, wherein Azhar Ali opened the innings and made an undefeated masterful triple century at 302 runs, declaring at 579/3.Unfortunately, they were miserly bundled out for 123 runs in the second innings.West Indies right-arm leg break bowler Devendra Bishoo thrashed Pakistan’s experienced batting line-up and took eight wickets.Pakistan will now have to face Rangana Herath — another master of spin, who has already steered his team to clinch a victory in Abu Dhabi with his terrific bowling.The Pakistani skipper Sarfraz Ahmed showed his confidence in the batting line-up and expressed hope that Pakistani batsmen will attack Sri Lankan bowlers.Babar Azam, the middle-order batsman who received his Test cap at the Dubai cricket stadium last year in the Day and Night Test, was unfortunately exposed by Sri Lankan seamers and spinners in both innings of the Abu Dhabi Test.Nevertheless, he has been given a chance to prove his skills in the Test format again."
924,"Spain sealed their place in next year's World Cup by routing Albania 3-0 on Friday in a match laced with political tension amidst Catalonia's drive for independence and blighted by more jeers for Gerard Pique.Pique made his 92nd appearance at international level just days after voting in a referendum on Catalan independence deemed illegal by the Spanish government and marred by a police crackdown that left hundreds needing medical attention.However, the outspoken Barcelona defender and his teammates put the distractions of a turbulent week behind them to continue their sensational form since Julien Lopetegui took charge thanks to goals from Rodrigo, Isco and Thiago Alcantara.""I think it is time to start focusing on positive news in football and in the country because there are very good things"", said Lopetegui.""I think sport and the behaviour of the boys this week leads the way to show what we are and what we can be as a team. Sport is a good example.""Victory opened up a five-point gap on Italy atop Group G of European qualifying with just one qualifier remaining after the Azzurri were held 1-1 at home by Macedonia.""We did our bit which was to win the game and the Italy result qualifies us mathematically,"" added Lopetegui.""The best (part of qualifying) has been the commitment, enthusiasm, desire, humility and passion of the players since I arrived.""As has been common for the last two years when representing Spain, Pique was met with a mixture of jeers and applause as many have taken as much offence at his outspoken jibes at rivals Real Madrid as his political stance.Along with captain Sergio Ramos and Barca teammate Andres Iniesta, Pique has called for politicians on both sides of the political divide to negotiate in order to avoid the shocking scenes of violence that reverberated around the world last weekend.""To me Gerard is calm, the relationship between him and the rest is one of respect,"" said Rodrigo.""He is a very important player for this national team.""However, some fans were less forgiving of Pique's decision to continue criticising the heavy-handed policing after joining up with the Spain squad this week on social media.""In Las Rozas (Spain's training ground) you no longer wear the Barca shirt, but that of the national team, of the country you belong to and you retweet things against that country,"" said Nacho Ortiz, 23, draped in a Spanish flag outside the ground who admitted he would jeer Pique before the game.""It is a painful subject,"" said Ortiz's friend Adrian Pena.Pique has campaigned for Catalonia's right to self-determination but has never publicly backed independence for the wealthy northeastern region of Spain.""My personal opinion is that Pique hasn't said he is in favour of independence. He has asked for dialogue, that there is a binding referendum,"" said Sofia Duperiel, an Alicante native who came to watch the game with her six-year-old son.A 25,000 strong crowd at the Estadio Jose Rico Perez in Alicante were soon rejoicing in cries of ""I am Spanish"" and ""Viva Espana"" (long live Spain) as the hosts raced into a 3-0 lead inside 27 minutes.Valencia striker Rodrigo opened the scoring by firing a rising drive into the top corner from Isco's fine through ball.Isco then found the net himself by smashing high past Etrit Berisha before Thiago powered home a header from another debutant Alvaro Odriozola's pinpoint cross to round off a stunning three-goal blast in 11 minutes.Pique continued to attract attention after the break as he firstly picked up a yellow card that will see him miss Spain's final qualifier against Israel on Monday through suspension.And he then applauded the crowd as he was replaced by Nacho to a combination of whistles from some and a standing ovation from others.""For sure it spoils the party,"" added Duperiel. ""It is a shame to mix politics and sport."""
925,"Rafael Nadal sent an ominous warning of intent as the 16-time Grand Slam winner bulldozed his way into the quarter-finals of the China Open on Thursday.The Spanish world number one, enjoying a late-career flourish, dispatched Russia's promising Karen Khachanov 6-3, 6-3 on the outside hard court in Beijing.Nadal, the top seed and coming off the back of a third US Open title, faces big-serving American John Isner in the last eight.The 31-year-old Nadal broke Khachanov, ranked 42 in the world, in the fourth game and was never in serious trouble after that.Khachanov, at age 21 a rising talent, simply had no reply to Nadal's explosive forehand and made too many routine errors.Nadal broke the young Russian again in the third game of the second set as he cruised into the last eight.It was a contrast to his opener in the Chinese capital, when Nadal saved two match points against Frenchman Lucas Pouille."

927,"Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) — whose names appeared in a memo allegedly published by Pakistan's civilian intelligence agency — met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Friday to discuss the ongoing ""fake letter"" fiasco, sources disclosed.The MNAs made their reservations clear to Abbasi, saying that having their names appear on the alleged list — which links them to outlawed terrorist outfits — has tarnished their image, the sources added.There is a possibility the opposition may use this opportunity to create an issue against them or frame them, the MNAs identified in the alleged list lamented.Nevertheless, the Premier assured to resolve the concerned MNAs' reservations.Sources mentioned that Aftab Sultan — the Director-General of the Intelligence Bureau (IB) — as well as Minister of Interior Ahsan Iqbal, Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq, and Minister of Law Zahid Hamid were part of the unverified meeting on Friday.Sultan disassociated himself from the report that surfaced publicly on September 28, that ties the names of certain MNAs to banned terrorist groups, and that the spy agency has denied authoring.The list in question is ""fake"", he stressed.The top intelligence officer, however, briefed the participants of the meeting regarding an investigation launched to probe into the alleged letter, sources mentioned.The MNAs, on the other hand, demanded the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Interior submit an explanatory response letter.In a statement issued following the reports, the Prime Minister House commented that it was not aware of any meeting held between Abbasi and the MNAs over the alleged IB letter.Riaz Hussain Pirzada — the Minister of Inter-Provincial Coordination — was the first one to raise this issue at an Abbasi-chaired cabinet meetingIB memo stated Nawaz directed the authority to monitor activities of 37 legislatorsShown on a private TV channel late last month, the memo stated that ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif had directed IB to monitor 37 legislators' activities due to their reported links with banned terrorist and sectarian groups.The list in question named a number of key ministers — including Pirzada, Hamid, Baleeghur Rehman, Sikandar Bosan, Hafiz Abdul Kareem, and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly Murtaza Javed Abbasi — as having ties with proscribed outfits.Separately, the federal government took notice of this ""fake"" IB memo, sources informed Geo News, adding that it promised to file a case — following a thorough investigation — in Islamabad's Secretariat police station against those involved in drafting the memo and leaking it to the media.Pirzada, alongside a few other legislators, staged on October 5 a walkout from the National Assembly.The memo claimed links between parliamentarians including Riaz Pirzada and proscribed organizationIn his speech, Pirzada underscored that he belongs to a respectable family. ""The Prime Minister House should have immediately ordered an inquiry after receiving the report. If I am a terrorist, why I am a minister?""The minister had clarification as to whether such an inquiry was initiated by the PM House or not.Interrupting Pirzada's speech to make a response, Sadiq told him that IB had filed a complaint to Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) while he was on a visit to Iraq.“Come to my chamber tomorrow. I will call DG IB. This is a sub-judice matter,” the speaker directed Pirzada.The government also advised PEMRA to take strict action against apparently mala fide reporting.The IB has also issued a formal denial of any such report or list.“Intelligence Bureau, premier national intelligence agency, is fully committed to safeguarding national interest and security of the country. Its officers/officials are working round the clock throughout the length and breadth of the country, facing all kinds of risks emerging in the line of duty,” a senior IB official said on September 27 during a TV program.The spy agency said it prepared no such report and, thus, the story was false, baseless, and unfounded."
928,"Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker was “deep in production hell”, just days after the company said it would fall behind its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 sedan due to production bottlenecks.Tesla has been struggling to meet delivery deadlines on Model 3 and in the most recent quarter missed its initial production target.Shares of the company showed little reaction to Musk’s replies to Twiteratti, complaining about the company’s production delays.In response to a Tesla customer asking if he would get his car delivered this year, Musk tweeted, “December will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now.”The Palo Alto, California-based company delivered just 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in the third quarter.A Wall Street Journal report said parts of Model 3 were being made by hand as recently as early September, adding to production delays.Musk also said Tesla would reschedule the unveiling of its semi-truck to Nov. 16 as it focuses on fixing production issues tied to Model 3 and increases battery production for Puerto Rico.The unveiling of the truck, called Tesla Semi, has been delayed for the second time this year. Musk had initially said the truck would be unveiled in September, but he later rescheduled it to late October.“Semi specs are better than anything I’ve seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now,” Elon replied to a twitter user who asked him about the specifications of the semi-truck.Earlier in the day, Musk said the company will send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out power on the island over two weeks ago."

930,"NEW YORK: Boeing is beefing up its investments in autonomous and electric hybrid planes in anticipation that aviation could be primed for as much disruption as virtually every other sector.The aerospace giant has announced a series of recent tech-focused investments, unveiling plans Thursday to acquire autonomous aviation company Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation, as well as a stake in Zunum Aero, which works on hybrid electric planes.Many of the technologies -- such as unmanned flying taxis -- sound space age, but the latest deals are a sign they may not be as far off as they seem. Boeing did not disclose financial terms for either investment.""The aerospace industry is going to be changing,"" Boeing chief technology officer Greg Hyslop said in a conference call with journalists.The Aurora purchase builds on Boeing´s work with the company on commercial and military equipment. Today´s commercial airplanes already employ sophisticated computer systems that have automated key aspects of flying.But Aurora aims to go far beyond that, aspiring to a completely autonomous flight, from take-off to landing. A robot, with the aid of artificial intelligence, could back up a pilot by depressing the pedals, taking control in emergency situations or even landing the plane.In May, Aurora, collaborating with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, successfully tested its automated co-pilot system on a Boeing commercial plane.Aurora has also worked to develop a kind of flying taxi system, of keen interest to Boeing in its ongoing rivalry with Airbus.In April, Aurora was selected by Uber to develop its on-demand urban air transportation system. Aurora´s goal of delivering 50 autonomous aircraft for testing by 2020 is ""well within reach,"" the company said at the time.Airbus for its part is working to develop its flying taxi system Vahana by the end of the year, as well as another concept, Pop UP, that could travel between cities.Boeing also is seeking greater exposure to electric hybrid aircraft, a pursuit of Aurora and also of Zunum Aero, a Seattle startup in which Boeing has a stake.Zunum Aero said Thursday it expects to be able to deliver hybrid electric planes for delivery in 2022.The plane aims to address a gap in regional travel of up to 1,000 miles, a segment for which there are few options, high costs and ""door-to-door travel times haven´t improved in decades,"" Zunum Aero said in a news release.The technology could let planes skip big regional airports such as Washington and Boston and instead travel from Beverly, Massachusetts to College Park, Maryland at a lower fare.The company expects to begin test flights in 2019. Zunum Aero has hired technologists who have worked on leading-edge vehicles for Boeing and Rolls-Royce.""This aircraft is going to transform how we live and work,"" said founder and Aero chief engineer Matt Knapp. ""We´ve pushed ourselves to challenge conventional wisdom and the limits of engineering to deliver an aircraft of which we are extremely proud -- one that offers efficiency and performance without compromise."""

932,"MOSCOW: The Kremlin on Friday criticised ""unprecedented pressure"" on Russian media in the United States and warned of possible reciprocal action.The US Department of Justice has ordered the state-funded RT media group, a television channel which broadcasts in English and other languages, to register as a ""foreign agent"" under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).The television network is increasingly viewed in Washington as a Kremlin propaganda tool used to interfere in the 2016 US presidential polls.According to RT, the channel has been given a deadline of October 17 to register under FARA, a law written in 1938 to blunt Nazi propaganda, which specifically exempts news organisations.Foreign agent status could mean that the channel would have to make personal information about its employees and interviewees public, RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan said Thursday.""If we don't... our employees and property will be arrested,"" she said, calling it ""de-facto expulsion from the country.""State news agency Sputnik, which has the same management as RT, is also under FBI investigation, according to reports.""Some of our media is faced with unprecedented pressure,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.""We believe this is being done in violation of freedom of speech (and) freedom of the media.""""Clearly, in the case of continued pressure, continued violation of the rights of our media to work unimpeded, I cannot rule out that actions will be taken in accordance with the principle of reciprocity.""Russian media reports said prosecutors are considering retaliatory measures against US media.Russia's media watchdog chief on Thursday said it found CNN in violation of the country´s media law over a technicality and issued an official warning.At a Senate committee meeting on defending state sovereignty, Simonyan said: ""People are quitting in droves... it's hard to even find a stringer in the US.""She added that YouTube has kicked the channel off the list of ´Google Preferred´ premium video channels for advertisers.""Clearly this is a result of pressure,"" she said.Senate committee chairman Andrei Klimov said ""it´s time to think about concrete retaliatory measures"" to US actions."
933,"PARIS: New revelations from a probe into ties between Daesh group and Lafarge cast light on why the French cement giant was desperate to stay in Syria and the price it was prepared to pay.To ensure the protection of its staff, Lafarge Cement Syria (LCS) paid between $80,000 and $100,000 a month to various armed groups, including $20,000 to Daesh, according to a source close to the investigation.The funds went through a middleman, Syrian tycoon Firas Tlass, who was a former minority shareholder in the cement works, Bruno Pescheux, who ran the plant from 2008 to 2014, told investigators.Lafarge's bosses in Paris are suspected of having approved payments by LCS through ""false accounting documents"".The year-long investigation has heard witnesses describe cooked books enabling oil purchases from Daesh, a laissez-passer allowing Lafarge trucks to circulate in the region and a planned meeting between IS and the top LCS security official.Lafarge, which merged with the Swiss group Holcim in 2015, admitted it had resorted to ""unacceptable practices"" to keep LCS running in a war zone in 2013-14.Lafarge began operating in the northern Syrian town of Jalabiya in October 2010 at an investment of $680 million - the biggest outside the oil industry.War broke out six months later and the European Union imposed an embargo on Syrian arms and oil.In 2013, Daesh and other armed groups took control of the oil-rich northern region where Lafarge was operating along with French oil giant Total and other multinationals.But while the others pulled out, Lafarge decided to stay.A source close to the probe said the group's former CEO Bruno Lafont told investigators in January that he believed ""things were under control"" and there was no reason to flee the war-torn country.But former officials told investigators that a key reason for staying on was to hold the strategic advantage of being on the ground for Syria´s reconstruction once the war ended.The decision allegedly had the blessing of the French government then led by Socialist president Francois Hollande.""The foreign ministry told us that we should hold on, that things would work out,"" former deputy COO Christian Herrault said. ""We would see the French ambassador to Syria every six months and no one told us 'now you have to leave'.""Daesh issued the laissez-passers for Lafarge trucks in May 2014, according to a source close to the probe.Investigators also suspect LCS of receiving its oil supplies from Daesh under the cover of fake consulting contracts starting in June 2013 at a time when IS controlled most of Syria's strategic reserves.Frederic Jolibois, who ran the plant from July 2014, admitted: ""The Syrian government was not in control of the refineries, so you bought (oil) from non-governmental organisations... completely illegally.""On June 29, 2014, the day Daesh proclaimed its ""caliphate"" straddling Syria and Iraq, it also set up a meeting with the cement plant's security boss, investigators have heard.Senior LCS staff had begun leaving Syria in the summer of 2012, with other Lafarge expatriates leaving in waves starting a few months later.Investigators are examining whether LCS did all it could to ensure the security of its Syrian staff.Jolibois claimed that staying on was a source of pride for the locals, saying: ""For them, it was an act of resistance.""But 11 former employees and the anti-corruption association Sherpa lodged a complaint last year stating that Syrian staff were pressured to stay or risk being sacked or having their pay withheld.They said they had to fend for themselves when Daesh seized control of the cement works in September 2014.Investigators interviewed three former employees in Paris last month.Contacted Friday, Lafarge reiterated that it ""regrets and condemns the unacceptable mistakes committed in Syria."""
934,"LUANDA: In Mabor, a dusty and neglected corner of Luanda, the sound of a catchy beat rising means only one thing to the area´s youngsters: time to dance the kizomba.The Angolan dance is gaining worldwide popularity and has a committed contingent of students in Mabor who are drawn to class by its romantic rhythms.""Stop! Boys stay still, only the girls move now. Like that, that´s good!"" said instructor Vitor Especao, wearing a bright purple shirt as he guided his pupils.The dancers followed his instructions closely, their bodies twisting in ever more suggestive ways, watched intently by a group of mesmerised small children.""It´s what I really like about this dance -- the joy, the enthusiasm and the harmony,"" said Especao.Kizomba´s origins are hotly debated.It has Angolan roots and draws on influences from the Caribbean and Cape Verde, but it was secured in the popular consciousness by singer Eduardo Paim only in the 1990s.Its name means ""party"" in Kimbundu, one of the most widely spoken languages in Angola, and has even helped shape the semba, which is considered to be the nation´s traditional dance.The kizomba´s swaying movements are performed by a couple in a close embrace but at a slower, more sensual pace than the semba.Angolans quickly began taking up the kizomba.""It´s a very calm style, very suave. You don´t move too much and you dance calmly,"" said Elsa Domingos Cardoso, a 22-year-old student.""Whether it´s the kizomba or the samba, dancing brings me joy.""In recent years the kizomba has begun to spread across the dance floors of Europe, before being taken up across the world.""It´s natural that it works everywhere,"" said Mario Contreiras, a keen amateur kizomba dancer.""Everybody needs affection,"" said the Luanda-based architect, who has become something of an ambassador for the dance.""Elsewhere in the world, when they discover a dance which comes from Africa in which people intertwine themselves even if they don´t know each other... that really delights them.""Kizomba has become a fashionable phenomenon. It is already being taught in places as diverse as London, Paris, New York and Johannesburg, with festivals and workshops as far afield as Shanghai, Moscow, Tokyo, Mumbai and Auckland.Angola has been better-known for its bloody civil war, its oil wealth or president Jose Eduardo dos Santos -- who stood down last month after ruling for 38 years.But increasingly it is muscling in on the crowded global dance scene.Local radio host Zelo Castelo Branco was at first proud of the attention that the dance was bringing Angola, but now he claims to no longer recognise the version performed overseas.Exported too widely, the dance is beginning to lose its soul, he said.""Everybody dances the kizomba, that's good. But those who are teaching it abroad are changing the style,"" said Branco.""It's no longer a traditional, family affair that we can dance with our wives and children, our parents... it´s extravagant -- it´s nearly a tarraxinha,"" he said, referring to kizomba´s more adult, percussive cousin which some Angolans refer to as the ""karaxinha"".In largely Christian Angola, the tarraxinha is strictly the preserve of consenting couples.Mateos Vandu Mavila, the leader of a dance troupe that trains in Mabor, refuses to allow his team to perform the tarraxinha when they appear at weddings or festivals.""It all depends on the age of those who are taking part in the celebration. We don´t condone youngsters dancing the tarraxinha... It´s way too sensual,"" he said.Contreiras, the architect, is frustrated by the confusion between the kizomba and the tarraxinha.""People are seeking to link the kizomba with sensuality and a level of eroticism (but) for us it´s something very serious, it´s our form of self-expression, our culture.""Contreiras joined the ""kizomba in the street"" project, initiated in 2012 in a bid to promote the dance and defend it from outside influences.Every Sunday night he transforms Luanda´s sea front into a giant dance floor -- free of charge and open to all.""The goal is to promote the kizomba... to give those who don´t yet know it an opportunity to learn it and to protect Angola´s dance culture,"" said Manuel Miguel, 26, one of the team responsible for the Sunday night spectaculars.""The kizomba is a mirror of who we are and for our culture. Angola is the celebration and the kizomba is Angola."""

""Achakzai has nothing to do with FATA"", he claimed.During the occasion, former district general secretary JUI-F Mufti Sajjad also announced to join PTI.“It is necessary to eliminate the menace of corruption for a strong and prosperous nation,” said Mufti Sajjad.  On October 2, PTI chief, while addressing a press conference in the federal capital on Monday, said he is being compared to the most corrupt man in the country.He further said that propaganda is being created and his case is being portrayed in the same light as that of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.""They think that if Nawaz is a thief, then Imran Khan must be one as well,"" he added.""I am ready for accountability,"" he said, adding that he is submitted his money trail to the Supreme Court.""I have submitted all the documents pertaining to the money I earned abroad for 20 years,"" said the PTI chief.On the other hand, Sharif family have failed to provide any details of their properties. ""Nawaz Sharif's children became millionaires at a young age,"" PTI chief reiterated.Imran alleged that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is protecting the country’s biggest thief. ""They are destroying democracy. They have formed a law to protect a criminal"" he said referring to the Electoral Reforms Bill 2017. "
936,"MADRID: A Spanish government official Friday offered the first apology to Catalans injured by police during their outlawed independence vote as the sides showed tentative signs of seeking an exit from the crisis.In Spain's deepest political crisis in decades, Catalan leaders had threatened to declare independence unilaterally and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy vowed to stop them, rejecting calls for mediation.The worsening standoff raised fears of further unrest in the northeastern region, a tourist-friendly land of 7.5 million people that accounts for a fifth of Spain's economy.But Friday saw the first signs the sides may be willing to step back from the brink in a political conflict that threatens to destabilise Europe.After days of ill-tempered rhetoric, the central government said it regretted last Sunday´s injuries and suggested Catalonia should hold a regional election to settle the crisis.Catalan government minister Santi Vila, a close of ally of regional president Carles Puigdemont, meanwhile told broadcaster Rac1 that his side could consider a ""ceasefire"" in the dispute, to avoid a further crackdown by Madrid.Puigdemont postponed an appearance in the regional parliament at which some leaders were hoping for a declaration of independence, a spokesman said.Spain's central government apologised on behalf of police to people hurt in last Sunday´s referendum disturbances.""I can do nothing but regret it, apologise on behalf of the officers who intervened,"" said the government´s representative in Catalonia, Enric Millo.""I am very sad, very sorry, we deeply regret that we have arrived at this situation, it has been very hard, everything that we have experienced and seen these past few days,"" he said.Central government spokesman Ignacio Mendez de Vigo also said later he ""regretted"" the injuries.""It would be good to start mending this fracture... through regional elections,"" he told a news conference.In Madrid meanwhile, Catalonia's police chief and two prominent separatist leaders avoided being remanded in custody at a court hearing Friday over sedition accusations.The court summons raised tensions, but despite the gravity of the accusations the court did not issue a custodial order that could have further escalated the dispute.Jordi Cuixart and Jordi Sanchez, leaders of Catalonia´s two biggest pro-independence civil groups, and regional police chief Josep Lluis Trapero walked free from the preliminary hearing at the National Court in Madrid.A court official told AFP the judge had ordered no custody or other cautionary measures against them pending an investigation into the accusations.The two civil leaders were accused of sedition for their role in unrest during protests in Barcelona last month.Trapero´s force was accused of failing to rein in the protesters.""We are convinced that sooner rather than later the Spanish state will have to sit down for a dialogue"" with the Catalan regional government, Cuixart said.The government says it will not join in any talks or accept mediation until the Catalans abandon their independence drive.Spain's Constitutional Court on Thursday ordered the suspension of a session scheduled for Monday in the Catalan parliament at which some leaders have called for an independence declaration.If Catalonia declares independence, Spain could respond by suspending the region´s existing autonomous status and imposing direct rule from Madrid.In spite of the government apology on Friday, the government in Madrid pushed ahead with a measure to pressure Catalonia economically.It passed a decree to make it quicker for businesses to shift their legal domiciles away from one region to another.Catalonia's second-biggest bank said Thursday it was shifting its legal headquarters out of the region due to the turbulence.Catalonia's biggest lender CaixaBank was also set to hold discussions on Friday about possibly shifting its legal domicile out of the region, a source close to the matter told AFP.With its own language and cultural traditions, demands for independence in Catalonia date back centuries but have surged during recent years of economic crisis.Barcelona Football Club, a powerful symbol of Catalan identity, and its captain Andres Iniesta called for dialogue to settle the crisis.""Do it for all of us. We deserve to live in peace,"" Iniesta wrote on Facebook.His Spain teammate and Real Madrid rival Sergio Ramos said he hoped the crisis will be ""resolved as soon as possible.""He spoke at a news conference ahead of Friday night´s World Cup qualifier against Albania.But Ramos also said ""hats off"" to Spain´s King Felipe, who angered Catalan leaders by calling them to drop their independence drive."
937,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Friday that even thinking of amending the finality of Prophethood clause is a sin.“Even thinking of amending this law is kufr,” said Iqbal while addressing a press conference. “We are all Muslims. The finality of Prophethood is our part of our faith,” said the interior minister.He also denied allegations that the clause was removed from the newly passed act.However, some people are using this to sow seeds to hatred in the society, said Iqbal.“Pakistan is a diverse country,” he said comparing the country to a bouquet of different flowers. “Our diversity makes us beautiful.”The interior minister also stated that Jihad is the prerogative of the state and no one else.“If we should engage in Jihad or not is the prerogative of the state,” he said while speaking at Press Information Department.He also said: “who is Muslim and who is not a Muslim can't be decided on social media, rather it is state’s prerogative.”If decisions are made on the fatwas issued in streets then it would result in anarchy, he claimed.Earlier in the day, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Jamaat-e-Islami’s Siraj-ul-Haq flanked Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s statement over the clause on the finality of Prophethood in the elections act, saying whichever minister intended to make the amendment should be dismissed from the Cabinet.On October 5, the National Assembly unanimously passed amendments to the Election Bill 2017, restoring Khatm-i-Naboowat (finality of Prophethood) declaration required to be signed by public office holders to its original form.NA unanimously passes amendments to Election Bill 2017 after govt admitted a 'clerical error' in Khatm-i-Naboowat declaration formThe controversy had arisen when the ruling party had passed amendments to the election law earlier this week, with opposition parties claiming the bill moved by the government had also changed the contents of a form regarding belief in Khatm-i-Naboowat (finality of Prophethood), which is required to be signed by public office holders and election candidates.The amendments passed were agreed upon by members of parliamentary parties after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had accepted the government had made a 'clerical error' and invited them to discuss the matter in his chambers. During the meeting, the parliamentary leaders agreed to restore the declaration to the original form it was in before the National Assembly passed the Elections Bill 2017 on Tuesday. "

India was represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini also attended the conference.Despite the fact the EU pays great attention to human rights in all cases, the matter of grave violations by the Indian forces in IoK was not part of the agenda of EU-India Summit.Not a single time EU leaders mentioned right abuses in IoK, where nearly 100,000 Kashmiris have been martyred since the popular uprising against the Indian rule and thousands others have been blinded because of frequent use of pellet-guns by Indian troops.The EU and India have issued a joint statement on combating terrorism, clean energy and climate change, and smart and sustainable urbanisation, according to the statement.

It is natural"", said the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker.""We agreed that we should take our trading relationship to the next level. It is high time for a Free Trade Agreement between India and the EU. Once the circumstances are right – and only once the circumstances are right – we will resume. Today's summit is an important step in the right direction and after hearing Prime Minister Modi, I am confident we can move forward. Our chief negotiators will next sit down in November to chart a way forward.""EU President Donald Tusk on Friday urged Myanmar to adhere to its international rights obligations and allow Rohingya refugees to return after weeks of violence that have forced more than half a million to flee to Bangladesh.Tusk said Myanmar must give aid workers access to the troubled state of Rakhine, where the Rohingya ethnic minority says the military are burning their villages.He made the comments after talks with Indian leaders in New Delhi, which he said was first in line to respond to the refugee crisis as a neighbouring country.""The EU continues to assume its responsibilities by receiving people in need of protection and by assisting host countries close to the conflict zones,"" said Tusk after the talks.""We addressed the situation in Myanmar and the Rohingya refugee crisis. We want to see de-escalation of tension and the full adherence to international human rights obligations as well as full humanitarian access so the aid can reach those in need.""EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the summit had been an ""important step in the right direction"" towards an agreement, but gave no time frame for progress.The EU is India's largest trading partner, accounting for more than 13 percent of the country's commerce."

However, it’s dependence on the university will give university administration the right to decide who will be given treatment.”Another protester shared that the university wants to minimise its staff and keep least number of people around. Many will lose their jobs as a result of this, he added.“We have approached the government over the issue and protested.

943,"LONDON: Two unverified and completely baseless news stories were spread through Whatsapp groups, social media and a private news channel to target former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.For about a week, a post was run through social media by an individual called ‘Ashoor Baba’ in which it was alleged that Nawaz Sharif held a “secret meeting” at Hasan Nawaz Sharif’s flat with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s London-based exiled leader Altaf Hussain. In another news – run through Whatsapp groups and social media forums, which claimed that Nawaz had hired an American public relations and lobbying firm to stage his comeback to power.The first post started circulating after Nawaz reached London in the last week of August to be with his wife Begum Kulsoom Nawaz, who is undergoing treatment for throat cancer. There were feverish speculations about who Nawaz was meeting and whether he will go back to Pakistan or not.The social media post alleged that a senior diplomat of the Indian High Commission also played a role in facilitating this meeting.The fake news then made to several TV channels, where anchors and guests presented the fake post as a fact that Nawaz Sharif had met Altaf Hussain at his son’s flat.Three days ago, Awami Muslim League leader Sheikh Rasheed went a step ahead and relied on the fake post in his address at the National Assembly and claimed that the MQM leader had met Nawaz at Hasan Nawaz’s office. A private Pakistani TV channel aired in the UK first claimed that it had been told by “sources” that Nawaz had met Hussain. A channel insider claimed that its reporter, who was stationed outside Hasan Nawaz’s house, saw many people coming with bouquets for Begum Kulsoom Nawaz who had returned home after being at the hospital for treatment.Many individuals and political parties sent flowers to Kulsoom Nawaz which also included an activist of MQM who came to drop flowers at the reception of the residence. The bouquets were received by the porter and not by any member of the Sharif family. Separately, another news was circulated through social media that Nawaz Sharif had hired a PR firm to lobby for him and this was discussed on various talk shows. A PMLN source in the UK said that Nawaz didn’t meet Hussain“It's to the credit of Nawaz Sharif that he launched successful operations against militancy in Karachi and under him, peace returned to Karachi. He stood by the people of Karachi when they faced worst kind of lawlessness. Baseless news is being spread by desperate minds who believe in petty politics and their own lies are exposed when they have no proofs to back up their lies,"" said the PML-N sourceThe PMLN source said that it’s laughable that Nawaz Sharif will hire a lobbying firm for his case. “People of Pakistan are the biggest lobbyists of Nawaz Sharif who have time and again reposed their trust in him despite all the conspiracies against him, which continue till today. The people of Pakistan stand by Nawaz Sharif and know it well that he has been ousted to damage Pakistan,” said the PMLN leader."

945,"LAHORE: Unidentified persons threw acid on a family in transit in a car in Jubilee Town of the city on Friday. According to the police, a woman, her 12-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son were in transit when they were thrown acid at. Subsequently, the survivors were shifted to the hospital, while the attackers escaped the site. The woman has accused her former husband of the attack, saying he got someone to do so over property dispute. The affected woman has requested filing of FIR in Chohang police station while Punjab IG Captain (retd) Arif Nawaz has taken notice of the matter ordering the capital city police officer for a report on the case. As per Punjab Commission on the Status of Women (PCSW), the main cause of acid attacks taking place unabashedly is the absence of proper legislation on acid crimes. Moreover, there is no law to regulate the manufacturing and supply of acids and therefore anyone has easy access to them, states the website of PCSW. The Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Act, 2011 (Criminal Law Second Amendment Act, 2011) made amendments in Pakistan Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code to punish perpetrators of acid crimes by clearly including acid crimes in the definition of hurt. The definition now includes “hurt by dangerous means or substance, including any corrosive substance or acid to be crimes”, the website reads. "

Now there are more phones on the market.”The Pixel phones lack the brand lustre and market share of similarly priced smartphonesThe headphone jack is a single purpose port and it takes a lot of space on a smartphone, according to the company. The move was “absolutely” a driving factor in the company’s decisions to launch its own AirPod competitor, the Pixel Buds, according to Queiroz. On October 5, Google on unveiled the second generation of its Pixel smartphone along with new voice-enabled home speakers, redoubling its commitment to the hardware business as it competes with a surge of devices from Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc.Google’s new products, including a Pixelbook laptop, wireless earbuds and a small GoPro-like camera, showcase Google-developed operating systems and services, notably the voice assistant. That means usage of those devices should stoke the company’s core ad sales business as buyers of the hardware using Google services like search and maps.Speaking at the launch in San Francisco, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said the new products “perfectly demonstrate our strategy of re-imagining hardware from the inside out.”"

952,"TOKYO: Japan's public broadcaster apologised Friday to the parents of a young reporter who died of heart failure after logging 159 hours of overtime in a month.NHK reporter Miwa Sado, 31, who had been covering political news in Tokyo, was found dead in her bed in July 2013, reportedly clutching her mobile phone.""The president met the parents at their home in the morning and apologised,"" an NHK spokesman told AFP.A government inquest a year after her death ruled that it was linked to excessive overtime. She had taken two days off in the month before she died.NHK eventually made the case public four years later, bowing to pressure from Sado´s parents to take action to prevent a recurrence.The case has again highlighted the Japanese problem of ""karoshi"" - meaning death from overwork - and is an embarrassing revelation for NHK, which has campaigned against the nation's long-hours culture.Sato covered Tokyo assembly elections for the broadcaster in June 2013 and an upper-house vote for the national parliament the following month.She died three days after the upper-house election.""My heart breaks at the thought that she may have wanted to call me"" in her last moments, her mother told the Asahi daily.""With Miwa gone, I feel like half of my body has been torn off. I won't be able to laugh for real for the rest of my life.""The revelation shocked the nation as NHK has actively reported tragic deaths at other companies, including the 2015 suicide of a young woman at major advertising agency Dentsu who logged more than 100 hours of overtime in one month.A Tokyo court on Friday ordered Dentsu to pay 500,000 yen as a penalty for allowing its employees, including the young woman, to illegally work excessive overtime hours.NHK's chief has pledged to improve work conditions at the broadcaster.""We are sorry that we lost an excellent reporter and take seriously the fact that her death was recognised as work-related,"" president Ryoichi Ueda said Thursday.""We will continue to work for reform in cooperation with her parents,"" he told reporters.Labour minister Katsunobu Kato on Friday urged the public broadcaster to reduce long working hours.""We urge NHK to manage work hours and cut long working hours... so that such incidents will never happen,"" Kato told reporters, according to the Asahi Shimbun.Every year in Japan, long working hours are blamed for dozens of deaths due to strokes, heart attacks and suicides.In July, the parents of an unnamed 23-year-old worker on Tokyo's Olympic stadium who killed himself applied for compensation and asked the government to recognise his suicide as a case of death from overwork.The construction firm employee, who began working on the project in December, clocked 200 hours of overtime in the month before his body was found in April with a note that said he had ""reached the physical and mental limit"".According to a government report on death from overwork released on Friday, there were 191 ""karoshi"" cases in the year ending March 2017.The report also showed that 7.7 per cent of employees in Japan regularly log more than 20 hours of overtime a week.In an attempt to tackle the problem, the government in May released its first nationwide employer blacklist, naming-and-shaming more than 300 companies including Dentsu and an arm of Panasonic for breaching labour laws.In February, Japan launched ""Premium Friday"", calling on employees to knock off early on the last Friday of the month.But critics slammed the plan as it was not mandatory and several companies simply opted out."

954,"COPENHAGEN: Denmark looks set to become the next European country to restrict the burqa and the niqab, worn by some Muslim women, after most parties in the Danish parliament backed some sort of ban on facial coverings.Full and partial face veils such as burqas and niqabs divide opinion across Europe, setting advocates of religious freedom against secularists and those who argue that such garments are culturally alien or a symbol of the oppression of women.The niqab covers everything but the eyes, while the burqa also covers the eyes with a transparent veil.France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and the German state of Bavaria have all imposed some restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils in public places.“This is not a ban on religious clothing, this is a ban on masking,” Jacob Ellemann-Jensen, spokesman for the Liberal Party, told reporters on Friday after his party, the largest in the coalition government, decided to back a ban.This would effectively mean a ban on the niqab and the burqa, he added. Around 200 women in Denmark wear such garments, according to researchers.The three-party center-right minority government, its ally the Danish People’s Party and the main opposition Social Democrats have all said they are in favour of a ban, though they are still discussing how the ban should be designed and enforced.“There will come a masking ban in Denmark. That’s how it is,” Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen said on Facebook.His party, the Liberal Alliance, had previously been one of the staunchest opponents of a ban, saying it limited people’s ability to freely choose their attire, but has now aligned its stance with that of the other coalition parties, the Conservatives and the Liberals.“So if it is practically possible to have such a ban without betraying ourselves or our own values, then the Liberal Alliance will vote for it,” Samuelsen said.The Social Democrats, Denmark’s biggest party, has also signaled support in principle for a ban on garments such as the burqa, which it said oppressed women.“We are ready to ban the burqa if that is what it takes ... But there are some dilemmas, not least with regards to how such a ban would be enforced,” said the Social Democrats’ leader Mette Fredriksen during a debate in parliament on Thursday.Norway’s government in June proposed a ban on face-covering Muslim veils in kindergartens, schools and universities."

They were both awarded 10 years in prison under Section 119 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and seven years under Section 201 of the PPC, and fined Rs1 million each for ‘facilitating commission of an offence’.Saud Aziz and Khurram Shahzad have challenged the verdict in the Lahore High Court's Rawalpindi benchAt present, Aziz has retired from the police force whereas Shahzad is the SSP Special Branch in Rawalpindi.They had both challenged their conviction in the LHC’s Rawalpindi Bench which, on Thursday, suspended their conviction and ordered them to submit surety bonds worth Rs0.2 million each. The next hearing in the case is on November 27.The officers had challenged their sentences through their counsels Azam Nazir Tarrar and Raja Ghanim Aabir, and the appeals were heard by a divisional bench comprising Justice Tariq Abbasi and Justice Habibullah Amir.The counsel for the officers argued before the bench that his clients had been blamed for the entire episode whereas the five suspected terrorists were exonerated while then-president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf’s trial was separated as he is an absconder. The petition maintains that FIA has irrefutable evidence against the suspects acquitted by the ATCOn September 29, the Federal Investigative Agency (FIA) filed a petition in the LHC's Rawalpindi Bench challenging the anti-terrorism court's (ATC) decision in the murder case.The petition maintains that the FIA has irrefutable evidence against the acquitted suspects — Aitzaz Shah, Sher Zaman, Abdul Rasheed, Rafaqat Hussain and Hasnain Gul. Meanwhile, the Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) has also challenged the ATC's decision.Speaking to the media after challenging the verdict last month, PPP's Latif Khosa, who was also a counsel in the case, said Benazir had repeatedly stated that Musharraf was not providing her security.Latif Khosa alleges Musharraf posted Saud Aziz to Pindi to ensure his role in the assassination""She had said that Musharraf would be directly responsible in case anything happened to her,"" he said.He also claimed that Musharraf got Aziz, one of the two police officials punished in the case, posted as the Rawalpindi city police officer to ensure his role in the assassination. He accused Aziz of ordering the removal of a security cordon around Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007 so Benazir could be easily killed.Khosa explained that they have filed three appeals on behalf of Benazir's widower and former president Asif Ali Zardari: one challenges the order separating Musharraf's trial from the case, the other is against the 'lenient' sentences against the police officers and the last against the suspected militants exonerated in the case. Bhutto, the PPP chief and two-time former prime minister, was assassinated in a suicide attack at an election campaign rally in Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007.The ATC had reserved verdict on Wednesday in the nine-year-old caseAn FIR over the incident was registered on behalf of the state following which the murder trial of five suspects began in February of 2008. However, once PPP won the 2008 elections, the investigation was handed over to the FIA.More than 300 hearings of the case were held, while over the course of time six judges were changed and seven challans submitted in the trial that began on February 29, 2008."

975,"BARCELONA: Spain could clinch their place in the 2018 World Cup on Friday but the figure of Gerard Pique has cast a shadow on their qualifier with Albania following Sunday´s highly-disputed independence referendum in Catalonia.Barca defender Pique, who voted in the banned referendum and has been outspoken about his home region´s right to decide on its future, was booed upon arrival at the team´s hotel in Alicante on Thursday by around 100 supporters, who urged him to quit the national team.Pique broke down in tears after Barcelona´s win over Las Palmas on Sunday, declaring ""I am Catalan and feel Catalan"" and offered to quit the Spain team if anyone in the side had a problem with his views.Pique also fiercely criticised the Spanish government and prime minister Mariano Rajoy after Catalan officials said over 840 people had been injured in clashes with police as they stormed polling stations across the region.The Barcelona defender was mercilessly booed by Spain fans during an open training session on Monday, prompting him to give a lengthy news conference on Wednesday to explain his views.He insisted he is still proud to represent his country, saying the national team is like a family to him and that he had the support of his team mates and coach Julen Lopetegui, who later gave the defender his backing in a radio interview.Last week, however, Spain captain Sergio Ramos criticised Pique for tweeting in favour of the referendum ahead of the World Cup qualifiers.""Pique´s tweet was not the best thing to do if he doesn’t want to be booed, perhaps the tweet is not the best thing for the group,"" said Ramos, who has been Pique´s centre back partner for Spain since 2012 and is set to play alongside him again against Albania.Spanish media reported that Ramos admonished Pique when the Spain team met up on Monday although Pique said any talk of ill feeling with his team mate was untrue, adding that he gets on ""phenomenally well"" with Ramos and is working on a business project with the Real Madrid defender.Spain are three points clear at the top of their World Cup qualifying group and will seal their spot in Russia on Friday if they better Italy´s result against Macedonia.They travel to Israel on Monday for their final qualifier.Pique´s Barca team mate Sergio Busquets said he would never discuss politics, which was received in the Spanish media as a thinly veiled pop at the defender.""I only focus on playing football and I´m sure it´d be better if everyone else did the same,"" Busquets said in a radio interview.The midfielder backed Pique a day later, but said it was inevitable his team mate would face the wrath of some supporters against Albania.""I´m sure there will be people that boo Pique, this has been happening for a long time,"" Busquets said.""The booing affects us all, it´s not nice, we´re all on the pitch, it doesn´t just affect Pique and we don´t deserve it."

979,"UNITED NATIONS: The Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighting in Yemen on Thursday was placed on a UN blacklist for killing and maiming children, drawing fresh calls from rights groups to step up pressure on Riyadh over the conflict.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres decided to add the coalition to the annual list of shame while noting that it had taken some measures to improve the protection of children.""In Yemen, the actions of the coalition to restore legitimacy in Yemen objectively led to that party being listed for the killing and maiming of children,"" said a report released along with the list as an annex.In 2016, the coalition was responsible for 683 child casualties and for 38 verified attacks on schools and hospitals, it said.Yemen´s government forces, pro-government militias, the Huthi rebels and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) were also cited, but in a separate section of the list that said they had failed to protect children.In a statement released along with the report, Guterres said the blacklist was ""not only to raise awareness"" but also to ""promote measures that can diminish the tragic plight of children in conflict.""The UN chief said he was encouraged that some governments were working with the United Nations to spare children from the horrors of conflict and he voiced hope that ""more will follow.""Guterres spoke to Saudi King Salman ahead of the release of the list, which UN officials had shared with Riyadh months earlier to avoid a repeat of the clash that followed the blacklisting last year.Then UN chief Ban Ki-moon briefly included the coalition to the annual list but was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after Saudi Arabia threatened to cut off funding to UN humanitarian programs.Ban had publicly complained that it was unacceptable for countries to ""exert undue pressure"" on the United Nations to avoid scrutiny of its actions.Saudi Arabia denied that it had pressured Ban and has since insisted that the coalition is respecting its obligations under international humanitarian law.Saudi Ambassador Abdallah al-Mouallimi scheduled a news conference at the United Nations for Friday.The report and the list were on Thursday sent to the Security Council, which includes countries such as the United States, Britain and France that support the coalition in its war against Iran-backed Huthi rebels.Human Rights Watch applauded the decision to include the coalition on the list but disputed the view that the military was taking measures to protect children.""The coalition needs to stop making empty promises to exercise caution, take concrete action to stop these deadly unlawful attacks in Yemen, and allow desperately needed fuel and aid to reach those in need,"" said Jo Becker, HRW´s children´s rights advocate.""Until this happens, governments should suspend all Saudi weapons sales,"" she said.The report said the coalition was responsible for 683 of the total 1,340 child casualties last year in Yemen and for 73 percent of the 52 attacks on schools and hospitals.The Saudi-led Arab military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support the government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi after the Huthis forced him into exile.The United Nations has listed Yemen as the world´s number one humanitarian crisis, with seven million Yemenis on the brink of famine and cholera causing more than 2,000 deaths."
980,"A son of the late actress and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn on Thursday sued a children’s charity bearing her name to stop it from putting the Hepburn name on a wide array of clothing, handbags, portraits, umbrellas and other items.Sean Hepburn Ferrer, who once chaired the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund, accused the charity of infringing trademark and other rights belonging to him and Luca Dotti, his half-brother.Dotti and Ferrer had founded the charity, which was once called Hollywood for Children Inc (HFC), following their mother’s 1993 death at age 63.Ferrer’s lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles follows a lawsuit that the charity filed against him in February in Los Angeles County Superior Court.The charity in its lawsuit said Ferrer’s “increasingly hostile actions” impeded its ability to take part in exhibitions and raise money, and sought to stop his alleged interference.“We stand by the allegations in our state court case,” Steven Young, a lawyer for the charity, said in an interview.“Mr. Ferrer, for reasons known only to him, continues to try to disrupt and destroy the ability of the Audrey Hepburn Children’s Fund to raise money for various children’s charities. We are confident that the judicial process will ensure a just result,” Young said.In Thursday’s lawsuit, Ferrer said he resigned as chairman in 2012 amid disagreements over spending, but let the charity use his mother’s name, persona and legacy case-by-case.He said he has granted no such rights since 2015 and that the charity’s subsequent infringements falsely suggest that he, Dotti or their mother endorsed them.“HFC is contending effectively that it has been granted a perpetual, worldwide license to do whatever it wants with Audrey Hepburn’s name and related intellectual property,” Lawrence Segal, a lawyer for Ferrer, said. “That is not the case.”Dotti did not join his half-brother as a plaintiff. “There is a disagreement between Mr. Ferrer and Mr. Dotti as to the requirements for granting a license,” Segal said.Thursday’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against further infringements.Hepburn starred in many successful 1950s and 1960s films, including “Sabrina,” “Breakfast at Tiffany‘s” and “My Fair Lady.”She devoted much of her later life to charity, becoming a UNICEF goodwill ambassador.US President George H.W. Bush awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom six weeks before her death."
981,"Oil markets opened cautiously in Asia on Friday as traders monitored a tropical storm heading for the Gulf of Mexico and as China remained closed for a week-long public holiday.But the prospect of extended oil production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) helped support prices.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were trading at $50.73 per barrel at 0016 GMT, down 6 cents from their last close.Brent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil prices, were down 6 cents at $56.94 a barrel.Oil market activity was subdued on Friday, due to the ongoing Golden Week holiday in China and because traders were monitoring tropical storm Nate, which is threatening to disrupt the oil industry in the Gulf of Mexico just weeks after several hurricanes pummelled the region, knocking out many oil producing and processing facilities.The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP), one of the country’s most important fuel handling facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, said early on Friday that it had suspended operations until the weather improves.Nate is currently off the coast of Nicaragua and heading northwest into a region of the Gulf of Mexico populated by offshore oil platforms which pump more than 1.6 million barrels of crude per day (bpd), about 17 percent of US output, according to government data.BP and Chevron were shutting production at all Gulf platforms, while Royal Dutch Shell and Anadarko Petroleum suspended some production and drilling activity in the Gulf. Exxon Mobil, Statoil and other producers have withdrawn personnel from their platforms.Despite this, markets were not far off their closing levels from the previous day, when prices rose by around 2 percent on the prospect of an extended production cut deal lead by OPEC and Russia.King Salman of Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de-facto leaders, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Thursday to discuss, among other things, oil policy.Saudi Arabia made no firm pledge to extend a deal between OPEC, Russia and other producers on cutting supplies but said it was “flexible” regarding Moscow’s suggestion to prolong the pact until the end of 2018.“The visit raised the possibility of the current production cut agreement being extended if the crude oil inventories remain stubbornly high,” ANZ bank said.A deal to cut around 1.8 million bpd in production has been in place since January and is currently due to expire at the end of March 2018."

Harder subsequently put out a statement saying the newspaper’s story was defamatory because it relied on “mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report”.The New York Times reported that Weinstein, 65, had reached eight previously undisclosed settlements with women who made allegations of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact.New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha said the newspaper was confident about its reporting, adding that Weinstein “was aware and able to respond to specific allegations in our story before publication”.The alleged victims included an actress, a model, and two assistants and their allegations spanned almost 30 years, the newspaper reported.Reuters has not independently confirmed the New York Times report. Weinstein has not been charged with any crimes.“I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go,” Weinstein said in his initial statement to the New York Times — one that was also provided to Reuters by his lawyers.“I’ve brought on therapists and I plan to take a leave of absence from my company and to deal with this issue head on,” said Weinstein, whose Oscar-winning films include Shakespeare in Love and Chicago.One of the women interviewed by the New York Times was Double Jeopardy actress and singer Ashley Judd.The report quoted Judd as saying that two decades ago she had a meeting with Weinstein in his Beverly Hills hotel room where he asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower.Judd’s representatives did not immediately return requests from Reuters for comment.Weinstein and his brother Bob formed independent movie studio Miramax in 1979. They later sold it and in 2005 set up The Weinstein Company.Weinstein — who is married to Marchesa label fashion designer Georgina Chapman — is the latest US media titan to be accused of sexual harassment.The late Fox News chief Roger Ailes was forced out of the company in July 2016 after being accused of sexual harassment, which he denied."
984,"SAN FRANCISCO: Netflix on Thursday said it is bumping up subscription prices in the US and parts of Europe as the leading online streaming service invests in more shows and features.Shares of the Silicon Valley-based company jumped more than four percent to $192.44 in trading following news of the relatively small price hike.""From time to time, Netflix plans and pricing are adjusted as we add more exclusive TV shows and movies, introduce new product features and improve the overall Netflix experience to help members find something great to watch even faster,"" the company told AFP in an email.A basic plan that offers streaming to a single screen will remain $7.99 monthly in the US.The most popular Netflix plan — which supports high-definition video and allows simultaneous streaming to two screens — was raised a dollar a month to $10.99.A top-level plan that includes super-rich 4k video and watching from four screens at a time got a two-dollar price hike to $13.99 monthly.The price changes applied immediately to new customers and will roll out in the weeks ahead to current subscribers.The price increase was limited to the US as well as a handful of European countries, including France, Britain, and Germany, Netflix said.The streaming giant last raised prices in the US two years ago.Subscription prices were tweaked in Canada, Latin America, and some Nordic countries earlier this year.Netflix subscriptions still came in far cheaper than traditional cable service packages.The company in July reported that ranks of subscribers to its streaming service grew in the second quarter of this year to 103.95 million.Most of the subscriber growth came from outside the US, where Netflix has invested heavily in establishing itself as a global television service.Netflix told investors at the time it was determined to balance boldness and financial discipline as it continued to bolster its programming slate.The company remained committed to investing in original programming, saying it will release 40 feature productions this year ranging from ""big-budget popcorn films to grassroots independent cinema.""Netflix and rival Amazon Prime have been pumping money into original shows to win fans and set themselves apart in an increasingly competitive bid for viewers' time.COVER PHOTO: The Netflix logo can be seen at a Netflix event in Berlin, Germany, March 1, 2017.

985,"ST. LOUIS: Federal Reserve officials have started to push back on the idea that the Trump administration’s tax cut plan would boost the economy, cautioning it could instead trigger high inflation, unsustainable debt, and an eventual return to sub-par growth.Slashing personal or corporate tax rates could boost short-term growth as households and businesses spend more, Fed policymakers acknowledged, but those benefits could prove short-lived due to broad trends like population ageing and rising indebtedness.The remarks about US President Donald Trump’s proposed tax overhaul come as he is ramping up a search for a new Fed chair, promising a decision this month.Unless targeted to raise productivity and underlying potential, a tax cut could feed “unsustainable” growth that could ultimately be undone by asset price bubbles, inflation and possible recession, San Francisco Fed President John Williams told reporters on the sidelines of a community banking conference here on Thursday.”Having policies that don’t kind of maintain this sustainable path, stable inflation, will just end up, we know from history, creating potential recessions or high inflation or other problems and that doesn’t benefit anybody,” he said.White House pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates low in the 1960s in order to boost growth contributed to a subsequent period of so-called stagflation, or low growth and high inflation, in the 1970s, Williams noted.Williams said he feels the economy as it stands now can on average grow 1.5 percent annually, half the 3 percent growth that Trump has promised, without those sorts of problems.While tax code changes and other reforms could raise potential, Williams said early analysis of such proposals show they “mostly boost demand and tend to have relatively small” impacts on things like labour supply and productivity growth.Fed officials have traditionally hesitated to speak directly about fiscal issues, leaving tax and spending matters to elected officials. Government officials similarly refrain from commenting on or trying to influence Fed policy.But the fate of the administration’s tax proposal, its effect on the economy and the Fed’s possible reaction to it are major unknowns for an economy that is doing well in many respects, with low unemployment and sustained growth since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.The Trump administration has proposed $6 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts at a time when many economists feel the country is not in need of massive stimulus.Many of the tax plan details need to be worked out on Capitol Hill, but the broad idea is to offset most of the government revenue lost through lower tax rates by eliminating some tax deductions and loopholes, relying on faster economic growth to take care of the rest.Some of the deductions are already in trouble in Congress, while the effect that tax cuts will have on growth is a matter of controversy even among economists reportedly under consideration by Trump for Fed chair.Stanford visiting fellow and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, Columbia University business school dean Glenn Hubbard, and Stanford University professor John Taylor, in a general endorsement of the thrust of Trump’s plans, argued in a mid-July report that tax cuts could raise productivity and bring enough people back into the workforce to boost economic growth to 3 percent.But they said that would only happen if the tax cuts were paired with restrictions on entitlement spending, an idea Trump opposed as a candidate when he promised to protect Social Security and Medicare.“Tax reform and spending reductions go hand-in-hand,” wrote the group.Warsh, in particular, is considered a possible contender to replace Fed Chair Janet Yellen.”Without significant spending restraint, even with positive effects on economic growth, the tax rate reductions would likely be limited and temporary, limiting their economic benefits.”Dallas Federal Reserve bank president Robert Kaplan earlier this week warned that tax cuts on their own may trade short-term growth for long-term damage.“My concern is you would create a bump in (gross domestic product) that would be short term, you would then decline back down to trend growth except when you declined back down you would be more leveraged than when you started,” he said."
986,"LAS VEGAS: The city had spent years planning for the worst: training its police force according to an anti-terrorism protocol it adopted in 2009 to respond to mass shootings, chemical attacks, suicide bombings, and planes flying into buildings, according to city officials and security professionals.But when it came to Sunday night’s attack that killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more at an open-air concert in the city, police found themselves with few options to stop the gunman quickly, they said.It underscored the difficulty American cities face in protecting citizens from attacks that can take unpredictable forms.Firing at night from the 32nd floor of a hotel near the city’s world-famous neon-lit Strip at a range of 500 yards with an arsenal of high-velocity semi-automatic weapons modified to shoot rapidly, gunman Stephen Paddock had pulled the city into a nightmare that left him virtually unopposed for crucial minutes, with police unable to safely return fire.The angles, the distances, and the presence of thousands of people made it impossible, they said.“Our officers showed incredible restraint. They can fire that distance. It’s not safe to do so,” Robert Chamberlin — a member of the Las Vegas police department’s counter-terrorism force — said.“You are firing 32 floors up, from 500 meters (yards). So the trajectory of our rounds… even if we were accurate, they’re going to go up into the ceiling, up into the next floor.”“(Our officers) knew they had to close [in] so that’s what they did,” he said.Paddock sprayed bullets continuously on the concert crowd of 22,000 people for about 10 minutes, starting at 10:05 PM PT (1:05 AM ET on Monday), according to Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo.Police blew open Paddock’s hotel room door 75 minutes after the shooting started, finding he had killed himself.Paddock’s attack was only the second major mass shooting in modern US history where the gunman fired from an elevated position, according to David Shepherd — a former FBI agent who advises the Las Vegas police department on security issues.The last one that inflicted large numbers of casualties was at the University of Texas in 1966 when a gunman in a tower killed 15 people and wounded 31 during an attack that lasted 96 minutes.The Las Vegas police adopted in 2009 a new, military-style, counter-terrorism plan and training called Multi-Assault Counter-Terrorism Action Capabilities (MACTAC) and intended to help it deal with attacks.Officials said it was instituted as a response to the attack on Mumbai, India, a year earlier, in which al Qaeda-linked militants killed 166 people in a series of coordinated shootings and bombings over four days.The protocol required every law enforcement officer from every department in the region to be trained in the same way to respond to attacks, members of the MACTAC team told Reuters in an interview this week.This training allowed security personnel from different departments to team up quickly, form small units, and — in the case of a shooting — to direct fire at the shooter’s location from different angles.On Sunday, Paddock’s high perch in a hotel filled with people complicated the well-trained response — first, because it was hard to exactly pinpoint his location, and second because of the dangers to bystanders if the police fired back.“It did cause some challenges logistically, being outgunned like that,” Lieutenant Reggie Rader — one of the MACTAC team members — said.Rader said officers did their best to get as quickly as possible to the hotel room from which Paddock was firing.City councilmen Ricki Barlow and Steve Seroka praised the police for how they responded to Sunday’s attack but admitted the shooter proved a difficult adversary, and that being prepared for every kind of attack is hard.“Someone shooting high down into a crowd — of course we have looked at that. But the question becomes — how do you guard against that?” Barlow said.Seroka said that many hotels in Las Vegas are equipped with technology to detect projectiles like cigarette butts coming off balconies and to pinpoint the room, but said there are no balconies at the Mandalay Bay hotel where Paddock had set up.Seroka — a former US Air Force colonel and veteran of both Gulf Wars — lamented the length of time Paddock ultimately had to shoot at the crowd.”Nine minutes is an eternity when you are taking fire,” he said.But he added, “There is an old saying: no plan survives the first contact with the enemy. You cannot anticipate every possibility.”"
987,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the landmark international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a senior administration official said on Thursday, in a step that potentially could cause the 2015 accord to unravel.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump is also expected to roll out a broader US strategy on Iran that would be more confrontational. The Trump administration has frequently criticized Iran’s conduct in the Middle East.Trump — who has called the pact an “embarrassment” and “the worst deal ever negotiated” — has been weighing whether it serves US security interests as he faces an October 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.“We must not allow Iran… to obtain nuclear weapons,” Trump said during a meeting with military leaders at the White House on Thursday.“The Iranian regime supports terrorism and exports violence, bloodshed and chaos across the Middle East. That is why we must put an end to Iran’s continued aggression and nuclear ambitions. They have not lived up to the spirit of their agreement,” he added.Asked about his decision on whether to certify the landmark deal, Trump said, “You’ll be hearing about Iran very shortly.”Supporters say its collapse could trigger a regional arms race and worsen Middle East tensions, while opponents say it went too far in easing sanctions without requiring that Iran end its nuclear program permanently.Iranian authorities have repeatedly said Tehran would not be the first to violate the accord, under which Iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions that had crippled its economy.If Trump declines to certify Iran’s compliance, US congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran suspended under the agreement.Whether Congress would be willing to reimpose sanctions is far from clear. While Republicans — and some Democrats — opposed the deal when it was approved in 2015, there is little obvious appetite in Congress for dealing with the Iran issue now.The prospect that Washington could renege on the pact — which was signed by the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, the European Union, and Iran — has worried some of the US allies that helped negotiate it.“We, the Europeans, we have hammered this: the agreement is working,” said a European diplomat who asked to remain anonymous. “We as Europeans, have repeated… it’s impossible to reopen the agreement. Period. It’s impossible.”French President Emmanuel Macron said last month there was no alternative to the nuclear accord, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).A senior Iranian diplomat told Reuters on Thursday the end result of Trump’s expected move would be to isolate the United States since the Europeans would continue to support it.“Many foreign investors told us that they will not be scared away from Iran’s market if Trump de-certifies the deal,” the diplomat said.Trump has long criticized the pact, a signature foreign policy achievement of his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.The administration was considering October 12 for Trump to give a speech on Iran but no final decision had been made, an official said previously.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — a close ally of Trump — last month said that unless provisions in the accord removing restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program over time are eliminated, it should be cancelled.“Fix it, or nix it,” Netanyahu said in a speech at the UN General Assembly annual gathering of world leaders on September 19.Many of Trump’s fellow Republicans who control Congress also have been critical of the deal.Trump blasted the deal in his speech to the UN General Assembly, also on September 19.“We cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,” Trump said, adding that Iran’s government “masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy”.Trump is weighing a strategy that could allow more aggressive US responses to Iran’s forces, its proxies in Iraq and Syria, and its support for militant groups.Jim Mattis — Trump’s defence secretary — told a congressional hearing on Tuesday that Iran was “fundamentally” in compliance with the agreement.He also said the United States should consider staying in the deal unless it were proven that Tehran was not abiding by it or that it was not in the US national interest to do so.When Mattis was asked by a senator whether he thought staying in the deal was in the US national security interest, he replied, “Yes, senator, I do.”Last week, Iran’s foreign minister said Tehran may abandon the deal if Washington decides to withdraw.A State Department official said the Trump administration was “fully committed to addressing the totality of Iranian threats and malign activities and seeks to bring about a change in the Iranian regime’s behaviour”.The official said that behavior includes ballistic missiles proliferation, “support for terrorism,” support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, “unrelenting hostility to Israel,” “consistently threatening freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf,” cyber attacks against the United States and its allies, human rights abuses, and “arbitrary detentions of US citizens.””The JCPOA was expected to contribute to regional and international peace and security, and Iran’s regime is doing everything in its power to undermine peace and security,” the State Department official added.The move also would represent another step by Trump that would undo key parts of Obama’s legacy.If Trump moves to decertify the accord, it would mark another example of walking away from international commitments as he pursues his nationalist “America First” agenda.He previously announced plans to abandon the Paris climate accord and the ambitious 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, two key Obama achievements."
988,"LOS ANGELES: A record 92 countries have entered the race hoping to snag an Oscar for best foreign language film at next year's awards, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on Thursday.Among the contenders that have created a buzz this year is Angelina Jolie's First They Killed My Father from Cambodia, Robin Camillo's BPM (Beats Per Minute) from France, Ziad Doueiri's The Insult from Lebanon, and Joachim Trier's Thelma from Norway.Swedish art world satire The Square, directed by Ruben Ostlund, was the shock winner at the Cannes Film Festival this year and is also among the contenders.First-time entrants include Haiti (Ayiti Mon Amour), Lao People's Democratic Republic (Dearest Sister) and Syria (Little Gandhi).Last year's Oscar for best foreign language film went to Iranian director Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman.Farhadi boycotted the ceremony over US President Donald Trump's visa ban barring citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iran, from entering the United States.Nominations for the 90th Academy Awards will be announced on January 23 and the glitzy ceremony will be held on March 4 in Hollywood."
989,"NEW YORK: A Seattle-area startup, backed by the venture capital arms of Boeing Co (BA.N) and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) announced plans on Thursday to bring a small hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022.The small airliner is the first of several planes planned by Zunum Aero, which said it would seat up to 12 passengers and be powered by two electric motors, dramatically reducing the travel time and cost of trips under 1,000 miles (1,600 km).Zunum’s plans and timetable underscore a rush to develop small electric aircraft based on rapidly evolving battery technology and artificial intelligence systems that avoid obstacles on a road or in the sky.In a separate but related development, Boeing said on Thursday it plans to acquire a company that specializes in electric and autonomous flight to help its own efforts to develop such aircraft.Several companies, including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and European planemaker Airbus (AIR.PA), are working on electric-powered self-flying cars.Zunum does not expect to be the first to certify an electric-powered aircraft with regulators. Rather, it is aiming to fill a market gap for regional travel by airlines, where private jets and commercial jetliners are too costly for many to use.Zunum’s planes would fly from thousands of small airports around big cities to cut regional travel times and costs.“Airlines are very keen to know how to fly a shorter distance and make money on it,” Matt Knapp, co-founder and chief aeronautic engineer of the Kirkland, Washington-based company, said in an interview.A flight from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, for instance, would leave from Palo Alto, San Carlos, Hayward or Reid Hillview airports and arrive in Santa Monica, Burbank, Hawthorne or San Gabriel Valley airports. The cost would be about $120 one way, the company said.The travel time of over four hours would be cut in half by avoiding the crowds and security lines at big hubs that are required for larger planes. About 96 percent of US air traffic travels through 1 percent of its airports, leaving thousands of small airports virtually untapped, Knapp said.Electric-vehicle batteries, such as those made by Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Panasonic Corp (6752.T), would power Zunum’s motors, although Zunum has no commitment with either company. A supplemental jet-fuel engine and electrical generator would be used to give the plane a range of 700 miles and ensure it stays aloft after the batteries are exhausted, Knapp saidZunum plans to make a larger plane seating up to 50 passengers at the end of the next decade, and the range of both would increase to about 1,000 miles as battery technology improves, Knapp said.The planes eventually would fly solely on battery power, and are being designed to fly with one pilot and to eventually be remotely piloted, he added.Recent advances in battery technology, lightweight electric motors and carbon composite airframes would cut the cost of flying Zunum’s aircraft to about eight cents per seat-mile, about one-fifth that of a small jet or turboprop plane, Knapp said.“We’re getting airline pricing down on a small plane and doing it for short distances,” Knapp said. “That kind of aircraft doesn’t currently exist.”Zunum first announced its plans for hybrid-electric aircraft in April, and revealed that Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures had invested in its initial round of venture funding. On Thursday it disclosed specifications and a timetable for the vehicle entering service.Zunum says the plane would cruise at about 340 miles an hour and at altitudes of about 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) - slower and lower than conventional jets.The motor, which Zunum is designing, will drive a fan similar to the bypass fan on a jet engine, but without a jet’s combustion. Zunum has started talks with plane makers about building the airframe, and it is building non-flying prototypes of the powertrain to test batteries, the electrical system, software and other components, Knapp said.Current battery technology can only power the plane for about 100 miles so a gas-powered engine would be used to generate electricity to power the motors for additional range."
990,"QUETTA: The registration of 3,250 non-governmental organisations (NGO) working in Balochistan has been cancelled, as per the National Action Plan (NAP).The NAP was put in force by the government after the devastating December 2014 attack on an army school in Peshawar which left over 140, mostly children, dead. Officials said the department of social welfare and department of industries are responsible for registration of NGOs in Balochistan. Prior to the NAP, the social welfare department had registered 2,000 NGOs while around 1,900 were registered with the industries department of which 620 were educational and 1,280 non-educational. As per the NAP, the industries department has cancelled the registration of 1,650 NGOs. Now only 250 NGOs are registered with it. "
991,"LAS VEGAS: The US gun lobby, which has seldom embraced new firearms-control measures, voiced a readiness on Thursday to restrict a rifle accessory that enabled a Las Vegas gunman to strafe a crowd with bursts of sustained fire as if from an automatic weapon.Police have said the gunman, Stephen Paddock, equipped 12 of his weapons with so-called bump-stock devices that allow semi-automatic rifles to operate as if they were fully automatic machine guns, which are otherwise outlawed in the United States.Authorities said his ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over the course of 10 minutes from his perch in a 32nd-floor hotel suite was a major factor in the high casualty count of 58 people killed and hundreds wounded. Paddock, 64, killed himself before police stormed his suite.The carnage on Sunday night across the street from the Mandalay Bay hotel ranked as the bloodiest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, surpassing the 49 people shot to death last year at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.The influential National Rifle Association (NRA), which staunchly opposed moves to tighten gun control laws following the Orlando massacre and others, said on Thursday that bump stocks, which remain legal, “should be subject to additional regulations.”Senior Republicans also signaled they were ready to deal with the sale of bump stocks - an accessory gun control advocates regard as work-arounds to bans on machine-guns.“Clearly that’s something we need to look into,” House Speaker Paul Ryan told radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt.“I didn’t even know what they were until this week ... I think we’re quickly coming up to speed with what this is,” Ryan said.The No. 2 Republican senator had called for a review of bump stocks a day earlier. Democrats were already urging new legislation, as the shooting reignited the long-standing U.S. debate over regulation of gun ownership, protected under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.US Representative Steve Scalise, a member of the Republican House leadership who is himself a victim of gun violence, voiced concern that hasty congressional action to restrict bump stocks could lead to wider limits on “the rights of gun owners.”"
992,"NEW YORK: Experimental icons Radiohead and rock-activists Rage Against the Machine were nominated Thursday for the first time to enter the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, vying in a field that includes singing legend Nina Simone.Two British acts who were major cultural forces in the 1980s -- New Wave duo Eurythmics and the darkly emotive Kate Bush -- were also in the running for the first time for spots in the shrine to rock culture, which will induct its latest class on April 14 in Cleveland.Radiohead and Rage Against the Machine received nominations in their first year of eligibility -- 25 years after releasing their first recording -- often a sign that chances of making the cut are good. Winners will be announced in December after voting by more than 900 artists, historians and others in the music industry, along with an online fan poll that accounts for one ballot.Radiohead emerged in the guitar-driven alternative scene of the early 1990s but helped reshape the direction of rock with 1997´s ""OK Computer"" and ""Kid A"" three years later.On the albums, the Oxford, England-based band led by Thom Yorke presciently sensed the growing power of the internet, embracing electronics in the music all the while warning of technology´s corrosive effects on society.Rage Against the Machine was a frontrunner in merging metal and hip-hop but became most identified with left-wing politics. With a punk spirit, Rage´s frontman Zack de la Rocha and guitarist Tom Morello have vociferously attacked US foreign policy and capitalism itself, while shedding an international spotlight on Mexico´s Zapatista insurgents.The nomination of Simone comes as the Hall of Fame gradually expands the definition of rock ´n´ roll. As Ice Cube said while being inducted with gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A. last year, rock is not a musical style but ""a spirit.""Simone, who died in 2003 in France, brought a classical sensibility to Gospel and jazz to become one of the 20th century´s defining singers. She was also a passionate advocate for racial equality, with civil rights songs such as ""Young, Gifted and Black.""She has enjoyed a renewed spotlight following a 2015 Netflix documentary, ""What Happened, Miss Simone?""Another late singer nominated for the first time was Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Gospel singer of the 1930s and 1940s whose melodic voice and engaging stage presence influenced early rockers.Kate Bush in a later era also become a model for a generation of singers with the yelping cries of her dramatic soprano voice and an artistic approach that cared little about pop hits.Eurythmics, on the other hand, found worldwide success starting with the 1983 album ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These)."" Singer Annie Lennox, who performed with producer David A. Stewart, has since been an outspoken advocate for human rights and global development.Also receiving their first nominations were three British bands -- blues rockers Dire Straits, R&B-influenced prog-rockers The Moody Blues and theatrical metalheads Judas Priest.Dire Straits -- whose hits included ""Money for Nothing"" and ""Sultans of Swing"" -- broke up in 1995, raising the prospect of a reunion if the band is inducted.The Hall of Fame could also bring back together the original lineup of Bon Jovi, one of 10 acts in the running that have been nominated before.Longtime Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, who quit in 2013, took to social media urging fans to vote for the arena-packing anthem rockers.Other acts in the running include The J. Geils Band, the feel-good rockers behind ""Centerfold"" whose namesake guitarist died in April, as well as Detroit punk forerunners MC5, British Invasion-era group The Zombies and late guitarist Link Wray, who popularized the three-fingered ""power chord"" so prevalent in metal.Depeche Mode, which has generated a string of synth-pop hits while maintaining an underground appeal, was nominated for a second straight year.Other nominees were rapper LL Cool J, New Wavers The Cars, Chaka Khan´s Chicago funk greats Rufus, and The Meters, the New Orleans funk band that backed up the late Allen Toussaint.One notable absence was disco titans Chic, who have been nominated a record 11 times without winning. But Chic´s main force, guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers, was inducted this year in a special category for his supporting role in music."

995,"SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said about 51,000 illegal firearms, a fifth of all illegal guns in the country, were surrendered in a three-month amnesty ending on Friday.Turnbull said Australia’s tough gun ownership laws, which ban all semi-automatic rifles and semi-automatic shotguns, severely limit the chances of a Las Vegas style mass shooting.“The killer there (in Las Vegas) had a collection of semi-automatic weapons which a person in his position would simply not be able to acquire in Australia,” Turnbull told reporters in Sydney.American Stephen Paddock, 64, was armed with multiple assault rifles and opened fired on an outdoor country music festival in Las Vegas from a high-rise hotel window on Sunday, killing 58 people before shooting himself in the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.The shooting has focused attention on gun ownership rules in the United States.Australia’s tough gun ownership laws were introduced after the massacre of 35 people by a lone gunman at the former prison colony of Port Arthur in the island state of Tasmania in 1996.The country has had no mass shootings since.The three-month amnesty was the first in 20 years in Australia and the weapons collected will be destroyed.Among them were 19th century guns, a homemade machine gun, a rocket launcher and a pistol small enough to fit in the palm of a hand, according to a government statement."
996,"NEW YORK: Oil prices rose about 2 percent on Thursday as signs Saudi Arabia and Russia would limit production through next year pushed the US benchmark back above $50 a barrel.The news outweighed Wednesday’s US data showing record US exports and the return of production at a major Libyan oilfield.Brent futures settled at $57 a barrel, up 2.2 percent, or $1.20, while US crude rose 81 cents, or 1.6 percent, to end at $50.79.Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week that a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, including Russia, to cut oil output to boost prices could be extended to the end of 2018, instead of expiring in March 2018.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Moscow would support new countries joining the agreement to restrict oil supply.The statement came as Saudi Arabia’s King Salman visited Moscow.“Putin and Salman will most likely reach, but not announce, an agreement to extend the OPEC/non-OPEC production deal, though with a commitment to taper the cuts,” said Eurasia Group.President Donald Trump was expected to announce soon that he will decertify the landmark international deal to curb Iran’s nuclear program, a senior administration official said on Thursday, in a step that could lead to renewed US sanctions against Tehran and could limit Iranian sales of oil.“It would make it difficult for barrels to be transacted through US dollars,” Bernadette Johnson — the vice president of market intelligence at Drillinginfo.com in Denver — said. “A lot would continue to flow, but that’s probably a million barrels that is at risk.”With the increase in prices to above $50, producers have started hedging more heavily, said Johnson.That would buffer drillers against losses if the price were to decline, which may spur more US production — partially offsetting the OPEC-led deal to cut supply by about 1.8 million barrels per day (BPD).Other factors also weighed on oil prices, including the return to production of Libya’s Sharara oilfield on Wednesday after an armed brigade forced a two-day shutdown.US crude oil exports jumped to 1.98 million BPD last week, surpassing the 1.5 million BPD record set the previous week, the Energy Information Administration said.The increase followed a widening of the discount for US crude against Brent, making US oil attractive on world markets."
997,"NEW YORK: World stock markets hit fresh highs on Thursday amid investor optimism over US tax reforms and global economic growth, while the dollar gained as data pointed to solid US growth.The US trade deficit fell in August as exports of goods and services rose to the highest level in more than 2-1/2 years. Separately, the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week.Gold dipped on news of the data as it bolstered the notion US interest rates would be hiked in December. Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker said he was still pencilling in one more rate hike this year and three in 2018.The dollar index — tracking the greenback against a basket of key currencies — held under seven-week highs as investors awaited Friday’s US jobless report for September to assess the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.The storms proved a drag on robust business spending that was seen in the trade data.MSCI’s all-country world stock index edged higher to set a new intraday peak, while the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all set fresh highs.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 41.22 points (or 0.18 percent) to 22,702.86. The S&P 500 gained 5.99 points (or 0.24 percent) to 2,543.73, and the Nasdaq Composite added 15.08 points (or 0.23 percent) to 6,549.71.European bourses also gained, with the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.16 percent to 1,535.03.A Reuters poll showed global stocks will continue to climb over the coming year on rising optimism about growth worldwide. However, a slim majority of equity strategists also expect the current eight-year bull run to end in 2018.US investors have begun to warm to the notion that reform of US fiscal policy will occur by the first quarter, Phil Orlando — chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York — said.Most investors felt that nothing would come of President Donald Trump’s tax reform effort until last week, he said.“Only 30 percent of us were comfortable that something might happen. That could take up 2019 estimates for GDP growth and earnings per share, which could drive the S&P 500 above our 3,000 [point] target,” Orlando said.Oil prices rose as signs Saudi Arabia and Russia would limit production through next year outweighed record US exports and the return of production at a major Libyan oilfield.Brent rose $1.19 to $56.99 per barrel, while US crude rose 96 cents to $50.94 per barrel.The dollar index rose 0.44 percent, with the euro down 0.41 percent to $1.1711. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.07 percent versus the greenback at 112.70."
998,"A cocktail of three antibodies has shown promise in preventing Zika virus infection in monkeys, and moves next into trials in humans, researchers said Wednesday.The mosquito-borne Zika virus swept across Latin America, the Caribbean and southern United States in 2015 and 2016, sparking a global health emergency due to its ability to cause brain-related birth defects.While the threat posed by Zika has subsided somewhat because people cannot become infected twice, researchers are pressing on with attempts to develop the first vaccine to prevent Zika infection and its most dangerous complication, microcephaly in fetuses and babies.""This is a promising intervention to prevent and treat Zika virus infection during pregnancy,"" said David Watkins, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine.""We would like to develop this antibody combination and get it into clinical trials as soon as possible.""Researchers identified three potent antibodies called SMZAb1, SMZAb2 and SMZAb5, isolated from a South American patient.""We administered a cocktail of these three antibodies to nonhuman primates one day before challenging them with Zika virus that had been isolated from a pregnant woman during the 2016 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro,"" said Watkins.""To our surprise, this prophylactic treatment completely prevented the virus from taking hold in the animals.""Researchers found no measurable virus levels in the blood of the four animals treated with the monoclonal combination, and no immune system response, indicating the virus had been blocked completely, said the report in the journal Science Translational Medicine.Four monkeys that were not given the antibodies before being exposed to Zika became ill with the virus for seven days.""Since these antibodies have exceptional safety profiles in humans and cross the placenta, this combination could be rapidly developed to protect uninfected pregnant women and their fetuses,"" Watkins said."
999,"BRUSSELS: Kashmir Council-Europe (KC-EU) is set to launch a week-long program pertaining to the disputed Indo-Pak border region here on Monday.Kashmir EU Week — the annual cultural event organised by the KC-EU in collaboration with other Europe-based Kashmiri organisations — is set to run from October 9 to November 12, 2017.Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider will be honouring the event with his presence as the chief guest. He will be accompanied by AJK Senior Minister of Planning & Housing Chaudhry Tariq Farooq.A collection of photos prepared by a French photographer on the Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) would also be shown at the exhibition. Numerous people, including members of the European Union parliament, scholars, intellectuals, and human rights activists from home and abroad have been invited to attend.Addressing a press conference here about the program, Ali Raza Syed — the Chairman of the KC-EU — said, ""‘Kashmir EU Week’ will comprise seminars, an international conference, debates, as well as a photography and handicraft exhibition [centred around] Kashmir.""""Creating awareness about the large-scale human rights violations in IoK is the main objective of the program,"" Syed added. He hopes that experts and parliamentarians would attend the opening ceremony as well as other programs scheduled during the Kashmir EU-Week.The KC-EU's event has been an annual festivity for many years, apart from several other programs, such as conferences, seminars, and debates geared towards raising awareness regarding Kashmir.Most of these programs were held at diplomatic, political, research, and educational institutions of Europe.The chairman — who is also the program coordinator — commented on how the Kashmiri people have offered unparalleled sacrifices for the resolution of the internationally-acknowledged dispute, adding that the use of brutal force cannot stop them from continuing their struggle for self-determination.Kashmiris are determined to continue their peaceful struggle for the liberation of their region, he stated.Urging the global fraternity to leap to action, Syed stressed that it is the duty of the international community to help find an amicable resolution for Kashmir — a well-talked-about topic at conferences and summits around the world."
1000,"KARACHI: Another woman was attacked with a sharp object in Karachi’s Pehlwan Goth vicinity late Thursday, after the police arrested 15 suspects on Wednesday night and another key suspect early Thursday.According to the police, the 28-year-old woman was attacked, who got her hand injured as she tried to resist the attacker. She was then rushed to a private hospital in Gulistan-e-Jauhar, the police say.The total number of reported knife-attacks on women has shot up to 15, with the First Information Reports (FIRs) of three incidents registered at the Shahrah-e-Faisal and Gulistan-e-Jauhar police station.Last week, fear gripped residents of Gulistan-e-Jauhar area after reports surfaced of a ‘knife attacker’ targeting women in the area. The incidents occur over a span of three hours in Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Gulshan-e-Iqbal areas and surroundingsAfter five women were attacked, within a span of three hours, on Wednesday in areas including Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Gulistan-e-Jamal, the Sindh Information Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that law enforcement agencies were actively engaged in the manhunt and would arrest the ‘culprit within a day or two.’A motorcyclist wearing a black helmet is reportedly attacking women in Gulistan-e-Jauhar area of Karachi The attacker seems to have posed a challenge to the law enforcement authorities, who are yet to nab the assailant.The first incident, in the chain of attacks, was reported on September 25. Since then, a total of 13 attacks have been reported.The FIR of an attack on Shaheen on September 26 was registered by the police on Wednesday, after repeated requests from the victim's family.The incidents have sparked fear and panic among the residents of the metropolis, forcing women to take extra precautions before venturing out.The lone attacker 'appears to be a lean man in his 20s,' says DIG East Sultan KhawajaA female student of Karachi University (KU) said police officers have advised women to be careful while walking on the streets.“We have been directed to not leave our houses after Maghrib prayers,” explained another student.Female students also said that they are taking all possible precautions, including avoiding walking alone at night and not staying out for too long.A KU student said that the attacker seems to be suffering from a psychological disorder. “Normal people do not commit such acts,” she said.Another student noted that government should take notice of the issue and resolve it immediately.Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the continued attacks on women and called Sindh Inspector General AD Khowaja.“What is happening and why the police have failed to arrest the culprit,” said Shah, adding that the attacks appeared to be a move to trigger fear and chaos in the metropolis.Separately, the IGP Sindh directed the SSP East to take concrete steps to ensure the arrest of the attacker.Karachi Police released pictures — screengrabs from the CCTV footage — of the suspect Saturday night, wherein the assailant can be seen riding a motorbike moments before attacking one of the victims.Additional Inspector General (AIG) Mushtaq Ahmed Mahar said that it was likely that the attacker was suffering from psychological problems.“We don’t deny that these incidents are taking place but it is our request to the media not to blow these events out of proportion,” the AIG said.“By giving extra coverage to these incidents, the attacker has gotten cheap publicity and possibly encouragement to commit more attacks,” he insisted, adding that the police are studying similar incidents that took place in Faisalabad and Rawalpindi."
1001,"LONDON: Harry Kane’s stoppage-time goal earned England a 1-0 victory over Slovenia on Thursday and a place at next year’s World Cup finals although his last-gasp effort barely masked a sterile Wembley display by the hosts.The England skipper pounced from close range to convert Kyle Walker’s cross in the 94th minute after a night of frustration for Gareth Southgate’s misfiring team in a half-full stadium.A draw would have sufficed thanks to Slovakia’s 1-0 defeat away to Scotland but Kane’s effort, his 14th of the season in all competitions for club and country, at least prevented the inevitable boos that would have greeted a goalless stalemate.It was Kane’s second real chance of the evening -- his other effort being well saved by Jan Oblak early in the first half.England top Group F with 23 points to second-placed Scotland’s 17 and have one game to go in Lithuania on Sunday. They have now not lost in 38 qualifying matches.While England’s display will not raise too many hopes of great things in Russia, at least in Kane they have a striker who gives them a puncher’s chance of making progress.He now has 11 goals from 22 appearances for England.“We have qualified, and that’s all that matters. We had to be patient and in the last 10 minutes they were getting tired,” Tottenham Hotspur’s Kane, who wore the captain’s armband for the third time and the first time at home, said.“It’s no easy feat these days (to reach a World Cup). We’re all delighted. We have another game on Sunday and we need to keep doing what we’re doing and working hard.”Some England fans were reduced to crafting paper aeroplanes for amusement during a turgid second half in which Slovenia began to threaten a shock victory to boost their own hopes.Each time a paper plane reached the pitch a huge cheer rang around Wembley, such was the scant nature of the entertainment being served up by Southgate’s lacklustre side.Southgate admitted afterwards that the performance was not up to scratch, but echoed Kane’s comments.“We would have liked to have been more fluid and score more goals but they were a side that came to defend,” Southgate, who took over from Sam Allardyce a year ago after one qualifying game, told reporters.“It was frustrating. Was it the performance we wanted? Absolutely not. But the objective was to qualify for Russia.”The home side began brightly enough with Manchester United youngster Marcus Rashford causing problems up front.Kane got his first sight of goal after 15 minutes and worked Oblak with a 25-metre shot the keeper gathered near his post.Rashford also whipped in a devilish cross that needed only a slight touch from someone to have opened the scoring.Slovenia had a half-hearted penalty appeal turned down when Josip Ilicic went down under a challenge from keeper Joe Hart.Atletico Madrid’s Oblak made good saves from Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling and Rashford before halftime.If England were unconvincing before the break they lost all momentum after it. Slovenia’s Bojan Jokic met a floated cross with a downward header just after the break which Hart fumbled slightly before smothering.Hart also had to race off his line late on as Slovenia began to sense the unease in the home ranks.Hundreds of fans had already left the stadium when Oblak’s ambitious throw-out was intercepted by Walker and the right back drove forward before whipping in a cross that Kane met with just enough force for the ball to squirm past the keeper."
1002,"WASHINGTON: The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the September 21 collision of a civilian drone and a US Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter near Staten Island, New York, as concerns mount over the rising number of unmanned aircraft in US airspace.The safety board said on Thursday the helicopter had landed safely but that its main rotor blade, window frame and transmission deck were damaged.Lieutenant Colonel Joe Buccino — a spokesman for the 82nd Airborne Division — said the Army had concluded that the helicopter was not being targeted and was struck by a drone being operated by a hobbyist.The helicopter was flying at about 500 feet (152 metres) when the drone struck the side of the aircraft, he said. The helicopter was repaired within 24 hours with only minor damage and was in New York to assist in security efforts for the United Nations General Assembly.The NTSB said it had recovered a motor and arm from the DJI Phantom 4 drone from the helicopter, identified and interviewed the drone operator and reviewed data logs for the flight.China-based DJI said it was assisting the agency.“DJI is firmly committed to the safety of our products,” the company said. “We have always instructed drone operators to obey the laws and regulations applicable to drones in their jurisdiction.”Government and private-sector officials are concerned that dangerous or even hostile drones could get too close to places like military bases, airports and sports stadiums.Earlier this year, the US Federal Aviation Administration banned drone flights over 133 US military facilities.In August, the Pentagon said US military bases could shoot down drones that endanger aviation safety or pose other threats.Also on Thursday, the FAA began banning drone flights over 10 US landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty in New York and Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota, at the request of national security and law enforcement agencies.The FAA and US Interior Department barred drone flights up to 400 feet (122 metres) within the boundaries of sites including the USS Constitution in Boston, the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, and Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia.The list also includes Folsom Dam and Shasta Dam in California, Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona, Hoover Dam in Nevada and Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state.The restrictions were announced last week.The Trump administration said in June that it wanted to promote drones.The Obama administration implemented rules opening the skies to small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering allowing expanded drone use for purposes such as deliveries, where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. "
1003,"LONDON: Kazuo Ishiguro, the 62-year-old British novelist of Japanese origin who won the Nobel Prize for Literature on Thursday, once wanted to be a rock star, then became a social worker and only later in life turned to writing.Born in Japan and raised in England speaking Japanese at home, his writing has consistently explored this duality, something he credits with aiding his appeal.""I've always looked at the world partly through my parents' eyes... (and) had a part of me that was Japanese,"" he said on Thursday in the garden of the north London home he shares with his wife.""That was quite good for me as a writer at the time when I was writing, because literature started to become very international.""A prodigious writer since the early 1980s, he has penned eight books -- as well as scripts for film and television -- which have been translated into dozens of foreign languages and won numerous awards.But the author has remained more reclusive than some of his contemporary peers.Ishiguro is still best known for ""The Remains of the Day"", which landed the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1989 and was turned into an Oscar-nominated film starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson.He later admitted to writing the book in a prolific four-week period.He has also found fame more recently with ""Never Let Me Go"", his 2005 novel, and ""When We Were Orphans"", published in 2000.In awarding their prize on Thursday, the Nobel committee noted Ishiguro was most associated with themes of memory, time and self-delusion.Despite his enviable success, Ishiguro has appeared modest in interviews.""I'm not a very inspired person,"" he told the Financial Times in 1995. ""I don't have a lot of ideas.""Asked what made novelists choose their often precarious occupation, he replied: ""I won't say writers are crazy people because I don't care for stereotypes. But something is sufficiently out of line in their structure as people.""Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan, in 1954, but moved to England aged five, when his father began research at the National Institute of Oceanography.Intended as only a temporary move, the family eventually settled permanently in Guildford, a town some 30 miles (50 kilometres) southwest of London.After finishing school in the area, he enrolled at the University of Kent in Canterbury, where he read English and Philosophy.The author, who plays the piano and guitar, has said his first ambition was to become a rock star, but he drifted into writing instead.""This sounds very blase.... but (writing) wasn't necessarily what I wanted to do,"" he told the FT in the same 1995 interview. Indeed, Ishiguro worked in several professions before settling on writing, including as a grouse-beater for the Queen Mother at Balmoral and as a social worker in Glasgow and London. His writing career finally launched during a creative break from social work.Ishiguro had enrolled in an MA course in creative writing at the University of East Anglia where his potential was spotted by the publisher Faber, which signed him.He began writing full-time in 1982, enjoying sustained critical and commercial success ever since.The Nobel winner revealed on Thursday he is in discussions to continue harnessing his Japanese roots in a perhaps unexpected way: by writing a graphic novel.""This is a new thing for me and reconnects me to my Japanese childhood of reading manga,"" he said."
1004,"WASHINGTON: Challengers to President Donald Trump’s travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries on Thursday urged the US Supreme Court to decide the policy’s legality even though it has been replaced with a revised plan.In separate letters to the court, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the state of Hawaii said the justices should still hear the case, which had been scheduled for arguments next week but was taken off their calendar after the administration announced the reworked ban last month.The challengers — characterizing the new ban as an indefinite extension of the previous one — said individuals who sued have an interest in the expired measure being declared unlawful because they continue to be harmed by the new policy.Hawaii also told the court in a separate letter that it intended to challenge Trump’s latest travel ban by seeking on Friday to amend its existing lawsuit against the previous one.The Justice Department urged the justices not to hear the case, to throw out earlier lower court rulings that had invalidated the ban, and to order that the legal challenges be dismissed.Trump’s three successive moves to block entry into the United States by people from several predominantly Muslim countries have been among his most contentious acts since taking office in January. Trump had promised as a candidate “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States”.The ACLU told the court that the plaintiffs who sued to stop the policy “retain an all-too-real stake in the outcome of the case” even though the original 90-day travel ban on people from six countries expired on September 24.That order was signed by Trump in March and was enacted with some changes in June with the high court’s blessing.The justices on September 25 asked all the parties to file court papers expressing views on whether the case was moot, meaning there was nothing left to decide because the temporary ban expired.That ban had targeted people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan.The new open-ended ban announced in a presidential proclamation on September 24 removed Sudan from the list and blocked people from Chad and North Korea and certain government officials from Venezuela from entering the United States.Among the issues raised by the challengers is whether the ban discriminated against Muslims in violation of the US Constitution’s prohibition on the government favouring or disfavoring a particular religion.A separate 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States that was part of Trump’s March order expires on October 24.Hawaii’s lawyers said that even if the high court decided not to issue a ruling, it should still leave the lower court decisions in place. To do otherwise would allow the administration to effectively win the case by erasing rulings that had gone against Trump, Hawaii argued.The Justice Department said that it wants the lower court rulings tossed because the challengers will otherwise cite them in new litigation against Trump’s reworked ban.“The lower courts should be considering challenges to the proclamation anew based on its text, operation, and findings,” Justice Department lawyers wrote.The weekly behind-closed-doors meeting — in which the justices consider next steps in the cases before them — is scheduled for Friday morning. The court could make an announcement at any time.The new ban could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors to the United States. Opponents have said that like the earlier two orders from January and March, it was still effectively a “Muslim ban.”Even if the Supreme Court dismissed the older case, it may still have to weigh in on the issue in the future. Various challengers have filed suit against the reworked ban, and those cases potentially could reach the high court."
1005,"Germany qualified for the World Cup in style on Thursday when superb early strikes from Sebastian Rudy and Sandro Wagner set them on the way to a 3-1 win in Northern Ireland that maintained their perfect record in Group C.Rudy fired a remarkable outswinging shot from long-range past Michael McGovern after two minutes and Wagner scored with another emphatic effort in the 21st as the world champions clocked up their ninth successive win to move on to 27 points.Joshua Kimmich added a third in the 86th minute as the hosts’ run of five successive wins was brought to an abrupt halt. Josh Maggenis scored a consolation in stoppage-time.Northern Ireland have 19 points from nine games and had already made sure of a two-top finish before the match. However, they are still not certain of finishing as one of the eight best runners-up up in the nine European groups.The group winners qualify directly for Russia along with four winners of the playoffs which involve the eight best runners-up.“I‘m satisfied. We scored and early goal and then controlled the game, like we wanted to,” said Germany coach Joachim Loew, whose side have scored 38 goals and conceded three in qualifying.Northern Ireland had won their first four home games in the group without conceding a goal but that record was quickly ended by Rudy’s thumping effort.The hosts, backed by a boisterous crowd, were repeatedly exposed and McGovern made a superb save at point-blank range to keep out a Sandro Wagner header three minutes later.Wagner headed against the post from Kimmich’s pinpoint cross before being rewarded with Germany’s second goal, collecting Thomas Mueller’s pass with his back to goal before turning and firing a left-foot shot past a shell-shocked McGovern.Germany goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen was tested once in the first half when he dived at the feet of Corry Evans after he got free in the area.“This was a bonus game for us, it could have gone to 4-0 or 5-0 but we kept out goal difference in a healthy state,” said Northern Ireland coach Michael O‘Neill. “It could easily have been obliterated.”The hosts put Germany under more pressure in the second half and the best chance fellow to Conor Washington who clipped the bar from an excellent position.Kimmich fired the third for Germany, although they were denied a clean sheet Maggenis’s goal, which left the home crowd celebrating as if their team had won."
1006,"WASHINGTON: Foreign minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday described as “hollow allegations” comments by senior US officials and lawmakers during his visit to Washington this week that questioned Pakistan's resolve in fighting militancy.While US officials have long been critical of the role Pakistan has played in Afghanistan, senior officials have been more pointed in recent days about Islamabad’s alleged support for militant groups.Earlier this week, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United States would try “one more time” to work with Pakistan in Afghanistan before US President Donald Trump would “take whatever steps are necessary” to change Pakistan’s behaviour.The top US military officer also commented on ties and linkages the Trump administration claims Pakistan has with extremist groups.“You want us to sniff them out, we will do that. You want us to take action against them, whatever action you propose, we will do that… (but) these hollow allegations are not acceptable,” Khawaja Asif told a group of reporters after his meetings with White House National Security Advisor HR McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday.Pakistan only victor in the war against terrorism, says foreign minister while speaking at USIPIn August, Trump outlined a new strategy for the war in Afghanistan, chastising Pakistan over its alleged support for Afghan militants.It was reported that possible Trump administration responses were being discussed including expanding US drone strikes and perhaps eventually downgrading Pakistan’s status as a major non-NATO ally.Asif singled out Senator John McCain — the chairman of the Senate Armed Service Committee — saying the senator was “playing to his constituents” when he criticized Pakistan.“We are not saying we are saints. Perhaps in the past, we made some mistakes. But since the last three, four years, we are wholeheartedly, single-mindedly, targeting these terrorists,” Asif said.Asif said that Pakistan had less influence over the Taliban than in previous years, which could impact any efforts for peace talks to bring an end to the war in Afghanistan.He added that US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would be visiting Pakistan later this month."
1007,"Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick to lead Poland to a 6-1 win in Armenia on Thursday which put them on the brink of clinching a World Cup place and made the prolific forward their all-time leading scorer.The Group E leaders swept aside eliminated Armenia with three goals in the opening 25 minutes before Lewandowski took his tally to 50 goals in 90 appearances, overhauling Wlodziemierz Lubanski’s previous record of 48.The Bayern Munich forward has also hit a remarkable 15 goals in nine games in the current qualifying campaign.Poland have 22 points from nine matches and need one more at home to Montenegro on Sunday to clinch their place in Russia.They could qualify later on Thursday if Montenegro and Denmark, level on 16 points from eight games, draw their match in Podgorica.Kamil Grosicki gave Poland a dream start by rolling the ball into the net from close range at the near post in the second minute after Lukasz Piszczek got to the byline and pulled it back.Lewandowski doubled their lead after 18 minutes when he curled a free kick over the wall and into the top corner after a foul on Piotr Zielinski.Seven minutes later, Poland were gifted an indirect free kick from eight metres after Armenia defender Taron Voskanyan passed the ball back to goalkeeper Grigor Meliksetyan who picked it up.Grosicki rolled the ball to Lewandowski who drilled his shot through a wall of defenders on the line to overhaul Lubanski’s record.Hovhannes Hambardzumyan rose to head in from a corner and pull one back for Armenia six minutes before halftime.But there was no stopping Poland and Jakub Blaszczykowski got on the scoresheet in the 57th minute, collecting the ball near the touchline before cutting inside and firing a low shot through Melitsetyan’s fingers.Lewandowski took advantage of poor marking to complete his hat-trick from close range seven minutes later before substitute Rafal Wolski completed the rout in the 89th minute, scoring from close range after the home defence got into another tangle."
1008,"WASHINGTON: When black rats invaded Lord Howe Island after the 1918 wreck of the steamship Makambo, they wiped out numerous native species on the small Australian isle in the Tasman Sea including a big, flightless insect that resembled a stick.But the Lord Howe Island stick insect, once declared extinct, still lives.Scientists said on Thursday DNA analysis of museum specimens of the bug and a similar-looking one from an inhospitable volcanic outcrop called Ball’s Pyramid 23 kilometres (14 miles) away confirmed they are the same species.The finding could help pave the way for its reintroduction in the coming years.“The Lord Howe Island stick insect has become emblematic of the fragility of island ecosystems. Unlike most stories involving extinction, this one gives us a unique second chance,” Alexander Mikheyev — an evolutionary biologist at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University in Japan — said.The glossy-black insect that grows up to six inches (15 cm) in length is nicknamed the “land lobster.” Other stick insects are found around the world, so named because their appearance lets them blend in with trees and bushes to evade predators.As adults, the wingless Lord Howe Island stick insects shelter in trees during daytime and come out at night to eat shrubbery. The bright-green babies are active during daytime.By about 1930, they had vanished on Lord Howe Island, which was thought to be their only home. There were no land-dwelling mammals there after the arrival of rats, who also vanquished five bird species and 12 other insect species.A rock-climbing ranger made a curious discovery in 2001 on Ball’s Pyramid: a similar-looking insect. Since then, captive breeding programs have begun at the Melbourne Zoo and elsewhere.Because of certain differences between the Ball’s Pyramid insects and the Lord Howe Island insect museum specimens, there was some question about whether they were the same species.“We found what everyone hoped to find, that despite some significant morphological differences, these are indeed the same species,” said Mikheyev, who led the research published in the journal Current Biology.Officials are planning a program to eradicate the invasive rats on Lord Howe Island, which could allow the stick insects to return.“I imagine that maybe a decade from now, people will travel to Lord Howe Island and take night walks, hoping to glimpse this insect,” Mikheyev said. “In maybe 20 years, they could become a ubiquitous sight.”"
1009,"WASHINGTON: Russian government-backed hackers stole highly classified US cyber secrets in 2015 from the National Security Agency (NSA) after a contractor put information on his home computer, two newspapers reported on Thursday.As reported first by The Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified sources, the theft included information on penetrating foreign computer networks and protecting against cyber attacks and is likely to be viewed as one of the most significant security breaches to date.In a later story, The Washington Post said the employee had worked at the NSA’s Tailored Access Operations unit for elite hackers before he was fired in 2015.The NSA declined to comment, citing agency policy “never to comment on our affiliates or personnel issues”.Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports.If confirmed, the hack would mark the latest in a series of breaches of classified data from the secretive intelligence agency, including the 2013 leaks of data on classified US surveillance programs by contractor Edward Snowden.Harold Martin — another contractor — is awaiting trial on charges that he took classified NSA material home. The Washington Post reported that Martin was not involved in the newly disclosed case.Republican US Senator Ben Sasse — a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee — said in a statement responding to the Journal report that, if true, the details were alarming.”The NSA needs to get its head out of the sand and solve its contractor problem,“ Sasse said. ”Russia is a clear adversary in cyberspace and we can’t afford these self-inflicted injuries.”Tensions are already high in Washington over US allegations of a surge in the hacking of American targets by Russians, including the targeting of state election agencies and the hacking of Democratic Party computers in a bid to sway the outcome of the 2016 presidential election in favour of Republican Donald Trump.Citing unidentified sources, both the Journal and the Post also reported that the contractor used antivirus software from Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, the company whose products were banned from US government networks last month because of suspicions they help the Kremlin conduct espionage.Kaspersky Lab has strongly denied those allegations.Russian government officials could have used flaws in Kaspersky software to hack into the machine in question, security experts told Reuters. They could also have intercepted traffic from the machine to Kaspersky computers.Kaspersky said in a statement on Thursday that it found itself caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight.“Kaspersky Lab has not been provided any evidence substantiating the company’s involvement in the alleged incident reported by the Wall Street Journal,” it said. “It is unfortunate that news coverage of unproven claims continue to perpetuate accusations about the company.”The Department of Homeland Security on September 13 banned Kaspersky products in federal networks, and the US Senate approved a bill to ban them from use by the federal government, citing concerns the company may be a pawn of the Kremlin and poses a national security risk.James Lewis — a cyber expert with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies — said the report of the breach sounded credible, though he did not have firsthand information on what had transpired.“The baffling parts are that he was able to get stuff out of the building and that he was using Kaspersky, despite where he worked,” Lewis said. He said that intelligence agencies have considered Kaspersky products to be a source of risk for years.Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen — who led calls in Congress to purge Kaspersky Lab products from government networks — on Thursday called on the Trump administration to declassify information about threats posed by Kaspersky Lab.“It’s a disservice to the public and our national security to continue withholding this information,” Shaheen said in a statement."
1010,"RIO DE JANEIRO: The Brazilian police on Thursday arrested the head of the national Olympics committee, who is accused of arranging more than $2 million (1.52 million pounds) in bribes to get the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to pick Rio de Janeiro as host of the 2016 games.Carlos Arthur Nuzman, 75, was taken into custody along with Leonardo Gryner, a former director of the national Olympics committee, the police said. Both men face allegations including corruption and money laundering.After police raided Nuzman’s home in September, they accused him of paying a $2 million bribe to the son of Lamine Diack, a former IOC member from Senegal. Both Diack and his son have denied the allegationsIn a news conference following Nuzman’s arrest, federal prosecutor Fabiana Schneider said the investigation had uncovered evidence Nuzman paid an additional $450,000 to $500,000 to secure the games.Marcelo Bretas, the federal judge who authorized the arrests, said the new evidence indicated that Nuzman’s role in the alleged vote-buying scheme was “more relevant” than previously thought.Nelio Machado, a lawyer for Nuzman, told reporters the vote-buying accusations were unfounded. The name of Gryner’s attorney was not immediately available.In an arrest order, Bretas said Nuzman’s wealth grew by 416 percent between 2006 and 2016 and that he had assets overseas that were only declared after the vote-buying investigation began. The assets include 16 kg in gold bars deposited in Switzerland, Bretas said.“While Olympic athletes fought for the dream of winning a gold medal, managers tucked away gold in Switzerland,” Schneider said.The IOC, which is conducting its own internal probe, said in a statement it would cooperate in the Brazilian investigation following news of Nuzman’s arrest.“Given the new facts, the IOC Ethics Commission may consider provisional measures while respecting Mr. Nuzman’s right to be heard,” the IOC said, without detailing the measures."
1011,"RIO DE JANEIRO: A Brazilian nursery school guard burned four toddlers and their teacher to death after spraying them with alcohol and setting them alight Thursday in an attack which horrified the nation.Dozens of people were also hurt in the blaze while the guard, who was reported to be mentally ill, died after succumbing to his own burn injuries.The tragedy occurred in a modest quarter of Janauba, a city of 70,000 about 600 kilometers (370 miles) north of Belo Horizonte city.Janauba´s mayor decreed seven days of mourning.""This morning, four children and a teacher burned to death when a guard at the nursery school sprayed alcohol on the victims and his own body before setting them alight,"" the prosecutor of Minas Gerais state, in the country´s southeast, said in a statement.About 50 people were hospitalised with injuries, said Bruno Ataide Santos, director of the local hospital.Their condition was not known.The guard, aged about 50, died in hospital several hours after the incident which left him ""with burns all over his body,"" Santos told AFP.About 80 children were in the nursery school when the attack occurred, prompting worried parents to converge on the site which they found reduced to ashes.""As the creche is near our house we heard noise and rushed over,"" Nelson de Jesus Silva, the father of one victim, told Globonews TV.""My little girl was so good, so smart,"" he said of his dead daughter Ana Clara Ferreira.Grief also struck Jane Kelly, the mother of little Juan Miguel Soares.""I was thinking of changing nursery schools because we are preparing to move. I woke him up early to bring him here and when I saw him again he was dead in the hospital,"" Kelly said between sobs.The dead children were aged four, the G1 news site reported.Police visited the home of the suspect and his family members to try to determine a motive.But police superintendent Renato Nunes told the website of the Hoje em Dia newspaper that the guard had ""mental problems"" since 2014.Officers found numerous bottles of alcohol at his home, Nunes added.The guard had worked for at least eight years at the nursery school where he was not directly in contact with the children.Janauba´s mayor Carlos Isaildon Mendes said an even greater tragedy was narrowly averted.""This could have been worse because the babies´ room was in the hall next door. Evacuation would have been more difficult. As the children were bigger a lot of them were able to escape,"" the mayor explained.Brazil´s President Michel Temer expressed his condolences via Twitter.""I am deeply saddened by this tragedy involving children in Janauba, and I want to express my solidarity with the families,"" Temer wrote.As the father of a school-age child, Temer said he understood ""this must be an extremely painful loss"" for the parents."
1012,"WASHINGTON: Congressional Republicans moved to hasten an overhaul of the US tax code on Thursday, while Federal Reserve officials warned in rare public remarks that President Donald Trump’s tax plan could lead to inflation and unsustainable federal debt.In a procedural step forward, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives approved by a 219-206 vote a fiscal 2018 spending blueprint to help advance an eventual tax bill.The blueprint contains a legislative tool that would let Republicans pass a tax bill by a simple majority vote in the Senate, where they hold 52 of 100 seats, allowing them to bypass Democrats.Separately, the Senate Budget Committee approved its own budget resolution and sent it to the full Senate for a vote, expected after October 16.Trump and top Republicans in Congress hope to enact a package of tax cuts for corporations, small businesses and individuals before January, pledging that sharply lower taxes will boost US economic growth, jobs and wages.Wall Street rose on the steps taken, with major market indexes rising to record high closes again on Thursday as investors warmed to the notion that a sweeping tax overhaul could be in place by the first quarter.""It sounds like they're serious about drafting tax reform legislation and that gives everyone greater confidence that this might actually happen,"" Phil Orlando — the chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York — said.Orlando predicted tax reform could lift economic growth and corporate earnings for 2019 and send the benchmark S&P 500 index above 3,000. The index on Thursday finished at 2,552.07.But Federal Reserve officials questioned the rosy Republican scenario, saying that proposed tax cuts could deliver a short-term growth surge but also bring high inflation, burdensome government debt levels, and an eventual return to sub-par economic growth.Unless targeted to raise productivity and underlying potential, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said a tax cut could feed “unsustainable” growth that would ultimately be undone by asset price bubbles, inflation, and possible recession.Fed officials generally refrain from commenting on fiscal policy.But the Trump administration is proposing up to $6 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts at a time when many economists feel the country does not need massive stimulus.The procedural actions in Congress set the stage for a possible clash among Republicans that could delay consideration of a bill.While the House budget prohibits tax reform from adding to the deficit, the Senate’s version would allow tax legislation to lose $1.5 trillion in revenue over a decade. Republicans claim tax reform would reduce the deficit in years beyond a decade.House and Senate Republicans must iron out their differences and approve the same budget resolution before it can provide Republicans with the legislative advantage requiring only a simple majority vote in the Senate known as reconciliation.The Fed's criticism was only the latest to hit the Republican plan.Democrats have assailed it as benefiting the wealthiest Americans while raising taxes on the middle class and cutting spending on social programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid healthcare programs for senior citizens, the poor and the disabled.Republican lawmakers are also questioning a proposal to help pay for tax cuts by eliminating popular tax deductions. Some Republican fiscal hawks have warned they will not back a tax reform package that adds to the deficit.The Trump tax plan would add about $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, said the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center — a Washington think tank — at a time when the national debt already exceeds $20 trillion.“Where is all that money coming from?” Representative John Yarmuth — the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee — asked on the House floor. “If you’re listening to this and you’re not a millionaire, probably from you.”In the Senate, Democrats sought to hamstring the Republican budget resolution with amendments that would prevent tax legislation from benefiting the wealthy, raising taxes on the middle class and adding to the deficit. But Republicans successfully turned aside the effort by voting the measures down.Democrats also called for an end to reconciliation, the legislative procedure that would sideline them in a Senate vote."

However, Chaudhry had claimed that he was restored by the Army chief.Mentioning the issue surrounding suggesting a name for National Accountability Bureau chairman, Shah explained that discussions are ongoing in the matter.“Will talk to all political parties in this regard,” he said, adding that there is no deadlock with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf regarding NAB chairman issue.He also said that he has met with PTI Leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who submitted him the names PTI has decided for the position of NAB chairman.Khursheed Shah said he and the prime minister will further consult on the matter with their respective party leaders“PTI has submitted many names. It is possible a name could come from the forefront from this list,” he remarked.“I will try my best to go with opposition’s decision.”The opposition leader claimed, “we will take the matter to Supreme Court if no consensus is reached.”Shah shared that his biggest accomplishment is saving the parliament from splitting. “Parliament was in the process of splitting when protests were going on in Islamabad.”""Nawaz Sharif had given all hopes,"" he remarked, adding Muttahida Qaumi Movement was supporting PPP at that time. "

1017,"SOHAG: Turn the clock back just over half a century and a contest between two men in the ancient Egyptian martial art of tahteeb could see the loser injured, or even killed.Today however, striking is no longer permitted in this form of stick-fighting, references to which were discovered written inside ancient Egyptian tombs.In the city of Sohag which lies on the banks of Nile in central Egypt, one martial arts school is working to keep the ancient sport alive.“Long ago, this game was violent, and about 60 or 70 years ago, it was similar to fighting games, because that was the era known as one of manhood,” said Sabry Mohamed, who founded the International Centre for Tahteeb in 2012.Tahteeb requires a great deal of skill and control, and there are rules which govern how to hold the stick and the kinds of blows permitted, some of which were aimed to be deadly before the martial art became a no-contact discipline.Sabry has set his sights on organizing international championships for the martial art.“We can make use of tahteeb by forming an international body that can organize international championships and we’ll benefit from this a great deal, monetarily, and also by spreading our culture and heritage to other people.”"
1018,"KARACHI: A 17-year-old high school student in Pakistan replicated a physics visualization, and developed results that surprised some older scientists, The News reported.Muhammad Shaheer Niazi, as per details revealed by international media, has replicated the phenomenon and presented his work like a professional scientist. The young student developed photographic evidence of charged ions creating the honeycomb, and published his work in the journal Royal Society Open Science on Wednesday.According to a New York Time’s report, an electric honeycomb behaves like a capacitor. In this case, the top electrode is a needle that delivers high voltage to the air just a few centimeters above a thin layer of oil on the other flat, grounded surface electrode.The thermal images puzzled Alberto T. Pérez Izquierdo, a physicist at the University of Seville in Spain. Neither Izquierdo nor others had previously explored temperature changes on the oil’s surface. Determining the heat’s origin is an interesting question that requires more study, he said, while praising Niazi’s experimental skill.“I think it’s outstanding for such a young scientist to reproduce these results,” Dr Izquierdo said.Niazi hopes to further explore the mathematics of the electric honeycomb, and in the future, dreams of earning a Nobel Prize in nature — and in the electric honeycomb — as he points out, “nothing wants to do excess work,” but he’s getting started early anyway."

A public exchange of recriminations and accusations followed.It seems like the matter is far from over yet.Referring to the media coverage of their spat a ""circus"", Hrithik wrote in a lengthy statement on social media, ""I don't see any grace in adding to this circus by testifying in defence of my character in a situation that I have no involvement in whatsoever.""His statement reads: ""I have been dragged into a dirty perverse mess without a choice in the matter. This is something that is not of my making. The truth is, I have never met the lady in question one-on-one in my entire life. Yes, we have worked together, but there has been no meeting in private.""""An alleged 7-year long, passionate affair between two high profile celebrities with no trail left behind. No evidence, no paparazzi pictures, no witnesses, not even a memento in possession like a selfie taken at the alleged engagement which is claimed to have happened in Paris in Jan 2014. Nothing that constitutes an exchange or any sort of proof of a romantic relationship. Yet we want to believe the other party because the rhetoric is - why would a girl lie?""He adds: ""My passport details show no travel outside the country in Jan 2014, which is the date that this alleged engagement supposedly took place. In Paris. The only so-called proof presented of this alleged “relationship”, was a photoshopped picture in the media. This was immediately exposed, the very next day by friends including my ex-wife.""""There are 3000 one-sided emails which either I have sent to myself or the woman in question has sent to me.

Towards that purpose, I have surrendered all my devices including laptops / phones etc which are still lying with the cyber cell , but the other party has refused to do so. The investigation hasn’t been closed.""He concludes it with: ""This is not, and I repeat, not a lovers spat. I humbly request people to stop labelling it as one and, for a second, try and see it for what it really is. I have been harassed by this for 4 years and the well meaning and probably necessary social bias toward women has deemed me helpless in defending myself.""In a recent interview, Hrithik's father Rakesh Roshan also spoke about the quarrel.“The complaint is now available in the public domain and that the facts of the case will shock you,"" Rakesh said.After Hrithik released his statement, Kangana's lawyer Rizwaan Siddiquee refuted a few things he had spoken about earlier including the lack of evidence of their alleged affair.He said: ""My client was dating Hrithik, who was a married man at that time. And the fact remains that Hrithik never allowed her to take any kind of pictures or keep any kind of data, which would suggest any kind of relationship, for a simple reason that he had to protect his image.""""Kangana has fully cooperated with the law and investigating agencies and Hrithik very well knew since May 2014 that Kangana’s emails were hacked and that he was personally accused of being the hacker. On what grounds did Hrithik go on receiving unverified emails from a hacked account and did not even bother to clear his name and image of being a hacker? He meticulously saved all these emails, which were fabricated and unreliable only to create a story for later use.""""Why has Hrithik always maintained that he was trying to protect Kangana all along?

The company is continuing to work closely with law enforcement.""The Yahoo breach was already believed to be the largest ever in terms of numbers of users affected. But a recently disclosed breach by credit agency Equifax is seen as potentially more damaging because of the sensitivity of the data leaked.Although Yahoo is no longer an independent company -- its financial holdings are in a separate company now called Altaba -- Verizon has continued to operate the Yahoo brand, including its email service and a variety of news and entertainment websites.Oath includes the Yahoo internet operations along with those of another former internet star, AOL.""Verizon is committed to the highest standards of accountability and transparency, and we proactively work to ensure the safety and security of our users and networks in an evolving landscape of online threats,"" said Chandra McMahon, the company´s chief information security officer.""Our investment in Yahoo is allowing that team to continue to take significant steps to enhance their security, as well as benefit from Verizon´s experience and resources.""Yahoo, which was once one of the leading internet firms, sold its main online operations to Verizon in a deal that closed in June for $4.48 billion.The purchase price was cut following revelations of two major data breaches at Yahoo.In addition to the 2013 breach, Yahoo said that hackers in 2014 stole personal data from more than 500 million of its user accounts.The US Justice Department charged two Russian intelligence operatives and a pair of hackers over one of the attacks, which had apparent twin goals of espionage and financial gain.Canadian authorities this year arrested Karim Baratov, 22, an immigrant from Kazakhstan, on a US warrant.US authorities allege Russian intelligence agents hired Baratov and another hacker to carry out attacks on Yahoo from 2014 to 2016.The attacks at Yahoo and Equifax have raised troubling questions about online security and data theft which may be used for fraud or espionage purposes.Earlier Tuesday, a White House cybersecurity aide said officials were looking at using new types of identifiers online which would eliminate the use of social security numbers, which were leaked in the Equifax incident.""I feel very strongly that the social security number has outlived its usefulness,"" Rob Joyce said.For years, social security numbers have been used by Americans to open bank accounts or establish their identity when applying for credit. But stolen social security numbers can be used by criminals to open bogus accounts or for other types of identity theft."

1026,"Indonesia's notorious traffic congestion was on display for the world Thursday after the country's president was forced to walk two kilometres through the scorching heat to attend a military parade.Graft-ridden Indonesia is home to one of Asia's most inefficient bureaucracies and gridlock plagues many of the archipelago's largest towns.The country's traffic nightmares were aptly illustrated when President Joko Widodo had to walk more than two kilometres to attend a ceremony marking the 72nd anniversary of the Indonesian military's founding.Widodo and senior government officials were held up by gridlock as they approached the military parade in Cilegon, a port city about two-and-a-half hours drive from the capital Jakarta, the presidential palace said.After a 30-minute wait, ""the president then decided from inside the car that he would walk,"" Widodo's guard Ili Dasili said in a statement.National police chief Tito Karnavian, who was also stuck in the jam, joined the president.Video footage shows the president walking with a phalanx of security personnel while spectators yell and chant his name.Widodo's unorthodox entrance wasn't lost on social media users, who questioned why the leader of Southeast Asia's largest economy was compelled to walk to the event.""How come the president walked for two kilometres to the military anniversary location, why didn't they give him the privilege of vacating the road or taking him in a helicopter?"" "

1028,"RAWALPINDI: Director-General Inter-Services Public Relation Major General Asif Ghafoor said on Thursday that there are no terrorist safe havens in Pakistan. ""There are no organised bases of any terrorist organisations in the country anymore.""""More than 50 per cent of Afghan territory is out of their control, which is also affecting Pakistan,"" said the DG ISPR while explaining that attacks in the country originate out of Afghanistan. Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor accepted that there are threats to Pakistan's borders, but added that the important question to ask is if the threat is by state or non-state actors. He added that Afghanistan has been at war for four decades and after 9/11 the war entered Pakistan. In regards to the issue of Rangers deployment at the accountability court on Monday, he said Rangers are under the Ministry of Interior.""Three wings of Rangers were deployed under Article 147. Once this happened, there is local coordination and this has been in practice since 2014,"" said Ghafoor.""A soldier who is deployed is doing his duty and if he is told not to allow irrelevant people....it is possible that someone who did not have a card was a relevant person. Even if the army chief does not have the necessary pass, he is informed by the personnel on duty that he is not allowed.""He added that the personnel performing their duty should be appreciated.""Any type of instability, whether political or economic, can not be in the country's interest and needs to be resolved."" Ghafoor said that the western border is being fenced while forts and posts have been built. ""The border will be further strengthened in the coming years,"" said DG ISPR.He explained that some of the troops deployed on the western border, which number around 200,000, have been rotated back to cantonments as the situation has improved significantly on the Pakistani side of the border. ""The border also extends to Iran and we are also improving border security there."" He stated that security operations conducted in the border regions are not against the people, state or the armed forces of Iran or Afghanistan, but are against non-state actors. ""Our border also meets Iran. It is important to mention that our deployment is not against Iran or Afghanistan but against non-state actors.""Ghafoor said Pakistan has ongoing coordination and contact with Tehran. ""The army chief will soon visit Iran to improve relations,"" he said.Referring to the eastern border with India, Maj Gen Ghafoor said the border is ""unsafe because of India's inappropriate reactions"".Talking about the increasing number of ceasefire violations by Indian forces, Ghafoor said the current year has witnessed the highest number of violations when compared to previous years. He added India has paid a price for firing incidents and will continue to do so if India does not act with restraint.""Threats from India are perpetual. We are a peaceful country and we do not want war with them, but we will defend ourselves fully and have the capability to do so.""""Unlike India, we cannot fire indiscriminately as there are Kashmiri brothers on the other side as well, so when there are casualties on that side, it is soldiers and infrastructure. But war is not the solution, so we are talking to them at all levels to stop this.""Referring to the ongoing Operation Raadul Fasaad, Maj Gen Ghafoor said it is being conducted successfully and intelligence based operations will continue in the country.""There was a huge security risk during Muharram. After many years, Muharram passed peacefully in Pakistan,"" said Ghafoor. Elaborating further, he said two suicide bombers, along with their handler, were arrested in Karachi and a car bomb was recovered from Quetta. He also spoke of a Bohra community gathering in Karachi which saw 21,000 foreigners participating, including 12,000 Indian citizens.""This event was also conducted successfully."" Referring to the World XI match and the cricket match in Miranshah, he said both were also conducted successfully and in the coming days, there would be a hockey match in Karachi. ""There were thousands of people watching the match in Miramshah and that would not have been possible if there were security threats.""During the press conference, Maj Gen Ghafoor said not a single country has faced the threats that faced Pakistan in 2008 and 2009.""There are no other countries like Pakistan, as all other countries who faced such problems either collapsed or had to have foreign armies take control. This is why you will hear the narrative that the Pakistan Army and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) are not in anyone's control,"" said DG ISPR while referring to recent media reports that ISI officials had ties to militant groups. ""The target of the hostile narrative is the power which stopped them, hence you will hear the narrative that the Pakistan Army and ISI are not in control.""Maj Gen Ghafoor said there are four hostile agencies planning to conduct terror activities in Pakistan, and the same has been shared with the Foreign Office. ""We have to take this war to its logical conclusion. If our resolve stays strong, then nothing can happen in Pakistan. Even now, we have intelligence about four agencies working against us."" He added that Pakistan has come a long way and the country is moving towards a peaceful Pakistan. ""ISAF could never have succeeded without us,"" said the army spokesman. The spokesman was asked why there was no press release following the special corps commanders conference recently held at GHQ, he said, ""Silence is also an expression"".Concluding his press conferen, Maj Gen Ghafoor read out a message from Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa: ""We, the Pakistanis, have travelled a long way amid threats and challenges. We have waded through the difficult times. We are moving towards our destiny which is a peaceful and prosperous Pakistan"".""While doing all this, we have contributed beyond our capacity to the regional and world peace. ISAF could never have defeated AQ without our support. We have done our part, shall continue to contribute and assist in their part for Afghanistan and beyond, but cannot take the blame for lack of doing elsewhere by others.""""As regards India, let it be known that no amount of threat or coercion can deter resolve of Pakistan. There can be differences within, that is part of life and its construct. It happens everywhere. But when it comes to external threat, let it be known that we all are one, irrespective of individual identity, cast, creed, language, religion, province or anything else and that is the spirit of Pakistan,"" added the message by the army chief. "
1029,"NEW YORK: Experimental icons Radiohead and rock-activists Rage Against the Machine were nominated Thursday for the first time to enter the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, vying in a field that includes singing legend Nina Simone.Two British acts who were major cultural forces in the 1980s — New Wave duo Eurythmics and the darkly emotive Kate Bush — were also in the running for the first time for spots in the shrine to rock culture, which will induct its latest class on April 14 in Cleveland.Radiohead and Rage Against the Machine received nominations in their first year of eligibility — 25 years after releasing their first recording — often a sign that chances of making the cut are good. Winners will be announced in December after voting by more than 900 artists, historians and others in the music industry, along with an online fan poll that accounts for one ballot.Radiohead emerged in the guitar-driven alternative scene of the early 1990s but helped reshape the direction of rock with 1997´s ""OK Computer"" and ""Kid A"" three years later. On the albums, the Oxford, England-based band led by Thom Yorke presciently sensed the growing power of the internet, embracing electronics in the music all the while warning of technology´s corrosive effects on society.Rage Against the Machine was a frontrunner in merging metal and hip-hop but became most identified with left-wing politics. With a punk spirit, Rage´s frontman Zack de la Rocha and guitarist Tom Morello have vociferously attacked US foreign policy and capitalism itself, while shedding an international spotlight on Mexico´s Zapatista insurgents.The nomination of Simone comes as the Hall of Fame gradually expands the definition of rock ´n´ roll. As Ice Cube said while being inducted with gangsta rap pioneers N.W.A. last year, rock is not a musical style but ""a spirit.""Simone, who died in 2003 in France, brought a classical sensibility to Gospel and jazz to become one of the 20th century´s defining singers. She was also a passionate advocate for racial equality, with civil rights songs such as ""Young, Gifted and Black.""She has enjoyed a renewed spotlight following a 2015 Netflix documentary, ""What Happened, Miss Simone?""Another late singer nominated for the first time was Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the Gospel singer of the 1930s and 1940s whose melodic voice and engaging stage presence influenced early rockers.Kate Bush in a later era also become a model for a generation of singers with the yelping cries of her dramatic soprano voice and an artistic approach that cared little about pop hits.Eurythmics, on the other hand, found worldwide success starting with the 1983 album ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of These)."" Singer Annie Lennox, who performed with producer David A. Stewart, has since been an outspoken advocate for human rights and global development.Also receiving their first nominations were three British bands -- blues rockers Dire Straits, R&B-influenced prog-rockers The Moody Blues and theatrical metalheads Judas Priest.Dire Straits — whose hits included ""Money for Nothing"" and ""Sultans of Swing"" — broke up in 1995, raising the prospect of a reunion if the band is inducted.The Hall of Fame could also bring back together the original lineup of Bon Jovi, one of 10 acts in the running that have been nominated before.Longtime Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, who quit in 2013, took to social media urging fans to vote for the arena-packing anthem rockers.Other acts in the running include The J. Geils Band, the feel-good rockers behind ""Centerfold"" whose namesake guitarist died in April, as well as Detroit punk forerunners MC5, British Invasion-era group The Zombies and late guitarist Link Wray, who popularized the three-fingered ""power chord"" so prevalent in metal.Depeche Mode, which has generated a string of synth-pop hits while maintaining an underground appeal, was nominated for a second straight year. Other nominees were rapper LL Cool J, New Wavers The Cars, Chaka Khan´s Chicago funk greats Rufus, and The Meters, the New Orleans funk band that backed up the late Allen Toussaint.One notable absence was disco titans Chic, who have been nominated a record 11 times without winning. But Chic´s main force, guitarist and producer Nile Rodgers, was inducted this year in a special category for his supporting role in music."
1030,"BERLIN: Postal workers in the western German town of Bad Hersfeld are getting a helping hand from a new colleague. A bright yellow, four-wheeled robot will carry mail and packages and follow them as they do their rounds.The scheme is being tried by German postal and logistics company Deutsche Post DHL, which says the custom-built “PostBOT” can carry loads of up to 150 kilograms and can navigate around obstacles.With the rise of online shopping, postal workers are having to handle ever-heavier packages.

IB memo stated Nawaz directed the authority to monitor activities of 37 legislators“I don’t believe in IB. I am not a child, I have been in politics for more than 50 years,” he said. ""The Prime Minister house should have immediately ordered an inquiry after receiving the report. If I am a terrorist, why I am a minister?""He demanded that Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister clarify whether the inquiry was initiated by PM House or not.Interrupting the minister’s speech, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq told Pirzada that while he was on a visit to Iraq, the Intelligence Bureau had filed a complaint to PEMRA that it the purported document was fake.“Come to my chamber tomorrow. I will call DG IB. This is a sub-judice matter,” the speaker directed Pirzada.Earlier, the federal government took notice of the memo and announced that it would file a case in Islamabad's Secretariat police station.The government also advised Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to take strict action against apparently mala fide reporting.The IB has also issued a formal denial of any such report or list. “Intelligence Bureau, premier national intelligence agency, is fully committed to safeguarding national interest and security of the country. Its officers/officials are working round the clock throughout the length and breadth of the country, facing all kinds of risks emerging in the line of duty,” a senior IB official had said on Sept 27, responding to a TV programme which alleged the agency had prepared a report regarding links of 37 parliamentarians with defunct sectarian and militant organizations.

The truth is that Pakistan is not just fighting but also winning against terrorism,"" he pointed out. ""Four years ago, Pakistan had one of the highest incidences of terrorism anywhere in the world. Pakistan responded to this tide of terrorism by building a strategic national consensus on a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy.""""Our troops have bravely soldiered in terrain that has deceived visitors for centuries.

""Kashmiris have faced all forms and manifestations of state-sponsored terrorism.""""The plight of Kashmiris in Indian occupied Kashmir cannot be ignored by the international community. As the time has passed the brutality of Indian security forces has increased and the civility of Indian occupation has diminished,"" he said. In the interest of peace, Pakistan can normalise relations with India, he said. However, ""normalisation requires that India stops its support to terrorism in Pakistan and agrees to hold unconditional dialogue on all matters of mutual concern including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir.""Khawaja Asif, who is currently visiting Washington for a three-day tour, met with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday. Addressing the media after the meeting, Tillerson remarked that Pakistan is critical for the long-term stability of South Asia.""Not just Afghanistan, but it is the importance of Pakistan and Pakistan's long-term stability as well,"" he remarked while speaking about US's policy towards South Asia.  ""We want Pakistan's government to be stable, peaceful.. many of the same issues they are struggling inside Pakistan are our issues.

It´s only a few meters from her Colombian cell to her unusually fragrant workplace, South America´s first gastronomic prison restaurant.Following the example of South Africa´s Pollsmoor Prison, where Nelson Mandela wound down his 27-year sentence, and another in Milan, inmates at the teeming women's prison in downtown Cartagena are getting a taste for reintegration back into society with an experience that mixes cuisine with customer service.The photo of the seven-year-old twins is Arleth's ""lucky charm"" -- a constant reminder of the future.Sentenced to six years for extortion in 2015, present-day life in the San Diego prison has become a little more palatable since she started working at the restaurant late last year.""Even though I'm still in prison, I feel free because it's a completely different environment,"" said the 26-year-old, wearing a pristine black t-shirt and apron, her hair gathered in a colorful pink turban. At least around the restaurant ""you don´t see so many bars"".Fifteen of the 150 inmates, most of them accused of murder or drug trafficking, work either in the kitchen, or in table service. The work is incentivised -- two days washing dishes, preparing or serving food, gets a day of prison time reduced.A fuchsia curtain separates the 50-seat restaurant from the cells. A mural of flowers painted by the inmates provides some colourful relief from the drab prison surroundings.Named ""El Interno,"" which roughly translates as ""The Intern,"" the eatery provides a little extra frisson for curious locals and tourists while they enjoy a 30-dollar menu that runs from ""fish ceviche in coconut milk"" to ""rice with seafood"" and ""posta Cartagenera"" -- meat in black sauce typical of the city.""When they arrive, people know that they are entering a prison and that they will be served by prisoners,"" said Johana Bahamon, a Colombian television actress whose Accion Interna (Internal Action) Foundation was the driving force behind the idea.""When they leave, they are happy to have met talented, courageous and real human beings,"" Bahamon told AFP.El Interno is a rare opportunity for inmates in a country that has the largest prison population in South America after Brazil.In the last 17 years, the number of those behind bars in Colombia has more than doubled from 51,500 to 119,000, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).Tougher sentences and an increase in convictions for drug trafficking have filled Colombia´s 138 prisons to well beyond their combined 80,000 capacity.Bahamon believes that women in these overcrowded prisons badly need to be offered a fresh start.It´s a recurring theme at the restaurant.""Yo creo en las segundas oportunidades"" (I believe in second chances) is emblazoned on Arleth´s black T-shirt and inscribed on the signs on the walls pointing to the colourful eatery.Bahamon said she was inspired by InGalera, a public restaurant run by Italian prisoners which set up in the parking lot of a Milan prison a few years ago.She convinced the authorities to adopt the concept to the San Diego prison, located right in the tourist heart of Cartagena, a few meters from the luxurious hotels that abound around the old Colonial city´s historic port.For well-to-do customers like Antonio Galan, from the capital Bogota, ""everything has a flavour and aroma of freedom, from the taste of the dishes to the ambience of the restaurant.""Thus, in the evenings at least, Arleth is surrounded by well-heeled influencers, personalities and media officials, who stand in solidarity with the cause.El Interno offers gourmet dinners from Tuesday to Sunday. But when it closes at 11:00 pm, it´s back to the mundane reality of answering roll call in their prison cells for Arleth and her fellow inmates.Like other prisons in Colombia, San Diego is overcrowded. Some 150 women, many of whom are awaiting trial, share a space designed for just 100.When she came to San Diego, Arleth said she got the shock of her life, as she had to come to terms with the prison drug abuse, poor hygiene, and a dilapidated building.For four months she slept on the floor, 25 to a cell. She was anxious for her children, entrusted to their grandmother. Their father, she says, mistreated and abandoned his family.But last year she passed her secondary school exams and trained as a waitress in the prison. Her work at the restaurant has earned her the right to a rare luxury here -- a bunk in a cell.In prison, ""only warriors"" survive, she said. "

1044,"MOSCOW: On a landmark visit to Russia, Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and President Vladimir Putin were set on Thursday to clinch a host of multi-billion-dollar energy and defence deals despite discord over the Syrian war.The first official trip to Russia by a Saudi monarch will also see the leaders of the world’s largest energy exporters discuss an extension of an OPEC agreement to cap oil output.""This is the first visit by a Saudi Arabian monarch in the history of our relations and that in itself is a landmark event,"" Putin said as he welcomed King Salman to Moscow in an ornate gilded Kremlin hall.""I’m sure your visit will boost the ties between our countries,"" he said. ""We aim to strengthen our relations in the interests of peace and security, in the interests of developing the world economy,"" the Saudi king responded.Citing Russia’s energy minister Alexander Novak, the Financial Times reported that Russia and Saudi Arabia were expected to sign deals worth over $3 billion (2.5 billion euros), including a $1 billion energy investment fund and a $1.1 billion agreement for Russia’s petrochemicals giant Sibur to build a plant in Saudi Arabia.Russia’s Kommersant business daily reported Putin and Salman were also due to discuss an arms deal worth more than $3 billion, to supply Riyadh with S-400 air defence systems.Russia and Saudi Arabia are heavily dependent on oil exports and the global plunge of the price of crude that began in 2014 lashed both their economies.OPEC members have joined with Russia and other countries in cutting crude output in a pact that has helped prop up prices.Putin said on Wednesday it was possible to extend an OPEC deal to cap oil output ""at least until the end of 2018"".The current agreement runs until March 2018.""We strive to continue the positive cooperation between our countries to achieve stability on world oil markets which promotes the growth of the world´s economy,"" Salman said in Moscow.The leaders held one-on-one talks, followed by broader discussions. Once they sign the expected deals, Putin will host a state dinner for Salman.""The political will of Moscow and Riyadh for deeper cooperation on the widest range of issues is clear,"" Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists ahead of the meetings.The 81-year-old Saudi monarch’s three-day visit got off to an awkward start on Wednesday evening after landing at Moscow’s Vnukovo-2 airport when the escalator he uses to descend from his plane malfunctioned.The escalator stopped midway, forcing the king to walk down himself, to be met by Russian officials including deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin and a military brass band.His delegation of around 1,000 people occupied all the available hotel rooms in five-star hotels around the Kremlin, including one entire hotel, state RIA Novosti news agency reported.Salman arrived in Moscow along with Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir and Minister of State Musaed al-Aiban.The head of Saudi’s state-owned oil giant Aramco Amin Nasser told Rossiya 24 state television ahead of the talks that the company would sign agreements with Russia’s Gazprom, Gazprom Neft and Sibur energy companies as well as with an affiliate of Lukoil.The Kremlin said ahead of the visit that Salman and Putin would also discuss the Middle East, ""especially focusing on conflict situations in the region.""While Russia and Saudi Arabia are partners on the oil market, they are at loggerheads on Syria, where Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad and Riyadh backs the opposition.They also diverge on Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been bombing Huthi rebels since 2015, drawing criticism from Moscow.Putin visited Riyadh in 2007 and last met Salman in Turkey in 2015. Salman said he last visited Russia in 2006, before becoming king."
1045,"LONDON: It was meant to be the speech that rescued Theresa May’s premiership, but her public humiliation before the assembled Conservative Party has thrust her own future into doubt.And, just as she tries to revive Brexit talks.May’s authority was already shattered by her botched bet on a June snap election that lost her party its majority in parliament just days before the opening of formal Brexit talks with the European Union.But her survival has been dependent on the absence of an obvious successor who could unite the split party around Brexit and fear of an election that many Conservatives think would let opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn into power.Comedian Lee Nelson, whose real name is Simon Brodkin, walked up to the stage and gave May the form“I don’t think anybody wants May to stay because they particularly want her as PM: I think lots of people want her to stay because the time is not yet right for what they want to happen next,” said Anand Menon, professor of European politics at King’s College London, who attended the party conference.""All they are talking about behind the scenes is whether she stays or goes, and that is a massive distraction as the UK faces this unprecedented challenge of Brexit."" (Graphics on 'Tracking the Brexit effect' - here)Even after the speech, there is no obvious successor because of rivalries and divisions. Those most often mentioned, however, are ministers Boris Johnson, foreign affairs; Philip Hammond, finance; Amber Rudd, interior; and David Davis, Brexit.But as Conservative lawmakers decide whether to proceed with May, Britain has just over one year to negotiate the terms of the EU divorce and the outlines of the future relationship. It is due to leave in late March 2019.If May stays, Brexit talks will be guided by one of the weakest leaders in recent British history. But if May goes, Britain would be thrust into another political crisis while the clock ticks down to Brexit.Many business leaders -- in Britain and the EU -- now fear a disorderly exit that would imperil Britain’s $2.5 trillion economy, shock global financial markets and undermine London’s position as the only financial centre to rival New York.“Yesterday was humiliating for May,” said one EU diplomat. “The whole country, the public mood in Britain is completely from a different planet. The whole island took off and is orbiting in their own galaxy. How can you turn this around?”In one of the most bizarre British political speeches in a generation, May speech to her annual conference was ruined by a comedian handing her a bogus employment termination letter “signed” rival Johnson, by repeated coughing fits and even by letters falling off the slogans on the set behind her.May battled on to finish the speech and was greeted by applause in the hall and a hug from her own husband, Philip, who bounded onto the stage to embrace her.Immediately after the speech, her spokesman said she was happy with the way it had gone. But the British media were less enthusiastic.“May on the final warning after speech shambles,” The Times front page headline said. The Guardian said: “Coughing and spluttering - May’s British dream turns into nightmare”, while the i said: “Last gasp”.The Sun, Britain’s most popular newspaper, compared the party to the 1970s television classic “Fawlty Towers” in which Monty Python star John Cleese plays Basil who runs a shambolic hotel while complaining about foreigners.“Like the sign outside Fawlty Towers, the missing letters behind Theresa May are an emblem of a tragicomic farce. Who needs Basil’s hotel? We now have the Tory Party,” The Sun said in an editorial.“This entire party has come unstuck.”Business minister Greg Clark said the Conservatives should stay cool-headed and praised May for showing guts and grace by coping with the interruptions to her speech. Spokesmen for both Downing Street and the Conservative Party declined to comment.Many Conservative activists fear another leadership contest will exacerbate the divide in the party over Europe, an issue which helped sink the last three Conservative prime ministers - David Cameron, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.And many worry that a leadership contest would pave the way for an election victory by Labour’s Corbyn, who they cast as a Marxist seeking to impose a socialist fantasy on Britain.While Johnson is popular with some activists, the leader of the left campaign in the 2016 referendum would not get the support of many Brexit opponents in the parliamentary party. Some lawmakers want a younger generation to take over but feel that no single candidate from their group is yet ready.One Conservative activist said there was a one in three chance of a leadership challenge by the end of the year. For a challenge, 48 Conservative lawmakers need to write to the chairman of the 1922 Committee asking for a confidence vote.The problem for May, the activist said on the condition of anonymity, was that the media will now focus on every slight mishap to cast her as a flawed leader.“I‘m finding it increasingly difficult to see a way forward at the moment and it worries me,” Conservative lawmaker Ed Vaizey told the BBC."

1051,"ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Law and Justice Barrister Zafarullah Khan on Tuesday said that better choices for the position of chairman of the National Accountability Bureau existed.Speaking on Geo News’ programme Capital Talk, the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) said that he personally didn’t agree with the choice but accepted it as his party’s decision.“I wouldn’t have voted for him [Justice (r) Javed Iqbal] had I been asked for my opinion...better candidates were available, and I would have proposed different names [for the position], but I have accepted my party’s decision,” he said. “However, I believe the said position’s power will soon be shared with a four-member commission.”Elaborating on an amendment to the NAB law, which will allow a four-member commission instead of chairman NAB to take decisions, Khan said that his party wants to remove ‘draconian clauses’ from the law that can be used as the basis of ‘a witch hunt.’“Concentrated power always brings with it, a high risk of abusing authority,” he asserted. “A draft is already being discussed by the parliamentary committee and we have reached a consensus on many things, save for one or two controversial clauses, so it won’t take too much time before the law is amended.”He added that a lot of work has already been done on the draft, and it would ""hopefully be approved soon"".Responding to a question about the chairman NAB’s appointment, Advocate Ahmed Awais said that he didn’t believe that the appointed candidate had an ‘upright character’ or a lot of ‘integrity.’Citing the March 9 suspension of the then chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Iftikhar Ahmed Chaudhry by former president Pervez Musharraf, Awais said that Iqbal had taken charge as the acting CJP on the same evening when Chaudhry was illegally from his position.“After the senior judiciary was sent packing on November 3, Iqbal took charge as the Chairman of the Press Council of Pakistan (PCP),” he said. “He violated his oath by taking the charge as he was unconstitutionally removed and later was restored as a Supreme Court judge.”Coming down hard on the chairman NAB, the advocate was at best a ‘manager’ and one who ‘suited both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the House.” He questioned the PML-N’s judgment ""even after Iqbal’s performance in the Abbottabad Commission and the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances"".Pakistan Peoples Party senior leader and member of the national assembly, Shazia Murree, refuted claims that Iqbal’s appointment was an underhand deal between the ruling party and the PPP.“Imran Khan has a habit of using the propaganda theory of underhand deals to keep his political career alive,” Murree said. “The appointment wasn’t the PPP’s decision alone; it was consultation and consensus.”  When the presidential reference against chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was filed on March 9, 2007, Iqbal served as the acting CJP until March 23, 2007.Iqbal refused to take oath on the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) on November 3, 2007. As a result, he was removed from the Supreme Court along with eleven other judges.Later he was appointed as the chairman of the Press Council of Pakistan (PCP) for three years on November 11, 2007. He announced on April 12, 2008 that he had resigned from that position. On March 17, 2009, as a result of the lawyer and civil society movement for restoration of judiciary, Justice Iqbal was restored as the member of the Supreme Court bench.The former Supreme Court judge will serve as NAB's chairman for a 'non-extendable' period of four yearsRetired Justice Iqbal was one of the judges of superior courts who took a fresh oath under (Retired) General Pervez Musharraf’s controversial Provisional Constitution Order in 1999, which in effect abrogated the country’s Constitution.Born in 1936, Justice Iqbal has headed two important commissions; the Abbottabad Commission formed to probe the preludes and causes of the US raid in Abbottabad in 2011 that led to the death of Osama bin Laden.He also headed the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances, constituted at the behest of the Supreme Court by the Interior Ministry."

1053,"MANCHESTER: Islamophobic attacks against mosques in Greater Manchester have risen dramatically post Manchester Arena attack, according to official figures released by Greater Manchester Police. Nine attacks on mosques were reported to police between March and June this year compared with none during the same period in 2016.Many Muslims living in Greater Manchester have reported to the police and other online organisations a rise in assaults, abuse and attacks on property in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester Arena attack.In one of such hate incited attacks last week, a pig’s head was hurled on the window of a Muslim family’s house in Oldham, when the family was watching television. Police confirmed it to be a hate crime.Official figures from GMP( Greater Manchester Police) show that there has also been a huge rise in the number of mosques being vandalised, attacked even when people were inside praying.Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Nasser Kurdy, 58, was stabbed in the back of the neck last month as he walked into a mosque in Hale, he was the prayer leader at the same mosque.Another one was a suspected arson attack on a mosque in July, Manchester Nasfat Islamic Centre, which was left damaged. Police has yet to arrest any culprits involved in the incident.has yet to arrest any culprits involved in the incident.Soon after the attack in May, the door of Jamia Qasmia Zahidia Islamic Centre in Oldham was set ablaze.The terror attack on Manchester Arena in May prompted a surge in Islamophobia attacks on Muslims and properties owned by people belonging to the faith, and even Mosques.Yousef Dar, a spokesperson for the Community Safety Forum, which works with the Greater Manchester Council of Mosques, while speaking to the local press, said the actual number of attacks on mosques was much higher. Incidents such as vandalism, graffiti-drawing and the posting of suspicious packages in an attempt to intimidate people at mosques have gone unreported.He said the suspected arson attack on the Nasfat Islamic Centre was the culmination of a series of incidents which had not been reported to the police.Commenting on the figures, GMP Sergeant Kathryn Crompton said: “Greater Manchester has a diverse population, and this is something we are very proud of and should be celebrated.“Discrimination of any kind is not acceptable, and we can’t stress enough about the importance of reporting any hate incident that occurs. It has such an impact on people lives and the wider community."" is not acceptable, and we can’t stress enough about the importance of reporting any hate incident that occurs. It has such an impact on people lives and the wider community.""He added hate crime is a priority for Greater Manchester Police and they continue to work alongside their partners to raise awareness of hate crime, how to report it, inform communities of the support that is available and bring offenders to justice.“There has been an increase of hate crime reporting across Greater Manchester, as well as nationally. We believe in part this is due to the greater awareness of the issue of hate crime.”Muslim Council of Britain says many attacks are simply not reported and the real figure is much higher – but they also point to the support they have received from other faith communities and from non-Muslims across the region."
1054,"KARACHI: Fawad Alam, one of Pakistan’s most deliberately ignored cricketers, has once again reminded Pakistan’s national selection committee of his existence with a century in country’s premier first class tournament, Quaid e Azam Trophy.On Tuesday, Fawad scored splendid century, 105 off 157 deliveries at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium where he was representing his department SSGC against Lahore Blues.The same day, Pakistan’s batting collapsed in Dubai against Sri Lanka and the country lost its first home series in ten years.Many hoped that Fawad Alam would be an automatic choice after retirement of Misbah ul Haq and Younis Khan, but it didn’t happen. Selectors ignored the mountain of runs piled by Alam and picked Haris Sohail instead, who hadn’t played first class cricket for three years along with Usman Salahuddin. There’s no doubt on Haris Sohail’s talent, not at all. Haris proved his selection correct as well. But, if a Test player had to be picked without playing first class cricket in the season, then what’s the need to make players work hard in already distorted domestic cricket set up? For chief selector Inzamam ul Haq, it seems, Fawad Alam isn’t a good batsman and that’s why Usman Salahuddin, Haris Sohail and his nephew Imam ul Haq were preferred. One wonder, if someone who is scoring runs with an average of over 56 in first class cricket isn’t good enough, then who else is? May be Inzamam can answer this.But to put some records, it is worth mentioning that Fawad Alam’s batting average 56.38 in 220 first class innings is third best among all the batsmen who have made their first class debuts in 2000s. Two players with better average than Fawad are India’s Pujara and Australia’s Smith. In last three seasons, Alam scored 2070 runs at the average of 59.14.Any player, with such amount of runs to his credit and yet not getting chances would surely have lost all hopes and hanged his boots. But, Fawad is defiant, says he will continue to fight for his place. “Yeah, it is disappointing, but what can I do?” Fawad said in an exclusive chat with Geo.tv on Tuesday. “My job is to score runs, I will continue doing that and will keep knocking selectors’ doors,” added the batsman who celebrated his 32nd birthday on Sunday. Fawad is disappointed, not demoralised. He is still hopeful for a chance. One can only hope that his performance in domestic cricket gets selectors’ attention soon.Otherwise, the curious case of Fawad Alam’s omission will leave a huge question mark on Pakistan cricket’s selection policy."
1055,"NEW YORK: The last Leonardo Da Vinci painting still in the hands of a private collector will go under the hammer next month in New York, the Christie's auction house said Tuesday, estimating its worth at $100 million.Dating from around 1500, ""Salvator Mundi"" -- which depicts Jesus Christ as the world´s saviour -- was long believed to be a copy of an original by the Italian master, until it was eventually certified as authentic.Fewer than 20 works by Da Vinci, whose art was already highly sought after during his lifetime, have survived to this day -- all of them held in museum or institutional collections, with the exception of ""Salvator Mundi.""As a general rule, very few pre-19th-century artworks remain in private ownership, and it is extremely rare for one of them to be offered at auction. ""For auction specialists, this is pretty much the Holy Grail, no pun intended, but it doesn´t really get better than that,"" said Loic Gouzer, co-chairman of Christie´s Americas post-war and contemporary art department.A third party guarantee has been arranged for the painting, which ensures it will sell for around the estimate of $100 million on November 15, said Francois de Poortere, head of the Christie´s old masters department in New York.The work will travel to Hong Kong, San Francisco and London, before spending three days on display in New York leading up to the sale.According to Poortere, ""Salvator Mundi"" -- which measures 45x65 cm (26x18 inches) -- was last sold to an unnamed European collector following a historic Da Vinci exhibition at London´s National Gallery in 2011-12.Mining a common theme, next month´s auction will begin with the sale of the massive ""Sixty Last Suppers"" by pop artist Andy Warhol -- which depicts Da Vinci's ""The Last Supper"" 60 times over, and is offered with a $50 million estimate. "

""But if he did that, I guess we´ll have to compare IQ tests.

I don´t believe in undercutting people.""But White House insiders said that Tillerson's refusal to directly deny an NBC News report that he labelled Trump a ""moron"" after a July meeting at the Pentagon, only fueled differences between the men.Since then White House chief of staff John Kelly has been struggling to keep a lid on the crisis -- an effort that has been consistently thwarted by Trump´s tweets and barbed remarks.After the reports Trump took to Twitter to publicly upbraid the former ExxonMobil CEO for ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea.The Twitter rebuke revived rumors that Tillerson is unhappy at his post, but he insists he has no intention of resigning.In Washington, Tillerson, along with Mattis, Kelly and chairman of the joint chiefs Joseph Dunford are increasingly seen as buffer around Trump that contains an impulsive president.Kelly has worked to control the flow of information that crosses Trump´s desk and imposed a decision-making structure that was absent in the early days of the administration.""The White House has become an adult day care center,"" Senator Bob Corker declared at the weekend, in an astonishing public rebuke from a Republican who campaigned for Trump and chairs the Senate foreign relations committee.Tillerson's departure would be a major blow to those hoping to temper Trump and stop what Corker described as ""the path to World War III.""And it could not come at a more sensitive time diplomatically. Trump is poised to confront Iran by questioning a major nuclear deal later this week and appears set on upping tensions with North Korea. Tillerson is also set to play a major role in preparing Trump´s monster trip to Asia next month, that will take in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.Still, it remains far from clear how long a secretary of state who has lost the ear of the president can remain in the post.""When Cabinet officials continue to work for a president with whom they have fundamental disagreements, nothing good ever really comes of it,"" Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University wrote this week."
1057,"Snap Inc’s Snapchat on Tuesday introduced “context cards”, a new feature that will allow users to book an Uber ride or reserve a seat at a restaurant without leaving the messaging app.The new feature is aimed at increasing the time a user spends on the app by providing contextual location-based search, potentially helping the company to get more advertising dollars.Snapchat, popular with young people for applying bunny faces or other filters to their pictures, competes for ad dollars with the likes of Facebook Inc’s Instagram.The new cards allow users viewing stories to swipe up and get relevant information about a business such as reviews, directions or contact information, the company said in a blog post. Similarly to Yelp, which allows users to search nearby businesses, Snap may be able to charge businesses to feature on cards, Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said.Initial partners include TripAdvisor, Foursquare, Michelin, OpenTable and Bookatable but the company has not disclosed how it plans to make money from the new feature."
1058,"ATHENS: A mental health emergency is unfolding in migrant camps on Greece’s islands, fueled by poor living conditions, neglect and violence, charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Tuesday.Medical staff have seen a sharp increase in people trying to get help after attempting suicide, harming themselves or suffering psychotic episodes, it said in a report.More than 13,000 migrants and refugees, mostly Syrians and Iraqis fleeing years of war, are living in five camps on Greek islands close to Turkey, government figures show.Four of those camps are holding two to three times as many people as they were designed for.“Every day our teams treat patients who tell us that they would prefer to have died in their country than be trapped here,” said Jayne Grimes, manager of MSF’s mental health activities on the island of Samos.The charity said six or seven new patients had visited its clinic on the nearby island of Lesbos each week over the summer following suicide attempts, self-harm or psychotic episodes, 50 percent more than the previous three months.Violence which many experienced on the journey or in Greece was one factor aggravating mental distress, MSF said.“I know I need to find hope, but when the night falls and I see where I am, I feel like I‘m going crazy,” it quoted a Syrian man as saying.The 25-year-old said he was haunted by the images of people dying of hunger in front of him in the long-besieged town of Madaya. “I still remember the taste of the leaves and the smell of death,” he said.On Samos, more than 3,000 people are crammed into facilities designed to hold 700, and about 400 live in the woods. In one Lesbos camp, about 1,500 people are in makeshift shelters or tents without flooring or heating, the U.N. refugee agency says.In August, MSF found nearly three-quarters of new mental health patients on Lesbos needed to be referred to a psychiatrist, up from just over a third in the nine months from October 2016 to June 2017.The report quoted a 41-year-old man, who said he had been tortured in a Syrian prison. When he visited a Lesbos hospital, he said he was told he would have to wait eight months to see a psychiatrist. “When I heard that, I felt like dying,” he said.A 29-year-old Syrian woman, on Lesbos with her family, told the MSF researchers the uncertainty over the future was “crushing us. It is killing us inside.”While the number of arrivals to Greece has slowed significantly since a European Union deal with Turkey to block the route in March last year, a recent sharp rise in arrivals has put pressure on government-run facilities."

1061,"BARCELONA: Catalan police tightened their protective ring around the region’s parliament on Tuesday where secessionists have pledged a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain despite warnings from Madrid of swift counter-measures.Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised fears of turmoil among European Union partner states.Catalan police armed with automatic rifles guarded Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella that houses the elegant 18th century parliament as it prepared to convene at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). About 20 armoured Catalan police vans blocked every entrance to the park and the entrance to parliament itself was guarded by three armoured vans and officers wearing balaclavas.Spanish national police, denounced by separatists for their use of force to hinder the region’s Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen. However, the Spanish government was reinforcing security at airports and rail stations in Catalonia.Pro-independence activists were gathering around the parliament, where big screens had been set up for them to watch proceedings. Farmers parked half a dozen tractors near the assembly, flying the separatist Catalan flag.A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw a crackdown from Madrid, possibly including suspension of Catalonia’s autonomous government.Both Spain’s government and European Council President Donald Tusk appealed to Puigdemont not to proclaim independence.“I ask you to respect, in your intentions, the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible. Diversity should not, and need not, lead to conflict, whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for the whole of Europe,” Tusk said in a speech in Brussels.The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted on Oct. 1 backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of statehood stayed at home.The Spanish government appealed to Puigdemont to reflect and not to take an irrevocable step by declaring independence.“I want to ask Mr. Puigdemont not to do anything irreversible, not to take a path of no return, not to carry out any unilateral declaration of independence and to return to legality,” Madrid government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told reporters.French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU should not play a mediating role in the Catalonia crisis, expressing confidence in Madrid’s ability to handle the situation.The Catalan parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbour.Supporters of independence were already congregating near the parliament hours before a pro-independence rally called for 6 p.m. to coincide with Puigdemont’s speech to the assembly.“We’re very excited, it’s another historic day and we’re hoping they will declare independence,” said Laura Moreno, a 21-year-old literature student, sitting wrapped in a Catalan flag near the parliament.If independence is not declared, she said, “the fight will go on and we’ll try again ... If it doesn’t happen now, it will in the future.”Aitor Llado, 30, walking near the Catalan parliament carrying a Catalan separatist flag, also said it was an historic day. “Today is the day they are going to declare independence and we hope to leave Spain because it’s an oppressor country.”The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city centre.That rally occurred a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly that called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted “yes” on Oct. 1.Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain. Or, he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral independence proclamation.Spanish ruling party lawmakers said Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called “nuclear option”.The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence."

""Those were tough times for everyone but we learn a lot of things from that India series as a team and as individuals.""""The main thing is our attitude and it makes a lot of difference so everyone put their heart and soul in the practices, so when they come to the match they did well.""Pakistan were in with a chance of an upset victory when they resumed at 198-5 with Asad Shafiq and Sarfraz Ahmed knitting a fighting sixth wicket stand, needing a further 119 runs.But off-spinner Dilruwan Perera broke the 173-run stand by dismissing Ahmed for 68 while Shafiq fell for 112, ending Pakistan´s innings at 248 for a 68-run victory.The defeat is Pakistan's first in ten series in the United Arab Emirates, their adopted home since 2009 terror attacks on the Sri Lankan team, which suspended international cricket back home.The defeat allowed Sri Lanka to replace Pakistan at number six in Test rankings, pushing their opponents to seventh.Perera finished with 5-98, his fifth five wicket haul, a performance Chandimal said was also praiseworthy.""We knew Dilruwan was struggling in the Indian series.

""We made many mistakes in the series but this was my first series as captain and it was pretty tough and will allow us to learn.""Pakistan captain justified the decision of not playing with two spinners in the series.""You could say we should have played with two spinners here but the bigger problems we got was of batting.

1071,"ISLAMABAD: The counsel of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) Jahangir Tareen, Sikandar Bashir Mohmand, on Tuesday failed to submit the lease record of agriculture land owned by the leader, citing a shortage of time as the reason.He informed the bench that 18,500 acres were acquired by his client in 2010 on lease. The counsel further said Tareen grows sugar, mangos, and cotton on his farms and then set up a sugar mill in 2002.Mohmand added that the PTI leader has been an agriculturalist since 1978.A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, is hearing the petition filed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Hanif Abbasi seeking the disqualification of Tareen and PTI Chairman Imran Khan for non-disclosure of his assets and ownership of offshore companies.The chief justice remarked that the lease agreements are not registered and fail to mention where and how much the land in question is. ""You need to satisfy us that the person from whom land was taken on lease was the owner of the land. We want to see the record of the revenue department first, as only that will tell the situation on the ground,"" the chief justice observed. Justice Umar Ata Bandial observed that suspicion is arising that the land may have been procured in someone else’s name. At the last hearing on October 5, the bench, while observing discrepancies in Tareen's assets, had sought the record of the 18,564 acres of land.Privatisation Minister Daniyal Aziz, speaking to the media outside the court, said Jahangir Tareen has admitted his wrongdoings in front of the Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. Meanwhile, State Interior Minister Tallal Chaudhry said Tareen and Imran Khan are already disqualified MNAs, what's left is just a court stamp on their disqualification. Addressing the media afterwards, PTI Spokesman Fawad Chaudhry said the cases against Tareen will go into the trash bin. "
1072,"JERUSALEM: Israel is to advance plans for nearly 4,000 settler homes in the occupied West Bank as part of a push to greatly boost settlement growth, an Israeli official said Tuesday.The approvals are to include units in the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron for the first time in years.The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that ""3,736 housing units will be approved at different stages of planning and construction"".He did not give a timeframe or a precise breakdown but said the homes would be located throughout the West Bank, including in Hebron and at the Migron and Beit El settlements near Ramallah.""In total, about 12,000 housing units will be approved in 2017, at various stages of planning and construction, four times the number in 2016,"" the official said.Israel faced heavy criticism of settlement construction from US president Barack Obama´s administration, but that has not been the case with his successor Donald Trump.Israeli media say that a planning council is expected to meet next week to approve at least some of the plans.Haaretz daily said that if the Hebron housing is approved it would be the first time for the southern West Bank city since 2002.Hebron is home to around 200,000 Palestinians, with about 800 settlers living under Israeli army protection in several heavily fortified compounds in the heart of the city.The 1994 massacre of 29 Muslim worshippers in Hebron by Israeli-American Baruch Goldstein led to an agreement three years later giving the Palestinian Authority control over 80 per cent of the city.The settlers and about 30,000 Palestinians living adjacent to them fall under Israeli military rule.Last month, Israel gave the settlers there the authority to manage their own municipal affairs in what critics denounced as reminiscent of ""apartheid"".About 430,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.6 million Palestinians in the West Bank, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War.Settlement building in the occupied West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem is considered illegal under international law.It is also seen as a major obstacle to peace as the settlements are built on land the Palestinians see as part of their future state.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu´s right-wing coalition government leans heavily on settlers and their supporters to maintain its thin parliamentary majority. "

Not even for satellites"".""We've now been observing TC4 for two months, so we have very accurate position information on it, which in turn allows very precise calculations of its orbit,"" which will not cross that of Earth nor its satellites, he told AFP.As its name suggests, the object was first spotted five years ago when it called on Earth at about double Thursday's projected distance, before disappearing from view.It is 15 to 30 metres wide - about the size of the meteoroid that exploded in the atmosphere over Chelyabinsk in central Russia in 2013 with 30 times the kinetic energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.The resulting shockwave blew out the windows of nearly 5,000 buildings and injured more than 1,200 people.While the Chelyabinsk event caught everyone unawares, TC4 is one of thousands of space rocks whose whereabouts are known.Millions are not.On its 609-day loop around the Sun, TC4 will return to Earth in 2050 and 2079, according to Ruediger Jehn of the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object programme in the Netherlands.""We know today that it will also not hit the Earth in the year 2050, but the close flyby in 2050 might deflect the asteroid such that it could hit the Earth in the year 2079,"" he told AFP by email.With a one-in-750 chance of hitting the planet then, TC4 is listed at number 13 on the ""risk list"" of objects posing even the remotest impact risk.""We need to make very precise observations to be able to better predict the return in the year 2050,"" Jehn said.Flybys like this one are actually quite common - about three objects similar in size to TC4 graze past at a similar distance every year.What makes TC4 special is that it has been chosen to test the global asteroid pre-warning system, fed by a network of observatories, universities, and labs around the world.The asteroid's close approach will allow teams to evaluate how accurate they were in predicting its orbit and size while using telescopes to learn more about its composition.""For us, this is a test case,"" said Jehn's colleague Detlef Koschny. ""We are practicing for the real serious case.""Many scientists believe the Earth will once again be hit by a space rock of the size that wiped out the dinosaurs, though nobody knows when.And even if they become better at predicting a strike, there is very little to be done about it, for now.Futuristic projects mooted to deflect or destroy incoming space rocks have come to nought so far, and the only strategy would be to evacuate people in zones at risk.TC4 will make its closest approach to Earth just before 0541 GMT on Thursday, at a point south of Australia, according to ESA and NASA.It will not be visible to the naked eye nor with regular binoculars, ""but it can be seen in the night of 11-12 October until about 4.00 am from European observatories,"" Jehn said."

Zubair Khan claims that Salman threatened him that he would not be able to work in the industry anymore once he leaves the house. According to the complaint, Salman made statements like “I will make you my dog. Will see you after you leave the home.”So, we are giving you a heads up for a spoiler ahead, just in case you have still not watched the episode!It is not uncommon for Salman to lose his cool during the elimination weekend, and it was no different this time with Zubair in the first elimination weekend, Weekend Ka Vaar, that aired on October 9.Zubair’s frequent use of inappropriate language in the house, especially against women was apparently the reason behind Salman’s attitude and behaviour. The film star threatened people to not tick him off ‘as he could be dangerous.’The contestant, who claims to have a connection with Dawood Ibrahim’s family, left the show on Sunday morning due to health issues.Bigg Boss had called him in the confession room and he was later sent out with doctors. While Salman said that Zubair was recovering, it was only by the end of the show that he announced that the participant got evicted due to a lower number of votes in comparison to other nominations."

Furthermore, industrial waste from these industries contains heavy metals such as copper, chromium, and nickel.He was of the view that safe drinking water should be made available to the population and industries need to ensure proper disposal of solid and liquid waste.Industries should also ensure that the labour force working in their facilities are not exposed to harmful chemicals, he added.The media briefing session conducted by World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-Pakistan) under a project titled ‘International Labour and Environmental Standards Application in Pakistan’s Small and Medium Enterprises’.According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the six-year project, funded by the European Union, is jointly being implemented by the International Labour Organization(ILO) in Lahore, Karachi, Sialkot and Faisalabad.The project aims to implement international labour and environmental standards in Pakistan in order to improve the capacity of the public sector to implement multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and national environmental laws and standards in Pakistan.The project involves building the capacity of the textile and leather sector to adopt Smart Environmental Management Practices (SEMPs) in order to efficiently use water and energy resources and reduce the use of hazardous chemicals by 15 to20 percent.Further the project aims at contributing to improvement in industry based laws so that Pakistan’s export market can compete with international labour and environmental standards."

1080,"LONDON: Liverpool forward Sadio Mane could be out of action for up to six weeks after picking up a hamstring injury on international duty, the club said on Tuesday.A statement on the club's website said he was substituted just before the end of Senegal´s 2-0 World Cup qualifying win over the Cape Verde Islands on Saturday.""It has now been confirmed that he picked up an injury during that fixture that could keep him out of action for up to six weeks,"" the statement said.Mane's absence is a huge blow for Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp after the forward scored three goals in four Premier League appearances this season.The injury is especially badly timed for Klopp with Liverpool's bitter rivals Manchester United visiting Anfield on Saturday.Liverpool are already seven points behind United in the Premier League and can´t afford to drop points against Jose Mourinho´s in-form United.Sane's value to Liverpool has been immense since his move from Southampton in 2016, but he has struggled to stay fit.He scored 13 Premier League goals last season despite missing the whole of January due to the Africa Cup of Nations.Liverpool won just once in seven matches in all competitions during his time away with Senegal.Mane tore the meniscus in a knee during April's Merseyside derby against Everton which prematurely ended his season and required surgery.They coped better that time, with five wins, two draws and a defeat.Having worked hard to get back to fitness this term, Mane was sent off at Manchester City on September 9, resulting in a three-match ban.Since his debut in August 2016 Liverpool average 2.2 Premier League goals with Mane in the team, compared to 1.6 goals in his absence.Klopp has signed Mohamed Salah and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain since the end of last season to add more depth to his attacking options.Egypt winger Salah has scored six in 11 games this season, making him the club´s leading scorer, but former Arsenal midfielder Oxlade-Chamberlain has been less impressive so far."
1081,"The metropolis was recently racked by multiple knife attacks on women, leading to fear as the police continues to be baffled by the attacker’s identity.The media coverage of such issues is something to be discussed at length — especially as it is a tool which has the influence to impact minds.The attacks which started from September 25, were initially reported on a three to four kilometers stretch of Gulistan-e-Jauhar. The attacker then increased his area of activity, extending it to adjacent the neighbourhood of Gulshan-e-Iqbal.Geo News reporter Ahmer Rehman said the CCTV cameras are of such poor-quality that they do not aid in the investigation, for instance, the attacker’s face and number plate are extremely hard to figure out.Ahmer who actively partook in the coverage was of the opinion that police jumping to action was primarily due to the media’s extensive coverage of the incidents.SSP East Samiullah Soomro said the police are conducting overnight raids and people are quite cooperative as well.The police official, however, implored the public to not crank call regarding the attacker as it diverts the attention of police.Senior analyst Mazhar Abbas said that news should never be suppressed, although it should be borne in mind that journalism is done in public interest.Presentation and the extent of coverage are vital aspects in highlighting an issue, he said.Abbas was of the opinion that the media should have slightly underplayed the issue while giving an example that the image of an unknown man with a huge knife invokes terror.“If the attacker intends to terrorize then he gets successful in his intention due to the media hype,” said Mazhar Abbas.Bureau Chief Geo News Karachi Faheem Siddiqui strongly supported highlighting the issue. He said that if the media had not highlighted the issue then the police would not have been beefed up and it would have been downplayed.On a positive note, even though the attacker has evaded authorities till now, the graph of street crimes has visibly gone down.Anchor Asma Shirazi said that media coverage is of paramount importance and was of the opinion that the issue has been over sensationalised as Karachi is the hub of ratings.Another noteworthy point she raised was that words used by media such as ‘Chalawa’ etc are not even used in the dictionary and the visuals created over-hype and exacerbated the issue."
1082,"Last month, German chancellor, Angela Merkel, succeeded in retaining her post for an unprecedented fourth time. But her crown of victory has a few thorns this time.Although she won, Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party saw a startling reduction in its vote bank. The party got only 33 per cent of the casted votes - its lowest in decades. Even more damaging was the reason that the German elections made international headlines. For the first time, since the defeat of the Nazis in Germany, the right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party raked in 11 per cent of the votes and walked right into the parliament.The AfD is a party formed by university professors, who believe that Germany should not be apologetic about its past and should instead remember the country's World War II soldiers with pride. In its election campaign promise, it demanded the closure of borders, strict action against Muslims and had publicly allied itself with France's far-right National Front.So how did this fringe party become mainstream?Now that the official results are in, it seems that close to a million voters, who cast ballots in favour of the AfD were previously aligned with Merkel’s party. The right-wing leaders also cut into the vote bank of the Social Democratic Party and the secular party, The Left. This may signify that voters’ confidence in traditional parties has been shaken.In previous elections, the Christian Democrat Party and the Social Democrat Party would pull in a total of 80 per cent of the votes, combined. While this year the two parties together only got 53 per cent of the ballots.Post the Second World War, whenever Germany’s economic woes became evident, left leaning parties always benefited. But this time, it seems they are drifting towards the right and their blinkered agendas. It would be prudent to remember here that the beneficiary of Germany’s economic crisis of the 1930s was Hitler’s Nazi Party.Earlier this year when Emmanuel Macron won the French elections, political watchers breathe a collective sigh of relief, sanguine that extremist politics was on its way out. There was also hope that Macron and Merkel will steer the European Union out of trouble and economic and political reforms will be enacted.But the results of the German elections point to more problem looming on the horizon. With fewer seats this time, Merkel will be forced to form a coalition with the Green Party and the Liberal Free Democratic party, both of whom oppose Merkel bitterly on many issues, especially the European Union. Similarly, with the AfD present in the parliament, it will be difficult for Merkel to provide any relief to the economically hard-pressed countries such as Greece and Spain.Outside Germany, France is also battling its own right-wingers pushing to sit in the parliament. In Austria, the extremist Freedom Party will be part of the ruling coalition. While, Jobbik – Movement for a Better Hungary has become the second most popular party in its country. Even in socialist countries, including Sweden and Denmark, the right wing is becoming stronger by the day.For this uprising, the socialist democratic leaders are to blame. They suffer from intellectual sterility and lack new ideas to tackle old problems. If this trend continues then pretty soon right-wing parties will be ruling over Europe and sitting in the European Union. What would that mean for the rest of the world?Javed is a senior researcher at Geo News.Note: The views expressed in the article are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."

1084,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) is hearing the Punjab government’s appeal against an earlier order of the court directing the release of the Model Town tragedy inquiry report.Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh is heading a three-member bench hearing the government’s plea against the single bench’s earlier order.Presenting his arguments, the provincial government’s counsel, Khawaja Harris, said the single bench delivered its order without hearing the government’s side.He questioned the hearing of the writ petition by the single bench when a similar matter was already being heard by a full bench.The counsel for the victims, Azhar Siddique, said Harris is implicating the honourable high court in his arguments. At this, a verbal clash ensued between the two counsel, leading the court to admonish the petitioners’ counsel to let Harris complete his arguments and then speak.The Punjab government had filed an intra-court appeal against the September 21 decision of a single-bench ordering the release of the Model Town inquiry report, authored by LHC Justice Baqar Najafi. On September 21, Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi ordered the Punjab home secretary to make public the report, authored by LHC Justice Baqar Najafi, on the Model Town killings and provide a copy to the families of those killed and injured in the 2014 incident.The government in its appeal against the decision, challenged the jurisdiction of the single bench to give its decision on the report, on the grounds that as many as eight identical petitions on the same matter were already pending before a full bench.In the appeal, the government said it was neither asked by the single bench to file any reply nor was put on notice on the matter, adding that it was also not given any opportunity to explain its position on the case."
1085,"Heartburn sufferers who don’t feel better with standard treatment, but who have no detectable reflux, tend to have greater distress and worse quality of life, according to a new study.In contrast, symptoms in patients with confirmed gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that didn’t respond to acid-suppressing drugs were associated with reflux severity, Dr Rena Yadlapati of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora and her colleagues found.“Our results support the interplay between psychosocial factors and symptom generation for PPI non-responders with normal physiology,” the researchers write in American Journal of Gastroenterology.These results are important in understanding various types of PPI non-responders and formulating personalized management strategies, they add.As many as half of people with symptoms of reflux don’t get better with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), the researchers note. To better understand how patients who don’t respond to PPIs perceive their symptoms, they tested esophageal function in 192 patients who had persistent heartburn despite being on double-doses of the medications for at least eight weeks.Among the 125 patients who underwent testing while on PPIs, 58 percent were classified as having functional disease, meaning that testing found no evidence of esophageal dysfunction or reflux despite patients perceiving symptoms.Another 34 percent were diagnosed with GERD because acid levels and other tests did indicate dysfunction in addition to the reported symptoms. Nine percent had reflux hypersensitivity, meaning the esophagus is extra sensitive to even slight reflux.Among the 67 patients tested while off PPIs, 58 percent were found to have functional disease, 24 percent had GERD and 18 percent had reflux hypersensitivity.For people with functional disease but no GERD diagnosis, the more severe the perceived symptoms the greater was their distress and difficulty swallowing. Their quality of life was also worse. However, their symptoms did not track with the physiological data from diagnostic testing for GERD.In patients with confirmed GERD, symptom severity was tied to the number of reflux-associated symptoms and physiological measures of reflux, but it was not linked to psychosocial stressors or quality of life impairment.“These results underscore the importance of reassurance, psychosocial support, and coping mechanisms” when treating patients with functional heartburn, the researchers write.The findings also support the idea that functional heartburn and functional difficulty swallowing, known as dysphagia, “exist on the same reflux spectrum,” they add, so non-drug treatments for dysphagia such as eating upright and chewing carefully could be recommended.For patients with GERD that does not respond to PPI, the researchers write, “antireflux management strategies, such as increased acid suppression, reflux inhibition, and restoration of the antireflux barrier, are appropriate treatment considerations.”Dr Yadlapati was not available for an interview by press time."

Toss is very important in such conditions, said the captain who lost the toss twice.Pakistan staggered and collapsed following Shafiq's departureWhile praising the performance of middle-order batsman Asad Shafiq, who scored 112 in the second innings of the second match, he remarked that if any player would have performed like this in the first innings of either the first or second test then Pakistan would’ve won for sure. Pakistan lost the second test against Sri Lanka being played in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Tuesday when the team was dismissed for 248.This was Pakistan's first Test series loss in the UAE since the team started playing its home matches there.Sri Lanka won by 68 runs, clean sweeping the two-match series.

1094,"DUBAI: Pakistan lost to Sri Lanka by 68 runs in the second Test on the fifth and final day in Dubai on Tuesday. Sri Lanka won the two match series 2-0 and Pakistan suffered its first series loss since the team started playing its home matches in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Pakistan faltered chasing 317 and were bowled out for 248 in their second innings with Dilruwan Perera finishing with 5-98.Asad Shafiq fought hard during his 112-run knock -- his 11th Test hundred -- and together with his skipper Sarfraz Ahmed (68) added 173 for the sixth wicket.But once their partnership was broken Sri Lanka, having already won the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi, quickly closed in on the victory.This is Pakistan's first series defeat at their adopted home of United Arab Emirates (UAE) in seven years. They had won five of the previous nine, with four drawn.Pakistan were forced to play in the neutral venues of the UAE following the deadly terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009.This is also Pakistan's first home defeat since losing to South Africa 1-0 in 2007, a series held on their grounds, and only the second whitewash in their history.They previously suffered a 3-0 defeat against Australia, a series also played at neutral venues in Colombo and UAE in 2002.Shafiq was the ninth man out when he edged paceman Suranga Lakmal to slip where Kusal Mendis took a low diving catch to end all Pakistan's hopes of an upset win.Shafiq's 253-minute knock had 10 boundaries but he again failed to help Pakistan cross the line, just like his 137 in the lost cause against Australia at Brisbane last year.Pakistan had looked to the overnight partnership of Shafiq and Ahmed to guide them to the winning target after resuming at 198-5, needing another 119 for victory.Both Shafiq and Ahmed had lucky escapes but Perera finally broke the resistance when Ahmed was caught off a miscued sweep at deep fine leg by Nuwan Pradeep.Ahmed hit five boundaries during his 130-ball knock.Shafiq brought up his hundred with a paddled sweep single off Perera and was reprived on the same score when Dimuth Karunaratne dropped a low catch of the same bowler.Perera then completed his five-wicket haul when he trapped Mohammad Amir -- unable to bowl in the second innings with a shin injury -- leg before for four, bringing Sri Lanka within three wickets of victory.Yasir Shah was cleaned up by Rangana Herath while the victory was brought up when Herath had number 10 Wahab Riaz caught gleefully by skipper Dinesh Chandimal for one.Sri Lanka had gained a decisive 220-run lead by scoring 482 in the first innings on the back of Karunaratne's career best 196 and then bowled Pakistan out for 262.Resuming at 198-5 Pakistan lost Sarfraz Ahmed for 65 while Asad Shafiq scored 112 for his 11th Test century."
1095,"TOKYO: The International Monetary Fund Tuesday raised its growth forecast for Japan´s economy this year and next, but warned that a shrinking labour force and weak inflation will be a drag on the country´s prospects.The IMF said it now expects the world´s number three economy to post 1.5 percent GDP growth in 2017 and 0.7 percent next year, up from a July projection of 1.3 percent and 0.6 percent respectively.The fund cited a pickup in exports and stronger consumer spending for the upgraded outlook, after Japan´s economy grew 1.0 percent in 2016.""Stronger private consumption, investment, and external demand bolstered overall growth momentum in the first half of the year,"" it said in its latest World Economic Outlook.But the pace of expansion would weaken after this year as government stimulus fades, consumer spending moderates and a boost from investments linked to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is ""offset by higher imports and slower projected growth in foreign demand"", it added.The 2018 growth estimate factors in the likelihood of the Bank of Japan tightening its record monetary easing policy, the IMF said.Japan´s economy expanded in the April-June period, marking six straight quarters of gains in its longest winning streak for more than a decade.Business confidence is also at its highest in a decade, but the country is still grappling with low birthrates, a shrinking labour force and years of on-off deflation.The inflation rate is nowhere near the Bank of Japan´s 2.0-percent target, despite years of record monetary easing.The IMF said higher energy prices would boost prices this year.""But inflation rates are projected to remain below the Bank of Japan´s target throughout the forecast horizon,"" it added.The report repeated calls to bring more women into the workforce -- something Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to do -- with flexible work schedules and more daycare spots, while it also called on Tokyo to boost near-zero immigration.""In ageing societies, ensuring the affordability of elderly care is also crucial, given that, if care is too expensive, it would typically be the secondary earners in households -- typically women -- who shoulder the burden of unpaid work at home,"" the report said.Another key issue is a planned sales tax rise in 2019.Abe -- facing an election this month -- has said he would press on with the increase, even after the economy was pushed into a brief recession following a 2014 rise.""Japan should withdraw fiscal support very gradually, including through a gradual increase in the consumption tax rate over several years,"" the IMF report said.Japan´s national debt is now more than twice the size of its economy -- one of the world´s biggest -- as it wrestles with spiralling social welfare costs."

Ebrahim as the Chief Election Commissioner on its advice.The leaders of the two parties mulled over the possibility of replacing Khursheed Shah with Shah Mehmood Qureshi“If the PTI wanted an opposition leader of its choice, they could have asked me, I would have fulfilled their desire; it was wrong to divide the opposition,” he said.MQM-P and PTI joined hands to change leader of the oppositionwhen heads of both parties met in Karachi.During the meeting, PTI’s Shah Mehmood Qureshi and MQM-P chief Farooq Sattar expressed dissatisfaction with Shah and agreed on consulting other parties in the opposition over the matter.In a statement on Thursday, Shah demanded that PTI should be open about their reasons for wanting to change the opposition leader.

1104,"ISLAMABAD: A senior Chinese diplomat on Friday admitted that removal of Nawaz Sharif as prime minister did cause difficulties in coordination for China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) but the projects on the ground remained unaffected.“Political stability is a must for economic development,” Lijian Zhao, Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) and Minister Counsellor at Chinese Embassy said in an exclusive interview with The News.He said after the removal of Nawaz Sharif in late July, the post of the planning minister remained vacant for about two months and there were some difficulties in coordination between the two countries for CPEC-related issues but now the situation has improved after the appointment of Ahsan Iqbal as planning minister again, earlier this month. “It will not be correct to say CPEC was not affected at all by the change of the prime minister. However to say it was affected grossly will also be a wrong statement as projects on grounds remained unaffected,” the diplomat said while answering question about the impact of Nawaz removal on CPEC.He, however, clarified that Nawaz Sharif might have been removed but his party was still in the government which showed stability of the system. Lijian Zhao said the two countries had resumed normal coordination and 50th review meeting of CPEC projects was held last week which was attended by senior officials of all related Pakistani ministries from the Centre and provinces and also by Chinese companies and embassy officials.To another question, the Chinese diplomat said so far not a single incident of corruption had been observed in projects being carried out under CPEC. Lijian Zhao said his country was closely monitoring CPEC projects to ensure they were graft free and current Chinese leadership was very strict regarding corruption.Misinformation about “mega corruption” scam worth Rs1.8 billion in Multan Metro project was spread last month by some quarters but later it was revealed that the company mentioned in the fake scam had nothing to do with the project and it did not earn a penny from Pakistan.In fact, a thorough probe by Chinese regulatory authority revealed that Jiangsu Yabaite Technology Co Ltd, a listed company in China wrongly used name of Pakistan and some other countries to manipulate its stocks in China. “Yabaite lied about investment and profits in many countries to artificially raise its share prices in China for which it was probed and punished by the Chinese counterpart of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP),” the diplomat said.The diplomat said CPEC offers a win-win solution for both Pakistan and China.“Two major bottlenecks in Pakistan’s economic prosperity are energy shortage and lack of infrastructure and CPEC addresses both of them paving the way for a brighter future for the country. On the other hand for Beijing, CPEC offers regional connectivity and legitimate profit for Chinese investment companies,” Lijian Zhao said.He said before CPEC there was up to 12-hour loadshedding in Pakistan which had reduced to a couple of hours now and would soon be completely over. “After a few years Pakistan will face a different problem; how to deal with surplus energy? The country will be able to choose its option to sell extra electricity,” he said joyfully.In addition there will be at least 60,000 jobs directly related to CPEC while countless other jobs will be created as a result of economic activity generated by the corridor, said the diplomat.He lamented misinformation about CPEC projects spread by vested interests. “Let’s be clear CPEC is not a gift or assistance. It has two major components, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Soft loans.”Firstly, he said, energy projects were being carried out by Chinese companies as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under which power plants would be set up with hydro, solar and wind energy. Secondly, government to government soft-loans would be given for infrastructure projects like Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5), Lahore Orange Line Train and KKH-2 with just 2 percent interest rate.Some analysts, he said, were committing mathematical blunders by presenting wrong figures like 13 percent interest rate for Chinese projects. “These are totally fabricated figures motivated either by political agenda or vested interest”. For projects under soft loans worth about $6 billion the interest rate is 2 percent while for FDI the interest rate is 6 percent.He said the Chinese investment companies carrying out CPEC projects had obtained loans from Chinese banks. “They are the one which will return the loan and pay the interest back to Chinese banks which means no Pakistani company or individual will be paying this FDI related interest rate,” he said asking what the concern of the analysts is raising question about interest rate when it is a matter between Chinese companies and Chinese banks.The diplomat hopes that the ties between the two countries will be further strengthened in future after the success of CPEC. He said China is also working to bring Pakistan and Afghanistan closer for peace and stability in the region and Chinese shuttle diplomacy is yielding positive results.“Soon there will be a high-level meeting attended by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Afghanistan and China and preparation for the same are underway,” he said."

1107,"Scientists in Austria and China made the first video call using quantum encryption, which is dubbed as “ impregnable” by experts.A statement issued by the Chinese Academy of Sciences said that its president, Chunli Bai, made a video call to his counterpart at the Austria Academy of Sciences in Vienna, Anton Zeilinger, in the “first real-world demonstration of intercontinental quantum communication”.As opposed to the conventional encryption methods, encryption through quantum networks uses quantum particles to transfer information from one point to another.Quantum channels send messages embedded in light, and experts say that attempts to disrupt or eavesdrop on them would create detectable disturbances in the system.The video call was done using a “sophisticated satellite, named Micius”, which is equipped with “a decoy-state QKD transmitter, an entangled-photon source, and a quantum teleportation receiver and analyser,” The Independent reported.China in early September set up its first “commercial” quantum network in its northern province of Shandong, state media said, the country’s latest step in advancing a technology expected to enable “hack proof” communications.China touted that it is at the forefront of developing quantum technology. In August it said it sent its first “unbreakable” quantum code from an experimental satellite to the Earth. The Pentagon had called the launch of that satellite a year earlier a “notable advance”.The country’s “first commercial quantum private communication network” was set up for exclusive use by more than 200 government and official users in Shandong’s provincial capital Jinan, the official Xinhua news agency said. “Hundreds of pieces of equipment connected by hundreds of kilometers of fiber optics were installed within five months,” Xinhua said.The network provides secure telephone and data communication services and is expected to be connected to a Beijing-Shanghai quantum network, the news agency said.Other countries, including the United States, have been working on their own quantum networks for years."

1112,"LOS ANGELES: Lucasfilm debuted its highly anticipated second trailer for ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" on Monday, hinting at dark times ahead for the Resistance and possibly even the end of Leia.The footage from the eighth installment in the blockbuster space opera, due for release on December 15, dropped during ESPN´s Monday Night Football halftime show. The 154-second clip follows a trailer released in April which teased Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teaching Rey the ways of the Force.This time around more plot was unveiled, with Luke telling Rey (Daisy Ridley) he´d only seen power like hers once before -- and while it didn´t scare him enough then, it does now. Fans speculated on social media that he could be talking about his nephew and Rey´s nemesis Kylo Ren, who is seen in a TIE fighter with his mother General Leia Organa in his sights, his eyes welling up as he prepares to open fire.Carrie Fisher -- who has played the character since she was known simply as Princess Leia in the original 1977-83 trilogy -- died in December, having already wrapped her scenes for ""The Last Jedi."" Lucasfilm chief Kathleen Kennedy has said Fisher will not appear in the as-yet untitled ninth episode, due for release in 2019 -- leading some observers to conclude that the new trailer was showing her final moments.Elsewhere Poe Dameron and Finn are shown battling the evil First Order and then there is a glimpse of Rey, apparently a prisoner of Supreme Leader Snoke, asking Kylo to ""show me my place in all this"" as -- shock, horror -- he offers her his hand.The marketing around the film has been controversial, with director Rian Johnson (""Looper,"" ""Brick"") recently warning fans via Twitter that those wanting to go into the theater ""clean"" should ""absolutely avoid"" watching the new clip.He appeared to have softened his stance by the time the footage dropped, however, tweeting: ""FORGET EVERYTHING I SAID AND WATCH IT WATCH IT WATCH IT.""It had almost half a million views and more than 21,000 comments on YouTube within two hours of being posted, with #TheLastJedi quickly becoming the top trending hashtag worldwide on Twitter. The reaction among critics was effusive, with Ryan Parker, a film writer for the The Hollywood Reporter, enthusing that he was ""blown away.""""I don´t think I have ever been so hyped for a ´Star Wars´ film than I am right now. It was the perfect mix of everything I was hoping it would be,"" he said. ""We got more Luke, but not too much, some looks at Leia that really hurt my heart and some more insight into where this all is going.""For Rolling Stone´s Sean Collins, the ""hints at a heel turn from Rey with those grim fourth-wall-breaking shots of Carrie Fisher´s warrior princess on the verge of death, at the hands of her own son no less"" presaged a movie strong in the dark side of the Force. ""The Last Jedi"" -- filmed on the west coast of Ireland and at Pinewood Studios near London -- sees the return of the characters introduced in 2015´s seventh installment.Introducing the cast at a fan event earlier this year Johnson unveiled a new star, Kelly Marie Tran, who plays Rose, a maintenance worker who is part of the Resistance.The actress revealed that she had told her family she was doing ""an indie movie in Canada"" -- such has been the secrecy surrounding the film.Hamill tweeted on Monday that he was racing home to watch the trailer but told fans he was ""not sure if I´ll make the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs!!!"" -- a reference to a famous line from the original ""Star Wars."""
1113,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday asked the lawyer of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan whether disgruntled PTI MNA Ayesha Gulalai has formally left the party.The ECP was hearing a reference against Gulalai filed by the party for defying its orders.“Did Ayesha Gulalai say she is leaving the party or has she left the party,” an ECP bench member asked Imran's lawyer.Imran’s lawyer, Sikander Mohmand, presented the transcripts of Gulalai’s press conferences and talk shows before the ECP bench, saying that Gulalai’s statements about leaving the party “mean she is leaving the party”.“As the party head, Imran Khan nominated Gulalai to the reserved seat. She has resigned from party membership,” Mohmand said.ECP adjourns hearing of reference against PTI MNA until October 4Mohmand added that Gulalai, in defiance of party policy, did not participate in the polling to elect the prime minister and was instead conducting press conferences at the time, to which the ECP asked if she was present in the session called by the party on July 29 to select its nomination for the PM. Mohmand informed the ECP that she was present in the meeting and that Imran had himself informed the party members of PTI’s nominee.Gulalai’s lawyer Barrister Masroor, meanwhile, said that there is stark difference between saying “I am leaving the party” and “I have resigned”. He said that the PTI MNA will continue playing her role in the party.Masroor also questioned whether the PTI chief was himself in the National Assembly during the PM vote. The ECP has adjourned the hearing until Wednesday (tomorrow).Gulalai announced to quit the party in early August after levelling allegations of harassment and corruption against the PTI chief.She was subsequently sent a notice by Imran Khan stating that she has defected from the party in terms of Article 63 A (1) of the Constitution.The notice, dated August 28, states that Gulalai on August 1 publically resigned from the party, did not vote for the party’s designated candidate in the prime minister’s elections on August 1.National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on August 31 sent a reference against Gulalai seeking to denotify from her seat to the ECP."

1121,"TOKYO: Election campaigning in Japan began in earnest on Tuesday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeking to repel an upstart new party that has pledged to rid the government of cronyism in a challenge to Abe’s near-five year hold on power.The Oct. 22 lower house election pits Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition against the less than one-month-old Party of Hope headed by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, a former LDP lawmaker often floated as a possible first female premier.Abe says he needs to renew his mandate to cope with a “national crisis” stemming from North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat and the demographic time-bomb of Japan’s fast-ageing population.The 63-year-old Abe called the poll amid opposition disarray and an uptick in approval ratings that had slid due to a series of scandals over suspected cronyism.But, the sudden emergence of Koike’s party, which also appeals to conservative voters, could upset Abe’s calculation. The main opposition Democratic Party imploded last month and a big chunk of its candidates are running on the Party of Hope ticket.In his first campaign speech Abe attacked the opposition for using populist slogans.“What creates our future is not a boom or slogan. It is policy that creates our future,” Abe said in Fukushima, northeast Japan. “We just cannot afford to lose.”The LDP-led coalition is defending a two-thirds “super majority” in parliament’s lower house, so losing its simple majority would be a major upset.Abe’s LDP had 288 seats in the lower house before it was dissolved for the election, while its junior partner the Komeito had 35. The total number of seats has been cut to 465 from 475.Recent opinion polls show the LDP in the lead and some analysts think Abe could still pull off another landslide victory.A soggy performance for the LDP, however, could stir calls from inside the party to replace Abe or deny him a third term as leader in September 2018, ending his chances of becoming Japan’s longest-serving premier.SHORTAGE OF HOPE?Koike, who defied the LDP last year to run for governor, calls her fledgling party a “reformist, conservative” group free from the fetters of vested interests -- an often popular campaign slogan in Japan.“We have a surplus of things in this country, but what we don’t have is hope for the future,” said Koike, 65, kicking off her campaign outside one of Tokyo’s major train stations.Koike has repeatedly said she won’t run for a seat which would make her eligible for the premiership and has declined to say whom her party would support for the post, leaving the door open to a variety of possible tie-ups including with Abe’s LDP.“The Party of Hope looks a lot like the LDP, but doesn’t have the same problem with vested interests,” said Koji Sasaya, 82, a U.S. resident and longtime LDP supporter who traveled to Japan to vote in the election for Koike’s new party.Others outside the station were less convinced by Koike’s talk of cleaner politics, while trusting Abe to safeguard national security.“I doubt she can deliver politics free from vested interests,” said Minori Hiramatsu, a 28-year-old mother of one who was on her way to a job interview.”Abe has problems domestically, but he is the best person to protect us from North Korean threats.”The Party of Hope echoes Abe’s LDP on security and diplomacy - it backs tough sanctions on North Korea and controversial security legislation enacted in 2015 to expand the military’s role overseas.Koike also agrees with Abe that Japan’s post-war, U.S.-drafted, pacifist constitution should be amended, though not necessarily on what changes are needed.On economic policies, Koike’s party has sought to differentiate itself by calling for an end to nuclear power by 2030 and a freeze on a sales tax hike planned for 2019.Abe wants to keep nuclear power as a key part of Japan’s energy mix, and raise the sales tax and spend more of the revenues on education and child care.A center-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed Democratic Party, is wooing voters dissatisfied with both conservative options."
1122,"Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s visit to Afghanistan on September 2 was yet another attempt by the two sides to stop further deterioration in ties. This was the first interaction at the highest level between the two neighbouring countries since May 31, when an explosives-laden truck in Kabul killed around 150 people and wounded 300. Soon after, the Afghan government alleged that the Haqqani network had planned the bombing at its safe havens in Pakistan. Islamabad rejected the allegation. The incident only deepened the mistrust that characterizes the uneasy relationship. One immediate outcome of General Bajwa’s visit to Kabul was the change in tone and attitude of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. He had been publicly showing hostility toward Pakistan for months and once even said that Afghanistan and Pakistan were not brotherly countries. But on the day of the visit, the statement issued by his office quoted him as saying that the two were friends, further adding that the visit by Pakistan’s top military and intelligence officials to Afghanistan marked a ‘new season’ in the relationship. The discussions during General Bajwa’s visit could possibly have something to do with Ghani’s changed attitude. However, it is still unclear whether any promises were made or agreement reached on contentious issues. That may be unlikely because the differences between the two sides are acute and certain disputes are old and almost intractable. Still, a new beginning could be made and the wish, jointly expressed by the two sides to forget the past and work hard for a better future, is meaningful. Ghani, it seems, is using the window of opportunity provided after US President Trump’s new Afghanistan and South Asia policy. The Afghan President knows that Pakistan is under pressure since Trump’s strong criticism of it allegedly harbouring terrorists. He may have calculated that Pakistan will now be willing to bring the Afghan Taliban leaders to the negotiations table or take action against them and the Haqqani network. Bajwa also took along with him Lt. Gen. Naveed Mukhtar, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) - an organization that the Afghan government habitually blames for almost every act of violence in Afghanistan by linking it with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. The Pakistan Army chief had a one-on-one meeting with the Afghan President before their aides joined them to discuss a host of issues, including security in the region, bilateral relations, peace and stability, anti-terror efforts and matters concerning business and transit trade. Dr. Omar Zakhilwal, the Afghan ambassador in Pakistan, who boasts of playing a role in facilitating Bajwa’s visit, termed the meeting between the two leaders as ‘constructive and encouraging.’ From the statements issued by the two sides in Kabul and Rawalpindi, it was obvious that Ghani had repeated his demand of Pakistan taking practical steps for enabling peace and stability to return to Afghanistan. He also wanted to set up task teams in different sectors to form a clear cooperation framework and establish a monitoring mechanism to make sure the two countries fulfill their promises. Bajwa, on the other hand, renewed Pakistan’s offer of intelligence sharing and training Afghan military officers. His predecessor, General (r) Raheel Sharif, had made similar propositions and even managed to oversee the signing of a memorandum of understanding for intelligence-sharing between the ISI and the Afghan intelligence agency, National Directorate of Security (NDS). But Kabul buckled under pressure by opponents of the deal, and failed to get it implemented. As for the training of Afghan military officers in Pakistan, Ghani despite domestic opposition sent six cadets to study at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Abbottabad, before halting the process. In comparison, about 1,100 Afghan military officers are being sent to India for training annually, much to Pakistan’s concern. While Bajwa’s visit to Kabul has raised expectations of a gradual improvement in Pak-Afghan relations, there is a realization that achieving a breakthrough won’t be easy. There is wide divergence of views between Islamabad and Kabul. For example, Pakistan considers India a spoiler and a destabilizing force. However, Afghanistan is convinced that India is a stabilizing force and is backing Trump’s call to New Delhi to play a bigger role in the war-ravaged country’s development. Bridging the gap would require overcoming the distrust that has plagued relations between Islamabad and Kabul. It would be worthwhile if the two countries can take steps to improve their relations bilaterally instead of being pressured and arm-twisted by the Trump administration to do its bidding. A recent Afghan special forces raid in Nangarhar province reportedly killing 7 Jamaatul-Ahraar fighters has come as a pleasant surprise to Pakistan’s military authorities as it is probably the second time that Kabul has targeted Pakistani militants based in Afghanistan. This augurs well for the future of Pak-Afghan relations, though Pakistan will like more such operations and Afghanistan in return will want similar action by Pakistani forces against Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network.Yusufzai is the Resident Editor of The News International in PeshawarNote: The views expressed in the article are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."

1125,"LONDON: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has warned that the only way to stop its nuclear deal from collapsing is for Europe to defy any US reimposition of sanctions.In an interview published Saturday by Britain's Guardian newspaper, Zarif said Iran would develop much more advanced nuclear technology - though not for weapons purposes - if Europe followed the United States in returning to a sanctions regime.""Europe should lead,"" he said during an interview in New York.The deal agreed in 2015 between Iran and six world powers - the United States, China, Russia, France, Britain and Germany - lifts economic sanctions put in place in 2005 in exchange for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for verifying that Iran meets the terms of the agreement.US President Donald Trump has attacked the deal on numerous occasions, vowing to tear it up.On October 15, Trump is due to testify to Congress whether Tehran is complying with the deal and whether it remains in the United States' interests to stick by it.If he decides it is not, it could open the way for US lawmakers to reimpose sanctions, leading to the potential collapse of the agreement.""I think he has made a policy of being unpredictable, and now he's turning that into being unreliable as well,"" Zarif said.""My assumption and guess is that he will not certify and then will allow Congress to take the decision.""He said that if the United States scuppers the deal, the decision would prove counter-productive.""The deal allowed Iran to continue its research and development. So we have improved our technological base,"" he said.""If we decide to walk away from the deal we would be walking away with better technology. It will always be peaceful... but we will not observe the limitations that were agreed on as part of the bargain.""Zarif said ""walking away"" was one of the options being considered by Tehran.""If Europe and Japan and Russia and China decided to go along with the United States, then I think that will be the end of the deal,"" he said.Washington on Thursday pressed for the IAEA to carry out more nuclear inspections in Iran, warning that failure to do so would make the nuclear deal with Tehran ""an empty promise""."

1127,"LONDON: Iran said on Tuesday that the United States would be “joining the terrorists’ camp” if it chose to designate its elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) a terrorist organisation.US President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week his final decision on how he wants to contain Iran’s regional influence. He is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp as a terrorist organization.“The world should be thankful to the Revolutionary Guards for its fight against terrorists, especially against Daesh (Islamic State),” Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference broadcast live on state television.“So by taking a stance against the Revolutionary Guards and designating it a terrorist group, the Americans would be joining the terrorists’ camp,” he added.Trump is expected to “decertify” a landmark 2015 deal Iran struck with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.Trump’s announcement would stop short of pulling out of the agreement but give Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.US sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group.IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday that if Washington designated the Guards a terrorist organization, they “will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Monday that Tehran would give a “firm, decisive and crushing” response if the United States goes ahead with such a plan."
1128,"The Oxford University, where Aung San Suu Kyi studied as an undergraduate, has removed her portrait from public display amid criticism of her handling of the Rohingya crisis.The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar has seen more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of the country, has been criticised for failing to address UN allegations of ethnic cleansing.The governing body of Oxford’s St Hugh’s college decided to remove the painting of the Nobel laureate from its main entrance, days before the start of the new term.St Hugh's College said her portrait had been replaced with a Japanese painting.The portrait, painted by the artist Chen Yanning in 1997, belonged to Suu Kyi’s husband, the Oxford academic Michael Aris. After his death in 1999, the portrait was bequeathed to St Hugh’s, and hung near the college’s main entrance.Myanmar's government, led by Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has rejected allegations of atrocities against the Rohingya, accusing the international media, NGOs and the UN of fabrications.In 2012, Suu Kyi was celebrated with an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, where she studied politics, philosophy and economics between 1964 and 1967.Suu Kyi, who won a Nobel peace prize in 1991, has been Myanmar's de facto civilian leader since winning elections in 2015. She has been facing growing international pressure to act, after evidence emerged that Myanmar’s military forces were driving hundreds of thousands of Rohingya out of the country."

1131,"Wall Street fell from record levels on Monday as gains in Microsoft and other technology stocks failed to offset a drop in General Electric and a slide in healthcare stocks.The S&P healthcare index moved 0.67 percent lower, weighed by a 3.61-percent slide in Medtronic after the medical device maker warned that its quarterly profit would be impacted after Hurricane Maria hit its operations in Puerto Rico.The S&P 500 has rallied 14 percent in 2017 and last week hit record highs, buoyed by strong company earnings and enthusiasm that President Donald Trump will cut corporate taxes.JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup will report profits on Thursday, kicking third-quarter corporate reporting season into high gear as investors look for strong growth to justify pricey valuations.“Unlike the restaurant chains, movie chains and homebuilders and some of the discretionary stocks hurt by the hurricanes, I don’t expect the banks to be affected by the non-recurring blips during the quarter,” Jake Dollarhide — the chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma — said.Overall, earnings at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 4.8 percent last quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, down from the double-digit growth recorded in the first two quarters of this year.GE shares sank 3.94 percent after the conglomerate named a new CFO and said it gave activist investment firm Trian Fund Management a board seat.Nvidia rose 2.26 percent and the S&P 500 information technology index added 0.24 percent, bringing its gain in 2017 to 28 percent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.06 percent to end at 22,761.07, while the S&P 500 lost 0.18 percent to 2,544.73.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.16 percent to 6,579.73.The CBOE Volatility index — Wall Street’s fear gauge — rose 0.77 points to 10.42, its highest in two weeks.Shares of cinema stocks AMC Entertainment Holdings and Regal Entertainment fell more than 4 percent after domestic opening weekend ticket sales for science fiction sequel Blade Runner 2049 fell short of expectations.Also weighing on the healthcare sector, Express Scripts lost 5 percent after Raymond James downgraded the stock to “underperform” from “market perform”.Tesla fell 3.91 percent after pushing back the unveiling of its big rig truck to mid-November.Viacom slipped 6.37 percent after Citigroup downgraded the stock to “sell”, citing risks that pay-TV firms would stop carrying its channels.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favoured decliners.About 4.4 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, well below the 6.1 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data."
1132,"HARARE: Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe moved Patrick Chinamasa from the finance ministry on Monday to lead a new cybersecurity ministry that will focus on crimes on social media and other websites ahead of an election due next year.Chinamasa will be replaced at the treasury by Home Affairs Minister Ignatius Chombo in a cabinet reshuffle that also diminished the role of Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa, seen as a potential successor to Mugabe.Chombo’s move — announced in a government statement — comes against the backdrop of a severe hard currency shortage that has dealt a fresh blow to confidence and investment in the southern African economy, which uses the US dollar.Chinamasa was appointed finance minister after Mugabe’s re-election in 2013 and his move to head the new Ministry of Cyber Security, Threat Detection, and Mitigation was unexpected.Its creation comes after Chinamasa said last month the government would now treat social media as a security threat after accusing users of spreading rumours about shortages of basic goods, which caused panic buying and price increases.The government has been uneasy with social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his #ThisFlag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade.Government critics took to Twitter deriding Chinamasa as new “minister of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp affairs”.Chinamasa — a lawyer by training — will also be responsible for bringing to parliament a long-awaited cybercrimes bill that criminalizes false information posted on the internet, cyber-bullying, and online activity against the government.Meanwhile, Chombo — who is a staunch Mugabe supporter with no finance background, coming from the 93-year-old leader’s rural home district — was the surprise pick for the minister of finance.He will have to contend with a serious shortage of foreign currency that has seen US dollar bank balances lose value against cash dollars, fanning a thriving black market.The worthless Zimbabwe dollar was replaced by the US dollar in 2009 but the economy has struggled over the past 18 months because of a massive domestic shortage of greenbacks.As a result, cash, especially crisp, new, $100 bills, has enjoyed a steady 10 percent to 20 percent premium over dollars stored electronically in bank accounts — nicknamed “Zollars” — meaning people have to transfer more than face value to the person selling the dollars on the black market.When Mugabe said on Saturday he was going to review the performance of his ministers, speculation was rife that Mnangagwa — who said last week he had been poisoned in August — would be among the casualties.Mnangagwa has come under attack from a ruling party faction that accuses him of seeking to force Mugabe to resign in his favour. The ZANU-PF is divided into two camps, one supporting Mnangagwa to succeed him and another rallying behind First Lady Grace Mugabe.Mnangagwa — who denies the accusations — lost oversight of the Justice Ministry to Zimbabwe’s spy agency head Happyton Bonyongwe.Bonyongwe — a retired army general who headed the national intelligence agency for 15 years — will be responsible for new legislation and will supervise the election due next year, including determining which foreign observers to invite.Mugabe — who has ruled the former British colony since independence in 1980 — has said he plans to run for another 5-year term next year, his last under the constitution when he will be 94.In total, 10 cabinet ministers changed posts while two were dropped entirely."
1133,"A spate of wildfires fanned by strong winds swept through northern California’s wine country on Monday, leaving at least 10 people dead, destroying hundreds of homes and businesses and chasing some 20,000 people from their dwellings.Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency for Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties, encompassing some of the state’s prime wine-making areas, as the blazes raged unchecked and engulfed the region in thick, billowing smoke that drifted south into the San Francisco Bay area.He later extended the declaration to include four more northern California counties and Orange County in Southern California.Sonoma County bore the brunt of the fatalities, with seven fire-related deaths confirmed there, according to the sheriff’s department. Two others died in Napa County and one more in Mendocino County, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire).Details on the circumstances of those deaths were not immediately available from either CalFire or local officials. But KGO-TV in San Francisco, citing unnamed California Highway Patrol officials, described one of the victims as a blind, elderly woman found dead in the driveway of her home in Santa Rosa, a town in Sonoma County.Two hospitals were forced to evacuate in Sonoma County, state officials said.Thousands of firefighters battled wind gusts in excess of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) that have rapidly spread 15 separate wildfires across some 73,000 acres in northern California since erupting late Sunday night, according to CalFire spokesman Daniel Berlant.About 1,500 homes and commercial buildings have been destroyed throughout the region, Ken Pimlott, director of CalFire, said at a news conference.A separate wildfire on Monday torched at least a half-dozen homes in the affluent Anaheim Hills neighborhood of Southern California’s Orange County, prompting evacuations there, authorities said.The cause of the fires have yet to be determined, officials said."

I need wickets so you have to do bombardment on the Lankans,"" Wahab quoted the skipper's instructions before handing over a bowl to the paceman.Riaz, who had taken three wickets on the third day of the Dubai Test, finished with 4-41 on the fourth day.Replying to a question about his five times in a row unsuccessful run-up during the first innings, he laughingly said that people are making it a joke.""Actually, I was making sure I don't 'No-ball' so I had to abort my run up each time,"" Riaz stated.In the end, Wahab Riaz expressed hope that the classy batsman Asad Shafiq and skipper Sarfraz would guide Pakistan to a win in this Test and help level the series."
1135,"VIENNA: The far-right Freedom Party (FPO) — set to become kingmaker after elections on October 15 — wants Austria to join the Visegrad Group of central and east European states opposed to immigration.Eurosceptic leaders in Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have refused migrant quotas approved by a western-dominated majority of European Union (EU) member states. They also reject proposed EU reforms that would transfer more power from national governments to Brussels institutions.The FPO — likely to be a part of Austria’s next ruling coalition — also wants a more decentralized EU.“We will… strengthen contact with the Visegrad states and it would be nice and good if we could maybe even become a member of the Visegrad Group,” FPO chief Heinz-Christian Strache said in an election debate with Social Democrat Chancellor Christian Kern focusing on curbing migrant flows and Brussels’ powers.The Freedom Party and centre-left Social Democrats are fighting for second place in Sunday’s election with both commanding about 25 percent of the vote in the latest polls.The Freedom Party appears ticketed for a place in the next coalition given that the conservative People’s Party’s rating of around 33 percent is unlikely to improve enough for an absolute majority, and bitter disputes between the two centrist parties.Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz has, like Strache, praised far-right Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for building a border fence to keep migrants out of EU territory.To avoid losing votes, Austria’s mainstream conservatives have drifted recently towards the FPO’s anti-immigration positions and joined calls to shrink and refocus the EU’s powers.Jean-Claude Juncker — the head of the European Commission — has invited Visegrad Group leaders to a meeting on October 18 to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western Europe."

1139,"Belgrade was gripped by anxiety before an overwhelming sense of joy and relief greeted Serbia reaching the World Cup with a nerve-jangling 1-0 home win over Georgia, thanks to substitute Aleksandar Prijovic’s 74th-minute goal on Monday.The result, celebrated ecstatically in the cauldron of Red Star’s Rajko Mitic stadium, left the Balkan nation top of Group D with 21 points from 10 games, two more than second-placed Ireland who booked a play-off spot with a 1-0 win at Wales.It is the second time Serbia have reached the finals as an independent nation, having been knocked in the group stages of the 2010 tournament in South Africa and then missing the next three major international soccer championships.Coach Slavoljub Muslin, a journeyman who had been in charge of a myriad of European clubs before he took over at Serbia for the qualifying campaign, was elated after the success.“I expected a tough game against Georgia and suspected that the final step would be the most difficult,” he told a news conference after the organisers set off spectacular fireworks which rocketed into the night sky over the Serbian capital.“Georgia were the better side in the first half and I told the players to move up a gear after the break, though we had to keep it tight at the back too.”Prijovic grabbed the winner with a fine finish to delight raucous home fans, who lit several flares to celebrate.It came after anything but the expected plain sailing for the home side, who looked disjointed for much of the contest after missing their first chance to qualify when they lost 3-2 at Austria on Friday.Serbia piled on the pressure from the offset but Georgia looked more likely to score in the first half and came close in the 17th minute when midfielder Valerian Gvilia forced a good save from Serbia keeper Vladimir Stojkovic.The Serbians carved out their first chance in the 39th minute, as visiting keeper Giorgi Makaridze blocked Dusan Tadic’s shot from a tight angle.Jeered off by their supporters at halftime, Serbia came out with renewed purpose after the break and defensive midfielder Nemanja Gudelj fired narrowly over the bar in the 48th minute.Shortly afterwards, striker Aleksandar Mitrovic saw his close-range header superbly saved by Makaridze and then sliced another wide of the far post as the home side threw men forward.Ivanovic headed inches wide after a corner the 67th minute and Nemanja Matic had a shot cleared off the line moments later as Serbia besieged the Georgian goal with a flurry of crosses from either flank.Prijovic finally broke the deadlock with a composed close-range finish after strike partner Mitrovic found him with a fine low cross following Ivanovic’s darting run through the middle.“Few fans believed after our barren eight-year run that we would qualify and all credit goes to the players, who left it all out there in every match,” Muslin added.“The fans played a big part too and I thank them.”"
1140,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Monday reserved its verdict in the contempt of court case against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, which will be announced on September 27.A four-member ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Justice (retd) Sardar Raza Khan, resumed hearing of the contempt case against the PTI chief on Monday.The PTI chief, in his reply submitted through his lawyer Babar Awan, stated that ""I respect the ECP and believe in the supremacy of institutions.""Khan stated that he confirms the apology tendered by his previous counsel, Saqlain Haider, regarding the ""contemptuous"" remarks, adding that the contempt of court matter is a ""closed transaction belonging to the past.""""The issue originated from non-submission of documents in the party funding case, however, the documents have been submitted to the ECP,"" the PTI chief stated, requesting the ECP to withdraw the show cause notice issued on September 24.His counsel, Babar Awan, pleaded the ECP to now dismiss contempt proceedings against his client.However, petitioner Akbar Babar's counsel objected saying Imran did not apologise to the court despite 13 chances given to him.Babar's counsel then submitted a fresh contempt petition in the ECP, stating that the PTI chief, in a press talk in Karachi on September 20, cast aspersions against the ECP impartiality.The ECP directed the PTI chief to submit his response with regards to the fresh petition by Akbar Babar. The verdict reserved in the case will also be announced on the same day.ECP has given the PTI chief until 8th May to submit his responseThe ECP further stated that it would make clear its next course of action after perusing the PTI chairman's reply.Later, addressing the media, Awan and PTI leader Naeemul Haque said former premier Nawaz Sharif wants a clash of state institutions in the country. They claimed that Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is a puppet, as the real strings are still being pulled by Nawaz. At the last hearing on September 14, the ECP had issued bailable warrants against Imran to ensure his presence in the case.However, the PTI approached the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the issuance of warrants. The IHC, on September 20, suspended the bailable arrest warrants. Hearing the case, Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a three-member larger bench, directed the PTI chief to reply to the ECP's show-cause notice.Awan assured the court that the PTI chairman would reply to the ECP's show-cause notice with regards to contempt proceedings against him.The IHC then adjourned the hearing until September 26.The ECP had ordered Imran to submit a surety bond of Rs100,000 until September 25 and nominate two persons who would ensure payment of the amount and be held responsible otherwise.IHC sends notices to Akbar S Babar, ECP to submit replies by Sept 7Imran was also ordered to appear on that day in the commission in person.Earlier, on September 14, during the hearing of contempt proceedings, Awan had argued before the ECP that proceedings against his client should be postponed until the matter is decided by the high court.The ECP had summoned Imran in person on that as well but he failed to do so.The ECP had issued the contempt notice to Khan on January 24 over his “scandalous remarks” about the commission.Akbar Babar, the petitioner who had filed the foreign funding case against the PTI leadership, had informed the ECP that the PTI chief had accused it of being biased in the foreign funding case following which his counsel tendered an apology with the commission."

They are also working with North Korea.""Ghasemi said there were ""no similarities nor resemblance"" with the actions of North Korea, and that claims they were working together on ballistic missile development amounted to a ""clear lie"".""It is very clear that this is a nonsense and baseless claim,"" he told reporters.Iran said on Saturday that it had tested its Khorramshahr missile with a range of 2,000 kilometres .The indigenously-built Khorramshahr was first announced by the defence ministry in September 2016, and US officials said it was this ballistic missile was tested in January, sparking international condemnation.However, Iran never confirmed that the January test was the Khorramshahr missile.There has been speculation, particularly from hawks in Washington, that the Khorramshahr was based on North Korea´s intermediate-range Musudan missile.In 2010, a diplomatic cable released by Wikileaks showed that US intelligence officers believed North Korea had shipped Musudan missiles to Iran.But analysts say the differing ranges cast doubt on those concerns.A detailed report earlier this year by the US-Korea Institute at John Hopkins University in the United States found: ""The available evidence cannot verify speculation that the Iranian missile is similar to North Korea´s Musudan"".Iran and North Korea have cooperated on military technology in the past.During Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s, it turned to North Korea as one of the only sources of military assistance, importing a stockpile of Nodong missiles.Iran used the Nodong to develop its own medium-range Shahab-3 missile, first tested in 1998, and it has continued to improve on the design since.But there has been scant evidence of direct cooperation between the two countries in recent years, with Iran seemingly keen to distance itself from the East Asian pariah state.Instead, Iran has emphasised its home-grown missile programme, and denied that this breaches any international laws.""Since the criticism of American officials, the speed of missile development has increased several times,"" said General Amir Ali Hadjizadeh, head of aerospace forces for the Iran´s elite Revolutionary Guards, according to state television on Monday.""All the material and pieces for our missiles are manufactured locally and do not come from abroad,"" he said.He said the Khorramshahr missile was 13 metres (43 feet) long and could carry a 1,800 kilogram payload."

1154,"DUBAI: Dubai staged a test flight on Monday for what it said would soon be the world’s first drone taxi service under an ambitious plan by the United Arab Emirates city to lead the Arab world in innovation.The flying taxi developed by German drone firm Volocopter resembles a small, two-seater helicopter cabin topped by a wide hoop studded with 18 propellers.It was unmanned for its maiden test run in a ceremony arranged for Dubai Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed.Meant to fly without remote control guidance and with a maximum flight duration of 30 minutes, it comes with plenty of fail-safes in case of trouble: back-up batteries, rotors and, for a worst case scenario, a couple of parachutes.Volocopter is in a race with more than a dozen well-funded European and US firms, each with its own science fiction-inspired vision for creating a new form of urban transport that is a cross between a driverless electric car and a short-haul, vertical takeoff-and-landing aircraft.These include aerospace giant Airbus, which aims to put a self-piloting taxi in the air by 2020; Kitty Hawk, a company backed by Google co-founder Larry Page; and Uber, which is working with partners on its own flying taxi strategy.“Implementation would see you using your smartphone, having an app, and ordering a Volocopter to the next voloport near you. The volocopter would come and autonomously pick you up and take you to your destination,” CEO Florian Reuter said.“It already is capable of flying based on GPS tracks today, and we will implement full sense capability, also dealing with unknown obstacles on the way,” he added, saying developers aimed to initiate the taxis within five years.In Monday’s test flight, the device hovered upward about 200 meters and whirred for about five minutes over a windswept patch of sand astride the emirate’s Gulf coast.Attired in crisp white robes and headdresses, Sheikh Hamdan and his entourage clapped approvingly from a nearby viewing deck as the craft alighted.The UAE has sought to distinguish itself in a region mired in war and strife as a high-tech, forward-looking society.It plans to send an unmanned probe to Mars by 2021, the Arab world’s first mission to space, and Dubai has in many ways led their showy march into the future by introducing the region’s first driverless metro and robot policemen prototypes.“Encouraging innovation and adopting the latest technologies contributes not only to the country‘s development but also builds bridges into the future,” Sheikh Hamdan said in a statement."

It was off-spinner Dilruwan Perera who ripped apart Pakistan with a triple strike in the second session. He dismissed Haris Sohail (10), Shan Masood (21) and Babar Azam (nought) to leave Pakistan in tatters at 52-5.He could have claimed the wickets of both Shafiq, on 26, and Ahmed, on 22, but both were dropped by Mendis at short leg off successive balls, leaving Sri Lanka to rue the missed chances.Pakistan made a disastrous start when opener Sami Aslam fell for one, caught in the slips off Lahiru Gamage.Masood and Azhar Ali (17) added 31 for the second wicket before the batting collapse began with Ali caught off fast bowler Nuwan Pradeep for 17.Pakistan had needed to make early inroads in the morning and Riaz provided them with the important wicket of Niroshan Dickwella in the fifth over of the day for 21.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah dismissed Perera for nought to leave Sri Lanka in danger of being all out for their lowest ever total of 71 against Pakistan.But Mendis (29) and Rangana Herath (17) added 35 for the eighth wicket to frustrate Pakistan before Sohail struck thrice in his only over to give his team hope of an upset win."

1161,"LONDON: The central character of the Memogate controversy made an appearance after a silence of many years at one of Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s event in Washington – and Hussain Haqqani was in Geneva at the same time for the current United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) session.When approached for his comments, Haqqani said: ""Memogate was just media noise, which is why the case has never been decided by the Supreme Court. That it disrupted lives without a conclusion is a sad reflection on how things work in Pakistan. I have moved on"".“I did nothing wrong, never went into hiding, and have always expressed my opinions publicly. In Geneva, I spoke as a Pakistani to seek justice for many of those who have been alienated from Pakistan so that more tragedies are averted.""Mansoor Ijaz, who was at the heart of the Memogate scandal which rocked the civilian government of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in 2012, can be seen in the audience at the discussion at Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) where PM Abbasi answered questions of the audience.Exactly when Mansoor Ijaz appeared in Washington DC, his former friend and Pakistan’s then ambassador to Washington Hussain Haqqani was in Geneva, Switzerland’s capital, meeting delegates to the current United Nations Human Rights Commission (UNHRC) addressing a seminar on Balochistan, organised by a nationalist group.Members of Pakistan’s delegation, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, journalists and local Pakistan-watchers can also be seen in the audience.More than half an hour to into the question and answer session, Mansoor Ijaz asked the prime minister a question about Pakistan’s nuclear programme and fears expressed about the programme often in the western press.The premier was also asked a question about the plutonium waste and what measures the country was taking for its safety.Prime Minister Abbasi replied that Pakistan’s nuclear assets were completely safe and Pakistan was a responsible nuclear country which has managed nuclear assets for well over 50 years without any problem.Mansoor Ijaz came to light in October 2011 when he made allegations that he was asked by Hussain Haqqani to help him prevent a possible military coup in Pakistan in the wake of Osama bin Laden’s killing. He wrote an article about the memorandum in a piece for the Financial Times.Ijaz claimed that Haqqani wrote the memo on behest of Asif Ali Zardari but Haqqani denied the claim. The Supreme Court of Pakistan set up a commission to investigate the matter and it is understood that then ISI’s chief Ahmed Shuja Pasha met Ijaz in London and later told the SC that after examining Ijaz's Blackberry phone records, he was satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to warrant an inquiry.Mansoor Ijaz told this scribe that he asked Pakistan PM question on nuclear concerns to put concerns to rest. ""My question was aimed at giving the prime minister a chance to alleviate concerns that Pakistan's fissile materials like plutonium waste could ever fall into the wrong hands. In my view, this concern has been overhyped for years by western journalists - even I was guilty of doing this in some of my op-ed pieces in the 2000s after the 9/11 attacks. But my opinion changed over the years, and Pakistan's long track record of safely building its nuclear assets from the 1960s onward through every possible type of political and military turmoil is demonstrable evidence of the safeguards inbuilt in Pakistan's nuclear program.”"
1162,"LONDON: Fish have complex individual personalities, a British university study found in research published Monday.Scientists from Exeter University in southwest England studied how individual Trinidadian guppy fish behaved in various stressful situations and discovered wide differences in how they responded.The researchers studied their coping strategies in situations designed to trigger various levels of stress.They found their modes of behaviour could not simply be explained as risk-taking or risk-averse.""When placed into an unfamiliar environment, we found guppies have various strategies for coping with this stressful situation -- many attempt to hide, others try to escape, some explore cautiously,"" said Tom Houslay, of the university´s Centre for Ecology and Conservation.""The differences between them were consistent over time and in different situations.""So, while the behaviour of all the guppies changed depending on the situation -- for example, all becoming more cautious in more stressful situations -- the relative differences between individuals remained intact.""The tiny guppies were individually transferred to an unfamiliar tank, to create a mild level of stress, while a higher level of stress was caused by adding models of predatory birds or fish.The study found that while introducing predators made the guppies overall more cautious, individuals still retained their distinct personalities.""We are interested in why these various personalities exist, and the next phase of our research will look at the genetics underlying personality and associated traits,"" said Alastair Wilson, from the CEC.""We want to know how personality relates to other facets of life, and to what extent this is driven by genetic -- rather than environmental -- influences.""The goal is really gaining insight into evolutionary processes, how different behavioural strategies might persist as species evolve.""The paper, entitled ""Testing the stability of behavioural coping style across stress contexts in the Trinidadian guppy"", was published in the journal Functional Ecology."

1166,"Japanese researchers have genetically engineered hens whose eggs contain drugs that can fight serious diseases including cancer, in a bid to dramatically reduce the cost of treatment, a report said Monday.If the scientists are able to safely produce ""interferon beta"", a type of protein used to treat illnesses including multiple sclerosis and hepatitis, by rearing the hens, the price of the drug -- currently up to 100,000 yen ($888) for a few microgrammes -- could fall significantly, said the English edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun.Researchers at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in the Kansai region kicked off the process by introducing genes that produce interferon beta into cells which are precursors of chicken sperm, the newspaper reported.They then used these cells to fertilise eggs and create hens which inherited those genes, meaning the birds were able to lay eggs containing the disease-fighting agent.The scientists now have three hens whose eggs contain the drug, with the birds laying eggs almost daily, the report said.The researchers plan to sell the drug to pharmaceutical companies, halving its price, so the firms can use it first as a research material, the newspaper said.Consumers may have to wait a while, as Japan has strict regulations concerning the introduction of new or foreign pharmaceutical products, with screening processes that routinely take years to complete.But the team hopes that the technological breakthrough will eventually help drive down the cost of the drug to 10 percent of its current price, the newspaper reported.Officials at the institute could not be reached for comment"
1167,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - US economist Richard Thaler won the 2017 Nobel Economics Prize for his contributions in the field of behavioral economics, showing how human traits affect supposedly rational markets, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Monday.Thaler brought to prominence the idea of “nudge” economics, where humans are subtly guided toward beneficial behaviors without heavy-handed compulsion, the theme of a 2008 book he co-wrote which caught the eye of policymakers around the world.In his award citation, the Academy said his research had harnessed psychologically realistic assumptions in analyses of economic decision-making, exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control.“In total, Richard Thaler’s contributions have built a bridge between the economic and psychological analyses of individual decision-making,” the award-giving body said on announcing the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize.“His empirical findings and theoretical insights have been instrumental in creating the new and rapidly expanding field of behavioral economics, which has had a profound impact on many areas of economic research and policy.”The economics prize, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was established in 1968. It was not part of the original group of awards set out in dynamite tycoon Nobel’s 1895 will.Economy is the last of this year's Nobels. The prizes for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and peace were all awarded last week. (Graphics on 'Nobel Laureates' - here)The United States has dominated the economics prize, with American economists accounting for roughly half of laureates since the inception of the award. Indeed, between 2000 and 2013, US academics won or shared the prize every year.While few economists are household names, past winners have included Milton Friedman, in 1976, whose work is a cornerstone of current monetary policy, and James Tobin, in 1981, who proposed countries should tax financial transactions.Some countries in the European Union agreed on such a tax to help fight the debt crisis, but implementation has been delayed, among other things by Britain’s decision to leave the bloc."
1168,"ANKARA: Turkey urged the United States on Monday to review its suspension of visa services after the arrest of a US consulate employee sharply escalated tensions between the two NATO allies and drove Turkey’s currency and stocks lower.Relations between Ankara and Washington have long been plagued by disputes over US support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, Turkey’s calls for the extradition of a US-based cleric and the indictment of a Turkish former minister in a US court.But last week’s arrest of a Turkish employee of the US consulate in Istanbul marked a fresh low. Turkey said the employee had links to US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for a failed military coup in July 2016.The US embassy in Ankara condemned those charges as baseless and announced on Sunday night it was halting all non-immigrant visa services in Turkey while it reassessed Turkey’s commitment to the security of its missions and staff.Within hours Turkey announced it was taking the same measures against US citizens.On Monday the Turkish foreign ministry summoned a US diplomat to urge the United States to lift the visa suspension, saying it was causing “unnecessary tensions”.Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said that if Washington had serious security concerns about its missions in Turkey, steps would be taken to address them.“But if it’s an issue regarding the arrest of the consulate employee, then this is a decision the Turkish judiciary has made,” Gul told A Haber television. “Trying a Turkish citizen for a crime committed in Turkey is our right.”Turkish media reported that authorities had issued a detention warrant for a second US consulate worker. Reuters could not immediately confirm the reports, which also said the employee’s wife and child were being questioned by police.The diplomatic spat spooked investors. The lira dropped 2.4 percent and stood at 3.7030 against the dollar after being quoted overnight as touching a level of 3.9223.The main BIST 100 stock index fell as much as 4.7 percent and was down 3.21 percent at 100,800 points at 1137 GMT.Airline shares were particularly hard hit, with flag carrier Turkish Airlines falling 8 percent.The central bank said it was following developments closely.“This looks like a really serious situation,” said Blue Bay Asset Management strategist Timothy Ash, adding that the central bank would need to move quickly to calm market nerves and possibly hike interest rates - something President Tayyip Erdogan has resisted.Turkey’s leading business association, TUSIAD, warned that the dispute would harm bilateral economic, social and cultural ties, and called for disagreements to be settled calmly.The dispute with the United States coincides with deep strains in Turkey’s relations with Germany, another key ally, and with Turkish military activity at the Syrian and Iraqi borders, though their market impact has so far been limited.US-Turkish tensions have risen in recent months over US military support for Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, considered by Ankara to be an extension of the banned PKK which has waged an insurgency for three decades in southeast Turkey.Turkey has also pressed, so far in vain, for the United States to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, viewed in Ankara as the mastermind behind the failed coup in which more than 240 people were killed. Gulen denies any involvement.Friction with the United States has also arisen from the indictment last month by a US court of Turkey’s former economy minister Zafer Caglayan, charged with conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran.Sinan Ulgen, an analyst and former Turkish diplomat, said those underlying disputes had created a “crisis of confidence” which made this latest fallout particularly bitter.“This harshness is a result of a build-up,” he said. “We should not consider this as solely a reaction to the detentions of consulate employees”."
1169,"MUMBAI: Twenty Indian farmers have died and hundreds of others are in hospital after inhaling poisonous pesticides while spraying crops, officials said Monday, highlighting lax safety standards in the country.The farmers in the western state of Maharashtra, one of India's most important agricultural regions, died after using the dangerous pesticides without wearing protective gear.""Twenty farmers are dead and hundreds are undergoing medical treatment. Fifty are critical with damage to their eyesight,"" Kishore Tewari, the spokesman for a state government task force that helps farmers in distress, told AFP.The first death was reported in August and the number of fatalities increased throughout September, according to local news reports.They occurred in the Yavatmal region, around 670 kilometres (416 miles) from the financial capital Mumbai.Activists blame a lack of regulations covering pesticides and a failure to provide poor farmers with proper safety equipment.Tewari said the victims had not worn boots, masks or gloves. Victims reported experiencing blurred vision and excruciating headaches, he added.""I don't have the money to buy protective gear and we spray pesticides without any safety kits,"" broadcaster NDTV quoted one farmer as saying.Last week the Bombay High Court called on the Maharashtra government to ban the sale of pesticides in the affected areas.Yavatmal police superintendent M Rajkumar told AFP that several cases had been filed against a local agricultural centre which sells pesticides to farmers.India has nearly 260 million farmers and farm labourers eking out a meagre living.Their livelihoods are regularly destroyed by drought and 1,417 farmers killed themselves in Maharashtra in 2016, according to official figures.In June the state government agreed to write off loans to farmers estimated to be worth nearly $5 billion."
1170,"WASHINGTON: Google has discovered that Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on YouTube, Gmail, Google search and other products, The Washington Post reported on Monday.The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, which may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, the paper reported. Google runs the world’s largest online advertising business and YouTube is the world’s largest online video site.Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the story.Google has downplayed the possibility of Russian influence on its platforms, but launched a probe into the matter, according to the Post. Both Twitter Inc and Facebook have said that Russia bought ads and had accounts on their platforms.Meanwhile, Congress has started multiple investigations into the Russian interference in the 2016 election, with lawmakers on both political sides saying Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election to elect President Donald Trump.Google officials are expected to testify publicly before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election."
1171,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz wants to give the current accountability process a political shade, said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Monday.In a statement, Qureshi said it is not appropriate for the Sharif family to try to gain sympathy rather than defending the corruption cases against them. Meanwhile, PTI chairman's spokesperson, Naeemul Haque, said Maryam Nawaz's criticism of the ongoing situation is akin to criticising her own self. He said they [Sharifs] themselves are responsible for eradicating the rule of law from the country. Earlier today, the accountability court hearing corruption cases against the Sharif family approved the bail of Maryam and her husband MNA Capt (retd) Safdar after they appeared in court.Judge Mohammad Bashir also approved the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) plea to declare Hasan and Hussain Nawaz proclaimed offenders and separated their proceedings in the three references filed against them. Their non-bailable arrest warrants, issued earlier, continue. The court has set October 13 as the next date of hearing at which Nawaz Sharif — regardless of his presence —, Maryam and Safdar will be indicted. The accountability court is hearing a total of three corruption cases against the Sharif family filed by NAB in light of the Supreme Court's judgment in the Panama Papers case.  "
1172,"ISLAMABAD: The Leader of the Opposition Syed Khursheed Shah said on Monday that no compromise was reached to select the new chairman of the National Accountability Bureau. Shah said the opposition has not complained regarding the new appointment neither has anyone else criticised it. The opposition leader and senior PPP leader added that Javed Iqbal, the new NAB chairman, will not be dictated by anyone and has a clean past. Shah said that four meetings were held recently to decide on the name of the new NAB chairman with the members of the opposition and the government.He further added that being a former apex court judge, Iqbal possesses valuable judgment skills and especially lauded his report in the Abbottabad Commission — which he headed.The incumbent NAB chairman, Qamar Zaman Chaudhry, is retiring on October 10 after the completion of his four-year tenure. Earlier, the Pakistan Peoples Party leader had proposed Justice (retd) Faqer Mohammad Khokhar, Justice (retd) Javed Iqbal and former secretary of the Election Commission of Pakistan Ishtiaque Ahmed Khan for the post, whereas the government had suggested Justice (retd) Rehmat Jafry, Justice (retd) Chaudhry Aijaz and Intelligence Bureau Director-General Aftab Sultan.Shah had also met Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Friday to discuss the matter of the chairman's selection. Justice (retd) Iqbal was appointed as a Supreme Court justice in 2000 and retired in 2011. He headed the Abbottabad Inquiry Commission, formed to probe the controversial raid by US Special Forces which led to the killing of wanted terrorist Osama bin Laden.The commission investigated and reported the circumstances surrounding the May 2011 raid at a compound in Abbottabad. The commission interviewed over 300 witnesses and gave 200 recommendations in its 700-page report to the prime minister. The report was immediately classified, but a version was leaked by an international news network."
1173,"KATHMANDU: Matina Shakya was only three when she was taken away from her parents to be worshipped as a ""living goddess"" in Nepal's historic capital. On Monday she finally started school after puberty ended her nine-year reign.Dressed in a green uniform and stripped of the heavy make-up she used to wear, Shakya, 12, looked like any other student as she walked into the Green Peace Co-ed School in Kathmandu.Fellow students and teachers had gathered outside to welcome her, playing music and waving flags - a small reminder of the huge crowds she used to draw as Kathmandu's Kumari, or living goddess.""We are excited to have her with us, and we are discussing how to ease her and help her adjust in the new environment,"" said the principal Pema Yonjan.The Kumari is a pre-pubescent girl who lives in a temple palace in the heart of Kathmandu as part of a centuries-old tradition and is considered the embodiment of the Hindu goddess Taleju.She only leaves the temple 13 times a year on special feast days, when huge crowds of worshippers gather to see her.That means the Kumaris cannot attend school, and most have struggled to reintegrate into society after they retire.But Shakya received private tuition following a 2008 Supreme Court ruling that the living goddesses should be educated.Her father Pratap Man Shakya said she had attended nursery at the school and he was confident she would be able to adapt to her new life.""We hope now that she is going to school in a good environment she will become an even better student,"" he told AFP.Shakya was anointed as the Kumari in 2008, leaving her home to be cared for by specially-appointed guardians, and only retired last month as she neared puberty. The tradition of the Kumari, originating from a word meaning princess in Sanskrit, comes from the Newar community indigenous to the Kathmandu Valley.It blends elements of Hinduism and Buddhism and the most important Kumaris represent each of the three former royal kingdoms of the valley: Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur.The tradition was once closely linked to the royal family, but has continued despite the end of Nepal's Hindu monarchy in 2008.It has drawn criticism from child rights activists who say the Kumaris are denied a childhood and their isolation from society hinders their education and development.Shakya was replaced by three-year-old Trishna Shakya last month."
1174,KARACHI: Pakistan’s all-rounder Haris Sohail achieved a unique feat on Monday by claiming three wickets in his single-over spell in Dubai Test.Haris came to deliver the 26th over of Sri Lanka’s 2nd innings of the Test as they were struggling at 95 for 7.The 28-year bowler got the wicket of Herath on the first ball of his over. After conceding a single he got another wicket when Mendis was caught behind by Sarfraz Ahmed off the fourth delivery of the over.Haris then got the wicket of Fernando on the last ball of his over to finish his single-over bowling spell with 3 wickets for 1 run. Haris Sohail’s memorable 3-wickets over also bundled Sri Lanka’s second innings for 96 runs.The bowling figure 1-0-1-3 by Haris Sohail is now the best ever by a bowler who has bowled just one over in the innings. Previously Ramnaresh Sarwan of West Indies got the bowling figures of 1-0-1-2 at Bridgetown Test against India in 2002.
1175,"UNITED NATIONS: Leaders of France, Italy and the United Kingdom urged social media companies on Wednesday to more swiftly remove “terrorist content” from the internet, with the aim of stopping it from being uploaded in the first place.“The tech companies have made significant progress on this issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online,” British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly of world leaders in New York.She said there was a need “to increase significantly the efforts to stop (extremist content) being uploaded in the first place.”French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni later pushed in a separate event hosted by May for such content to be removed swiftly.”This is what must be done. In one hour the content must be identified, analyzed and withdrawn to avoid it being broadcast widely. Experience shows that this is possible,” said Macron, speaking through an interpreter.“We have a real battlefield for hearts and minds and (it) is the web,” Gentiloni said.He said economic and privacy issues were a hurdle in this process, “but we also have to know, if we are aware of the fact that this battlefield is so relevant, that we can’t reduce our ambition because of the difficulties.”Several websites across the internet list ingredients for making bombs or instructions on how to use vehicles to attack pedestrians.Online retailer Amazon.com said on Wednesday it was reviewing its website after an investigation found it could help users buy the ingredients to make a bomb using its “Frequently bought together” and “Customers who bought this also bought” features.The European Union has threatened legislation if internet companies do not better police what is available on the web.“Removing all of this content within a few hours - or indeed stopping it from appearing on the internet in the first place - poses an enormous technological and scientific challenge,” said Kent Walker, general counsel for Alphabet Inc’s Google.“The haystacks here are unimaginably large and the needles are both very small and constantly changing.”Walker spoke on behalf of Facebook Inc, Microsoft Corp, Google subsidiary YouTube and Twitter Inc, all members of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism created in June under pressure from governments in Europe and the United States after a spate of militant attacks.Its aim is to share technical solutions for removing extremist content and work more closely with counter-terrorism experts.Walker said between August 2015 and June 2017, Twitter had suspended almost a million accounts for the promotion of terrorism, and that the use of technology and artificial intelligence had allowed Facebook to root out “terrorist clusters.”"
1176,"MEXICO CITY: Adriana Fargo nervously bites her lip as she waits for news on the fate of her seven-year-old daughter, feared buried in the earthquake-hit remains of a Mexico City elementary and middle school.At least 21 children died when a three story wing of the Enrique Rebsamen school collapsed after a 7.1 magnitude quake struck Mexico on Tuesday.Thirty children are missing, and some could still be alive.""No one can possibly imagine the pain I'm in right now,"" said Fargo, wrapped in a blanket as she sat with other anguished parents Wednesday in an improvised shelter near the school.What is the girl’s name? Fargo's fists tighten and she stares at the ground, unable to pronounce her daughter's name. Her lips strain as she holds back what appears to be a mournful wail of pain.After sunrise there was a glimmer of hope amid the torture of uncertainty: rescuers confirmed that they located a girl alive and trapped in the rubble.There was a call for absolute silence as the rescuers slid a thermal scanner down a narrow crack where they had made contact with the child.""We are very, very close to people who could be alive. We're working with thermal cameras and canine units,"" said volunteer rescuer Pamela Diaz, a bread baker by profession.""We keep moments of absolute silence to listen for survivors. They tend to cry out or bang on walls,"" she told AFP by telephone.Another rescuer, 42 year-old Flor Gonzalez, gave a grim description her experience.""Last night I counted five cadavers that were removed from the school,"" said Gonzalez, a dentist who spent the night volunteering at the school.""I saw when they notified one of the parents . ... it was devastating,"" she said, as tears swelled in her eyes.A third rescuer, speaking on condition of anonymity, earlier told AFP that there were signs of even more survivors -- possibly 20 children trapped inside a classroom with a teacher.He said there also appeared to be nine lifeless bodies in the debris.Up to now, 11 children and at least one teacher were pulled alive from the rubble.However, rescuers also pulled out 26 lifeless bodies -- all but five of them children, said rescue coordinator Jose Luis Vergara.President Enrique Pena Nieto, who rushed to the site late Tuesday, warned that the death toll could rise.At least 217 people were reported killed by the earthquake.Fargo's husband joined the hundreds of soldiers, firefighters and rescuers clawing away at the debris since the quake struck.Armed with picks, shovels and even their bare hands, the crew worked through the night in their desperate search for survivors.""Silence, please!"" a police officer barked through a megaphone. ""Don't walk, don't breathe, we're trying to hear voices!"" Any sign of life from under the rubble was welcome.A stream of volunteers, many with lamps attached to their helmets, carried long wooden beams to prop up building sections that were in danger of collapsing.Other volunteers formed a human chain to hand baskets of bottled water to the rescuers. The baskets then returned filled with debris.Maria del Pilar Marti, a teacher who works at the Enrique Rebsamen school, said that many children stayed in the building when the quake hit.""We had to take cover in our classrooms until the quake ended,"" she told Televisa news. ""Then we were covered in a cloud of dust when part of the building totally collapsed.""Tuesday's earthquake struck as the country was recovering from an 8.2 magnitude quake that hit on September 7 in southern Mexico, killing around 100 people and destroying homes.In the aftermath Mexican authorities said they had inspected the country's schools, and verified that the structures were quake resistant.The earthquake also hit on the anniversary of a massive 1985 quake that killed more than 10,000 people, an event that still haunts a country that has seen its share of disasters.Power outages, intermittent cell phone coverage and roads closed due to debris complicate the rescue.In front of the school, two people sat at a table with a computer at an informal control center, keeping track of the children and teachers who died, those who were rescued and those still missing.""It's chaos ... there are children that escaped the school but were injured, and are alone in hospitals without their parents,"" one of the people keeping track of the victims told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.""Meanwhile here at school there are desperate parents that can't find their children."""
1177,"LONDON: Violence, intimidation, assaults and other hate crimes targeting mosques and Muslims have doubled in Britain during the current year, according to police records.The police recorded 110 hate crimes from March to July 2017 in Britain compared to 47 in 2016.Crimes include racist abuse, threats to bomb mosques, attacks on mosques and worshipers.Shadow Home Secretary Diana Abbott strongly condemned the rise in hate crimes and said that it is totally unacceptable. In a report obtained by local media, under the freedom of information(FOI), suggests that a comprehensive law was needed in the country to stop the hate crimes, “major incidents of hate crimes took place in London and Manchester”. The report also says that racist abuse and threats to ""bomb the mosque"" feature heavily among the reported hate crime as do incidents of offenders smashing windows of buildings and parked cars.Other crimes include offensive graffiti sprayed onto buildings, violent assaults on worshippers, two cases of arson and two cases of individuals leaving bacon on door handles of mosques. “The figures, based on 42 responses from 45 forces, also show 25 forces saw a year-on-year increase in hate crimes directed at mosques, with the biggest rise reported by Greater Manchester Police (nine crimes, up from zero) and London's Metropolitan Police (17 crimes, up from eight). Threats, harassment or other intimidating behavior more than tripled, from 14 incidents in 2016 to 49 in 2017. Violent crime against individuals also more than doubled, from five recorded crimes against worshippers at mosques in 2016 to 11 crimes in 2017. Crimes recorded as vandalism or criminal damage increased from 12 in 2016 to 15 in 2017. Due to differences in how police forces record their statistics and the fact that not all forces are included in the figures, the true number of hate crimes directed at mosques are likely to be higher.Britain endured several terror attacks claimed by Daesh over the period in which the crimes were recorded, at London Bridge, Westminster and Manchester.The figures came to light within weeks of separate incidents in which an imam and a surgeon who treated Manchester bombing victims were stabbed outside a mosque in Cheshire and a 14-year-old boy was stabbed multiple times in the face and neck outside a mosque in Birmingham.Other high-profile cases of hate crime at mosques this year include the Finsbury Park terror attack in June, a Manchester mosque gutted by fire in an arson attack in July and the sending of white powder and bomb threats to three mosques across London in July.At least one person has been pronounced dead, with eight others injuredWhile police found the powder to be harmless, Erkin Guney, a community leader at one of the mosques targeted by the letters, called the threats ""heartbreaking"". The Shacklewell Lane Mosque in north London, where Guney is a funeral director, has seen ""attacks by the BNP, pigs' heads thrown at the door and buildings set alight"" over the years since his father founded the mosque in the 1970s, he said.""That's a really heavy responsibility. Now to worry that people are going to die on my doorstep is heartbreaking.""I'm not concerned about myself, I'm concerned about the public and the people that come here,"" he added.""We've got community events that take place here. Everyone comes, it's not just about Muslims in the mosque."" More than 50 places of worship, almost half of them mosques, applied for the most recent round of anti-hate crime funding from the British government, which ended in June.Applications for funding, intended to provide security measures, were made available to all places of worship in April and May, but extended into June after terror attacks at the start of the summer.Abbott called on the Home Office to publish data on hate crimes against all places of worship ""as a matter of course"" after ""worrying reports of attacks on synagogues as well as mosques"". She said: ""Politicians have a particular responsibility in the language they use, the policies they advocate and the climate they create.""There should be a unanimous message that violence against any section of our society is unacceptable. She called the figures ""deeply troubling” and said attacks on any religious group or minority are abominable, “These anti-Muslim attacks will be condemned by all decent people."" While responding to the report, A Home Office spokesman said: ""All forms of hate crime are completely unacceptable and the UK has some of the strongest laws in the world to tackle it."""

""However please note that we cannot provide any details concerning the matters under investigation.""According to The Times newspaper, FIFA were looking into ""possible breaches of the regulations regarding the signing of young foreign players"", while Chelsea replied: ""Chelsea FC complies with all FIFA statutes and regulations.""The alleged offences were reported to be ""less serious"" than the violations committed by Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid that prompted FIFA last year to issue the Spanish clubs with transfer bans.Chelsea were initially hit with a transfer embargo in 2009 following the transfer of Gael Kakuta from French club Lens, but the ruling was overturned following an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.They were also under investigation last year over the signing of Burkina Faso forward Bertrand Traore after images emerged of him playing for Chelsea when he was just 16 and before he received international clearance.Real and Atletico were barred from registering new players for two transfer windows in January 2016 for irregularities in the signing of foreign players under the age of 18.Real's sanction was halved on appeal by CAS, allowing the European champions to recruit players this past summer, but Atletico are unable to sign anyone until January 2018."

1180,"KARACHI: The macroeconomic factors are far from encouraging and vehemently on the rise during the fiscal year 2017, according to a World Bank report published recently.The WB’s 'South Asia Economic Focus Fall 2017' report mentioned that the macroeconomic uncertainties are increasing due to which the balance of payments is disrupted.The ongoing fiscal deficit is primarily due to lack of foreign reserves, the World Bank report stated.Making the right fiscal policies can alleviate Pakistan’s economic woes, asserted the report. It suggested that an increase in exports can help improve the balance of payments.Higher exports, decrease in imports, and stable remittance flows can ensure stability vis-à-vis balance of payments, it said.The global financial institution stated that due to the upcoming general elections in 2018, the fiscal situation may deteriorate, adding that due to the ouster of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, political uncertainties have grown. The report mentioned that the problems pertaining to the financial framework can decrease the ratio of growth of the economy.APP adds: Pakistan’s economic growth is expected to accelerate to more than five percent this and in the coming years if the country’s fiscal deficits are well managed and external stability is maintained.Efforts to reverse the trade and fiscal imbalances and continued implementation of reforms will be needed for sustaining and accelerating growth and improving welfare,"" said World Bank in its report.The report says that Pakistan has potential to accelerate its growth rate upto 5.5. percent in Fiscal Year 2017-18 and to 5.8 percent in Fiscal year 2018-19. Giving overall picture of growth of South Asia, the report said that after leading global growth for two years, the region has fallen to second place, after East Asia and the Pacific.The region’s slowdown is due to both temporary shocks and longer-term challenges.Regional economic growth is expected to slow to 6.9 percent in 2017 from 7.5 percent in 2016, but growth could rebound to 7.1 percent in 2018 with the right mix of policies and reforms.The just released twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus (SAEF) finds that the slowdown in South Asia has mostly been driven by internal factors, most notably in India, such as a decrease in private investment, and an increase in imports and government spending.This edition, Growth out of the Blue, explores the potential of night-time light satellite imagery to improve measurement and understanding of economic activities.While growth rates in South Asia largely remain robust given the economic shocks that some countries in the region have faced, countries should continue to actively address their growing trade and fiscal deficits, said Annette Dixon, the World Bank South Asia Region Vice President.With the right mix of policies to respond to challenges, we remain confident that South Asian countries can accelerate their growth to create more opportunities and prosperity for their people.The report also highlights that South Asia was once at the cutting edge in economic measurement and analysis, pioneering techniques such as the use of household surveys.With the rise of big data, traditional ways to measure economic phenomena like prices and GDP can be supplemented.To improve economic measurement in South Asia, a greater reliance on big data may help, but a clear agenda toward stronger statistical systems is a necessity."
1181,"LONDON: British scientists have used genome ""editing"" technology to reveal the role of a key gene in the early development of human embryos, a potential boost for fertility treatment.They used genome ""scissors"" called CRISPR-Cas9 to snip out a gene called OCT4 from fertilised eggs.OCT4 is thought to be a major player in embryo formation.""After the egg is fertilised, it divides until at about seven days it forms a ball of around 200 cells called the 'blastocyst',"" authors of the study explained in a press release on Wednesday.""The study found that human embryos need OCT4 to correctly form a blastocyst.""This was the first use of genome editing to study gene function in human embryos, which could help scientists to better understand early development, said the Francis Crick Institute, whose researchers took part in the study.""This proof of principle lays out a framework for future investigations that could transform our understanding of human biology,"" said the study published in the science journal Nature.The work boosts the quest for therapeutic use of stem cells and in IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) treatments,"" it said.On a technical level, the study confirmed CRISPR-Cas9 editing as a ""powerful method"" for probing the role of individual genes in human development.The technique -- repeatedly mooted as a worthy candidate for a Nobel -- allows scientists to remove and replace a faulty sequence on a strand of DNA with pinpoint precision.The method can theoretically be used to eliminate disease-bearing mutations in embryos, or to engineer more nutritious and resilient plants and healthier livestock.It is controversial because, say critics, it evokes a future in which humans can order ""designer"" babies with specific features, perhaps even intelligence.""One way to find out what a gene does in the developing embryo is to see what happens when it isnât working.

1182,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said the days of Pakistan’s dependence on the US to meet its military requirements have ended.In an interview to Arab News, published on Monday, the premier said the world should recognise Pakistan’s efforts in fighting the “world’s war” on terror. “If one source dries up, we have no option but to go to another source. It may cost more, it may consume more resources, but we have to fight that war, and that’s what we emphasised to all the people that we met.”“We have major US weapons systems in our military, but we’ve also diversified [our arsenal]. We have Chinese and European systems. Recently, for the first time we inducted Russian attack helicopters,” Abbasi informed.  Responding to a question, the premier said that US’ newly devised policy to include India for peacebuilding in Afghanistan will be detrimental for the region. “We don’t believe that injecting India into the Pakistan-US relationship will help resolve anything, especially in Afghanistan, where we don’t see any role for India. India has a relationship with the US, and that is between them and the US,” Abbasi said.He added that Pakistan wants an ‘equal relationship or partnership with the US, like every other nation’ and wants to work with Washington in resolving regional and global issues ranging from the ‘economy to nuclear matters’.He said that in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and side meetings, he stressed that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan.""We’re partners in the war on terror, and that’s what we emphasised. We emphasised to everybody we met [at the UNGA] that nobody wants peace in Afghanistan more than Pakistan”.He disclosed that investigations showed that the person who carried out a suicide attack on deputy chairman of Senate in Mastung, Balochistan on May 12 was an Afghan national who had crossed the border for the attack.“The reality today is that much of the area bordering Pakistan is controlled by the Taliban. The people we’re fighting in Pakistan today, their sanctuaries are in Afghanistan, their leadership is living there, the planning is done there, the logistical bases are there, and they regularly cross the border and attack our installations. We recently had a suicide attack on the deputy chairman of the Senate. He survived, but 22 people were killed. It was by an Afghan national who had crossed the border to attack his convoy deep inside Pakistan,” he said.Abbasi said that in the recently held meeting between Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Asif told his counterpart that Islamabad pursues a zero-tolerance approach to “all terrorist and militant groups.”He called his meeting with US Vice President Mike Pence, ‘very constructive’.“There was no meeting scheduled (with President Trump). In fact, the meeting with Vice President Pence wasn’t scheduled [either]. It was at their request,” the prime minister said."

1184,"NEW YORK: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi Wednesday said Pakistan did not expect any significant shift in the United States' policy towards it and the country was ready to work with the Trump administration, especially to fight terrorism.Speaking to Christiane Amanpour of CNN in an interview during his visit to New York to attend the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly, the prime minister believed that there could be the difference of opinions on the modalities as how Pakistan operated in the region.""Relations have ups and downs. We believe this relationship is not defined by Afghanistan. It is a 70-year-old relationship. We have always been an ally especially the partners in the war against terror. That is how we look at it,"" the Prime Minister remarked.Asked to comment on US President Donald Trump's policy statement, Prime Minister Abbasi again termed it a difference of opinion saying that Pakistan looked at the situation differently as the country had fought the war against terrorism, suffering huge casualties.Even today, he said, thousands of soldiers were fighting the menace, he maintained.Responding to a query, the Prime Minister said, ""Terrorism is a threat to everybody. For us, India was the force that we have fought three wars with. India is a threat to Pakistan. We accept that. They are a nuclear power. We have to defend ourselves several times against India.""On being asked by the interviewer that Pakistan too had nuclear power, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan had developed nuclear weapons against the threats India posed.To another question about the possible US policy shift, the prime minister said he had met US Vice President Mike Pence on Tuesday and explained to him Pakistan's role in that regard.He reiterated Pakistan's willingness to work with US in the war against terrorism, considering it as a common enemy.About the North Korean nuclear programme, Prime Minister Abbasi said North Korea should follow the requirements of international regulatory authorities.He categorically denied that Pakistan had contributed anything to the North Korean nuclear programme rather stressed Pyongyang to behave responsibly.To a question, whether Pakistan was concerned over the North Korean nuclear programme, he said, ""Definitely, it is a cause for concern. We have also condemned their nuclear tests."""
1185,"United Nations: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday declared the time for dialogue with North Korea is over and rallied behind a US warning that ""all options"" are on the table.Addressing the UN General Assembly, Abe said ""there is not much time left"" to take action on North Korea which in recent weeks has detonated another nuclear bomb and fired a series of missiles over or near Japan.A day after US President Donald Trump threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it attacks, Abe said: ""We consistently support the stance of the United States: that 'all options are on the table.'""Abe said that the world has already tried exhaustively to reach a negotiated settlement with North Korea, starting with the US-backed 1994 Agreed Framework which collapsed a decade later.""Again and again, attempts to resolve issues through dialogue have all come to naught. In what hope of success are we now repeating the very same failure a third time?"" he said.""What is needed to do that is not dialogue, but pressure,"" he said.He voiced alarm at North Korea's military progress, which he said had brought the regime to the threshold of mastering hydrogen bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles, which would be able to strike the United States.Abe demanded the strict implementation of UN sanctions on Kim Jong-Un's regime, the latest round of which includes a ban on the country's textile exports and a freeze on work permits to North Korean guest workers.But years of sanctions have had limited effects on North Korea, which follows a ""juche"" ideology of self-reliance and counts on neighboring China as its economic lifeline.China -- which has grown frustrated by Kim's actions but also fears the consequences of his regime's collapse -- has repeatedly urged dialogue, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday urging an end to the ""current deepening vicious cycle.""Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, responding to Trump's bellicose speech, called for dialogue in tandem with implementation of sanctions.""There is no military solution because that would be a disaster, not only for North Korea but for South Korea, the whole peninsula, Japan,"" Lofven told reporters.But Abe warned that global credibility was on the line, saying that only North Korea has been ""allowed such self-indulgence"" in its defiance of the Security Council.""North Korea is attempting to dismiss with a smirk the efforts towards disarmament we have assiduously undertaken over the years,"" Abe said.Abe, Japan's longest-serving post-World War II prime minister, rose to political prominence on his calls for a tough line on North Korea over its past abductions of Japanese civilians.He has also pressed for a shedding of defense taboos in Japan, whose US-imposed constitution forbids the country from ever again waging war."

Unlike previous versions of the watch, it has cellular network connectivity built in.Apple said the watch can experience LTE connectivity problems when it connects to open wi-fi networks such as at a hotel or a coffee shop.The company is “investigating a fix for a future software release,” Apple spokeswoman Amy Bessette told Reuters.Many reviewers such as the New York Times praised the new features and gave generally positive assessments.But other prominent publications, including the Wall Street Journal and The Verge, recommended against purchasing the new model because the LTE cellular data connectivity did not work as expected.The mixed reviews weighed on Apple shares, which closed down about 1.7 percent at $156.07.“Considering that my Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE (both first and second review units) didn’t function like it was supposed to, I can’t recommend buying it — and paying the monthly cell fee — based on promises,” Verge reviewer Lauren Goode wrote.Apart from connection issues, some reviewers were disappointed with the drain on the watch’s battery while making calls.

1192,"MEXICO CITY: Mexican rescuers on Wednesday laboured for a second night amid the rubble to save possible survivors of the country’s most lethal earthquake in a generation, including a girl trapped under a school in Mexico City, as the death toll exceeded 230.Television stations broadcast live the painstaking, hours-long attempt to rescue the girl after crews at the school in the south of the city reported seeing her hand move. They threaded a hose through debris to get her water.The girl’s name was not made public, but her family waited in anguish nearby.Rescuers moved slowly, erecting makeshift wooden scaffolding to prevent rubble from crumbling further and seeking a path to the child through the unstable ruins. They implored bystanders to be quiet to better hear calls for help.It was part of the careful search for dozens of victims feared buried beneath the Enrique Rebsamen school, where officials reported 21 children and four adults dead after Tuesday’s quake. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed.“We have a lot of hope that some will still be rescued,” said David Porras, one of scores of volunteers helping the search at the school for children aged 3 to 14.“But we’re slow, like turtles,” he said.By Wednesday morning, the workers said a teacher and two students had sent text messages from within the rubble. Parents clung to hope that their children were alive.The magnitude 7.1 quake, which killed at least 93 people in the capital, struck 32 years to the day after a 1985 earthquake that killed thousands. Mexico is also still reeling from a powerful tremor that killed nearly 100 people in the south of the country less than two weeks ago.On Wednesday afternoon, officials told bystanders to move back from the Plaza Condesa building which houses a well-known concert hall frequented by famous international acts and a popular bar in the upscale Condesa neighbourhood.The order sparked fears the massive building could collapse, just like an apartment block about 100 meters (yards) away where emergency crews spent Wednesday sifting though rubble.Throughout the capital, crews were joined by volunteers and bystanders who used dogs, cameras, motion detectors and heat-seeking equipment to detect victims who may still be alive.Reinforcements began to arrive from countries including Panama, Israel and Chile, local media reported.In a statement, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) said it was sending a Disaster Assistance Response Team to help, at the request of the Mexican government.“The United States remains committed to helping our neighbours during this difficult time,” the statement said.US President Donald Trump spoke at length with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Wednesday, the White House said. On Tuesday, Trump had tweeted: “God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you.”Pena Nieto declared three days of mourning.“The priority continues to be rescuing people from collapsed buildings and taking care of the injured,” he said. “Every minute counts.”The president has been unusually visible since the two earthquakes, a sign of the political sensitivity of disaster relief less than a year before the next presidential election.The government’s widely panned response to the 1985 quake caused upheaval in Mexico, which some credited with weakening the 71-year rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Pena Nieto, the PRI’s first president since it lost power in 2000, hopes to elect a party successor next year.On Wednesday, the president travelled to the state of Morelos, just south of the capital, where 71 people died, to survey damage. In Puebla State, site of the earthquake’s epicentre, at least 43 died.The earthquake toppled dozens of buildings, tore gas mains and sparked fires across the city and other towns in central Mexico. Falling rubble and billboards crushed cars, and nearly 5 million homes, businesses and other facilities were without power at one point.Although authorities and property owners will need time to fully assess the damage, initial reports suggest that collapses were limited mostly to buildings that predated the 1985 quake, after which stricter building codes were enacted.But even wealthier parts of the capital, including the central Condesa and Roma neighbourhoods, were badly damaged as older buildings buckled. Because bedrock is uneven in a city built on a drained lake bed, some districts weather quakes better than others.”The central part of Mexico City, in the lake bed, is always going to be a complicated place to build,“ said Rodrigo Suarez, chief operating officer at Mexico City-based apartment developer Hasta Capital. ”These old buildings (may) survive an earthquake or two or three, but since they weren’t built to modern code, there’s always going to be a risk in major earthquakes.”In Puebla, some 100 miles (158 km) southwest of the capital, parts of colonial-era churches crumbled. In the town of Atzala, a row of coffins lined the street outside a church where the roof collapsed, killing 11 worshippers inside."
1193,"A corruption trial against Brazilian President Michel Temer moved one step closer Wednesday when the Supreme Court rejected a last-ditch attempt to have the case suspended.A 7-1 majority on the court voted against Temer's appeal to put the racketeering and obstruction of justice charges on hold, with three more justices still due to vote when the session was suspended.That clears the way for the case to be considered by the lower house of Congress in Latin America's biggest country.""It's up to the chamber of deputies now,"" said Justice Luis Roberto Barroso on casting his vote.If the chamber of deputies votes by a two thirds majority in favor, Temer -- the first sitting Brazilian president to face criminal charges -- would have to stand down for 180 days and face trial at the Supreme Court.However, the center-right president is confident he has enough support to easily defeat the charges, which are the peak in a mammoth graft scandal shaking the country. A first charge of bribe-taking in June was thrown out overwhelmingly by allied deputies.A first charge of bribe-taking in June was thrown out overwhelmingly by allied deputies.center-right president is confident he has enough support to easily defeat the charges, which are the peak in a mammoth graft scandal shaking the country. A first charge of bribe-taking in June was thrown out overwhelmingly by allied deputies.The latest charges involve Temer's alleged agreement to pay hush money to keep a jailed politician from testifying and his leadership of a group in Congress that took millions of dollars in bribes from companies seeking state contracts.His lawyers attempted to put the case on hold, arguing before the Supreme Court that one of the main pieces of evidence in the prosecution -- plea deal testimony from a meatpacking tycoon -- needs to be reconsidered because of irregularities.His lawyers also argue that some of the alleged crimes took place before he was sworn in as president last year, after replacing impeached president Dilma Rousseff.A review of the case might have suited Temer because the prosecutor general who brought the charges, Rodrigo Janot, stepped down at the end of last week. Janot was replaced by Raquel Dodge, whom analysts say may be less aggressive.At issue now is testimony given by JBS meatpacking magnates Joesley and Wesley Batista, who confessed to conducting wide ranging bribery of politicians and testified against Temer.Janot's charge against Temer illustrated the reach of Brazil's powerful prosecutors and judges in a three-year operation codenamed ""Car Wash,"" which has uncovered vast networks of bribery and embezzlement throughout Brazilian politics and business.According to the charges, Temer ""acted as leader of a criminal organization"" comprising senior officials from his center-right PMDB party. They allegedly took the kickbacks in exchange for contracts at public companies like oil giant Petrobras.The alleged ring operated from May 2016, when Temer first took over as acting president from leftist president Dilma Rousseff following her impeachment, Janot's office said.Temer called Janot's accusations ""absurd"" and accuses the prosecutor of overreach, -- an argument that has some sympathy in Congress, where scores of legislators are also accused of corruption.Although Temer is expected to survive the congressional vote on a trial, he could still face prosecution after leaving office. His term ends at the start of 2019 and he is not expected to run for another term in October 2018 elections.Also, his reputation is in tatters. Among those charged with him last week were his chief of staff Eliseu Padilha and Moreira Franco, a close confidant who holds a ministerial level administrative post in the presidency.Another was a former minister, Geddel Vieira Lima, who was imprisoned this month after police discovered the equivalent of $16 million in cash stuffed into boxes and suitcases in an apartment he used."

1199,"Ex-CIA agent John Nixon has said that former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was telling the truth during the interrogation that he did not have any weapons of mass destruction.In an interview with BBC, Nixon —who was the first person to interrogate Saddam at length —said that former Iraqi President was the most ""secretive and suspicious"" man he has ever met.“At first he was much more in control then I thought for someone who just had his world rocked upside down. He acted as if US military — who were his captors — was his guest”, Nixon said during the interview.He said that the Washington wanted to know a number of things and the number one question was where are the weapons of mass destruction.“He said that he didn’t have any (weapons of mass destruction) and didn’t have any weapons program and he didn’t intend to start one. I was wary at first on what he was saying but when we talked to other members of the nuclear program, we began to find that he was telling the truth”, ex-CIA agent said.Nixon said he is ""ashamed"" of what has happened in Iraq since the ousting of Saddam Hussein.He said the Bush administration gave no thought as to what events might take place after Saddam's removal, and - in light of the rise of extremist groups such as Daesh - believes the region would have been better off had he remained in place.Saddam was captured in December 2003 after a US-led invasion toppled his government and pushed Iraq into chaos, resulting in years of deadly sectarian violence and the rise of al Qaeda in Iraq, a precursor of the extremist group now known as Daesh."

1201,"NEW DELHI: Mahendra Singh Dhoni quit as India´s limited-overs captain Wednesday after a decade-long spell as skipper in which he led his team to victory in the ODI and T20 World Cups.The Indian board said the inspirational wicketkeeping batsman would still be available for selection for the upcoming series against England but did not say who would replace him as captain.""Mahendra Singh Dhoni has informed the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) that he wishes to step down as the captain of the Indian Cricket Team from the One Day Internationals and the T20 Internationals formats of the game,"" said a statement.""On behalf of every Indian cricket fan and the BCCI, I would like to thank MS Dhoni for his outstanding contribution as the captain of the Indian team across all formats,"" added board chief executive Rahul Johri.""Under his leadership, the Indian team has touched new heights and his achievements will remain etched forever in the annals of Indian cricket.""He is expected to be succeeded by Virat Kohli, who took over as Test skipper after Dhoni retired from five-day matches in December 2014.During his spell in charge of the limited-overs side, Dhoni captained India to victory in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa.His finest hour came four years later when the team won the 50 overs World Cup against Sri Lanka on home turf.However, his position had come under scrutiny more recently after India were knocked out of last year´s World T20 in the semi-final despite being favourites as tournament hosts.A former ticket inspector on India´s railways, Dhoni made his international debut in December 2004 and soon established a reputation for his flamboyant stroke playing, in particular, his trademark ""helicopter"" shot.In one of his first international appearances in April 2005, he smashed 148 off 123 balls against old foes Pakistan in Visakhapatnam.He made his Test debut later that year in Chennai, the first of 90 Tests in which he scored 4,876 runs at an average of just over 38. His 27 victories in charge of the Test team is a record for an Indian captain.His swashbuckling style and leadership qualities soon earned him the captaincy of India´s T20 team after senior players like Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar opted out of the first ever T20 World Cup in 2007.His success in South Africa landed him the job as captain of the ODI side and he built a reputation over the years for an ice-cold temperament.Despite his team´s disappointing showing in last year´s T20 World Cup, Dhoni voiced confidence he would still be fit enough to play in the next 50 over World Cup in England in 2019.He has so far played 283 ODIs, with a batting average of nearly 51 while he has also appeared in 73 T20 internationals."
1202,"An Israeli soldier who shot dead a wounded and incapacitated Palestinian in the occupied West Bank was convicted of manslaughter on Wednesday in one of the most divisive trials in Israel's history.Hundreds of far-right protesters rallied in support of Sergeant Elor Azaria along a busy Tel Aviv street and some clashed with police outside an army base where the lengthy verdict was read out.Despite a campaign by Azaria's family and rightist politicians criticising the armed forces for putting him on trial, members of Israel's military establishment argued that shooting in violation of regulations could not be countenanced.A three-judge military court rejected the 20-year-old conscript's arguments that he acted in self-defence.The shooting was caught on video by a Palestinian rights activist, and the footage, distributed to news organisations, ensured the incident drew international attention.Reading for 2-1/2 hours from the verdict, chief judge Colonel Maya Heller said Azaria shot the Palestinian out of revenge in March 2016 after the assailant allegedly stabbed and wounded a fellow soldier in the West Bank town of Hebron.""He deserves to die,"" Azaria was quoted in the verdict as telling another soldier, just after fatally shooting the Palestinian in the head as the man, who had been wounded minutes earlier by Israeli military gunfire, lay motionless in the street.""One cannot use this type of force, even if we're talking about an enemy's life,"" the court said in its verdict. ""We unanimously convict the accused of manslaughter and of conduct unbecoming (a soldier).""Sentencing will be handed down at a later date. Politicians from right-wing parties have already called on President Reuven Rivlin to pardon the soldier, who has been dubbed ""everyone's child"" by the campaign supporting him.The manslaughter charge carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment."
1203,"NEW YORK: A New York City train derailed after ramming into a bumper at a downtown Brooklyn terminal during Wednesday's morning rush hour, injuring more than 100 commuters in the metropolitan area's second major rail accident since late September.Emergency crews swarmed Atlantic Terminal after the Long Island Railroad train went off the tracks inside the busy transportation hub at about 8:30 a.m. local time, the New York City Fire Department said.While none of the injuries were life-threatening, at least 11 people were sent to the hospital, Deputy Assistant Chief Dan Donoghue said at a briefing at the crash site.The train, arriving from the Queens neighbourhood of Far Rockaway, failed to stop on time and struck a bumping block at a fairly low rate of speed, which caused it to derail, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at the briefing.About 103 people were injured in the accident, the fire department said in a Twitter message. The front two cars of the six-carriage train were severely damaged.The engineer was probably responsible for failing to stop the train before it hit the bumper, said Tom Prendergast, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that runs the LIRR.""At that speed, it's pretty much the locomotive engineer's responsibility to stop the train,"" Prendergast said as he stood beside Cuomo at the briefing.In late September, a New Jersey Transit train crashed into a terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey, killing one woman and injuring 114 people, including the engineer.Cuomo, who has made infrastructure improvements a centerpiece of his agenda, said Wednesday's incident was minor in comparison. The most serious injury in the crash was a broken leg, he said.""There was an extensive damage in Hoboken,"" Cuomo said. ""That train was coming in much faster, did much more damage.""In Brooklyn, commuters described a frightening and chaotic scene on social media. ""People flying everywhere,"" Serena Janae, who said she was a passenger on the derailed train, wrote on Facebook.The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said they were sending investigators to the scene.The Long Island Railroad is the United State's largest commuter rail system, serving more than 330,000 passengers a day, according to the American Public Transportation Association.Atlantic Terminal, which also connects commuters to nine city subway lines, is one of the busiest New York stations.There were no major service disruptions for other Long Island Railroad lines at the terminal, an MTA official said.Earlier, officials said crews were working to restore service at the terminal by the evening rush hour.   "
1204,"LONDON: In-form midfielder Dele Alli scored two near-identical headers as Tottenham Hotspur beat Chelsea 2-0 on Wednesday to torpedo the Premier League leaders' hopes of a record 14th consecutive victory.Chelsea were bidding to become the first team to win 14 successive games within the same English top-flight season, but Alli's goals, both set up by Christian Eriksen, brought them down to earth.Antonio Conte's Chelsea must content themselves with having equalled Arsenal's season record of 13 wins in a row from 2002 and they remain five points clear of second-place Liverpool.But the end of their winning streak will give hope to their pursuers, not least Tottenham, who rose above Manchester City and Arsenal to third place in the table, seven points below the leaders.Alli, 20, has now scored a brace in three successive games and his latest double allowed Mauricio Pochettino's men to register a fifth win in a row -- their best such run in nearly a year.It also enabled Spurs to claim a measure of revenge, both for their 2-1 defeat at Chelsea in November and the fiery 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge last May that ended their title challenge.Pochettino, meanwhile, could celebrate his 150th Premier League game as a manager with a deeply satisfying victory.Whereas Spurs had gone with four at the back in November's 2-1 loss at the Bridge, here they effectively matched Chelsea's 3-4-3 shape, which made for an attritional first half at White Hart Lane.Spurs saw most of the ball, their wing-backs Kyle Walker and Danny Rose carrying the fight, but they struggled to pick holes in Chelsea's rearguard and the visitors posed a threat on the break.Carbon copyIn the fifth minute, Nemanja Matic's lofted pass over Spurs' right-sided centre-back Eric Dier found Eden Hazard in ample space, only for the Belgian to shoot narrowly wide with his left foot.Victor Wanyama and Eriksen sent low efforts wide from range for Spurs and when the hosts finally got in behind, Dier ghosting in to meet Rose's deep free-kick, Thibaut Courtois was on hand to save.But in first-half injury time, Spurs struck, Eriksen shaping a cross into the box from the right and Alli, hitherto close to anonymous, leaping to plant a glorious header in the top-right corner.It was the England midfielder's sixth goal in four games and within nine minutes of kick-off in the second half, he would have a seventh.Urged on by a typically animated Conte, Chelsea flew out of the traps, Diego Costa testing Hugo Lloris with a skidding strike and Hazard nodding Marcos Alonso's header wide from point-blank range.The celebrations, though, were Tottenham's thanks to a near carbon copy of their first goal, Eriksen swinging a cross to the back post and Alli outleaping Victor Moses and Cesar Azpilicueta to head home.Conte made three bold changes, sending on Willian, Cesc Fabregas and Michy Batshuayi for Marcos Alonso, N'Golo Kante and Moses, with Pedro Rodriguez moving to a left wing-back role.But his players, finally, appeared spent and Eriksen came close to adding a third with a dipping free-kick that narrowly eluded the left-hand upright."

Today is a day of celebration for the entire country,” said 41-year-old Gaber Fathy.The raucous mood spilling out on the streets marked a respite for Egyptians after years of hardship, from IMF-backed austerity reforms that have pushed inflation to record highs to a tough law on protests that has made public gatherings exceedingly rare after two presidents were toppled since a 2011 uprising.“You can look around and see how people are happy. This is something you never witness in Egypt,” said 23-year-old Gamal Mohamed in downtown Cairo’s Tahrir Square, the iconic centre of the country’s once-active protest movement, which has since been quashed by tough security measures.Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi congratulated the Egyptian people after the match as tireless fans draped in flags turned the streets into an impromptu parade of red, white and black.Just across the border in neighbouring Gaza, where Egypt has led a political reconciliation process, thousands of Palestinians poured into an open-air park to cheer on the second Arab country to qualify for the 2018 World Cup after Saudi Arabia."
1209,"ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) arrested Captain (retd) Safdar, the son-in-law of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, from outside Islamabad airport, shortly after he returned from London along with his wife Maryam Nawaz late Sunday.A six-member NAB team waited outside Rawal lounge of the airport for the arrest of Capt (retd) Safdar, as the airport authorities stopped them from entering the lounge.Safdar's arrest came minutes after Maryam Nawaz left the airport premises alone amid cheers by scores of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) workers, who gathered outside the airport.Maryam, after having left the airport, arrived at the residence of Chaudhry Muneer - her daughter's father-in-law - in Islamabad's F-6 sector, Geo News learnt.A number of PML-N leaders including Asif Kirmani, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Marvi Memon, Maiza Hameed and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry were also present at the airport.Around 1000 police, FC personnel will be deployed for security during the hearingThe PML-N activists protested against the arrest of Captain (retd) Safdar outside the airport. They chanted slogans in favour of the party leadership and kept the way for the vehicle, in which Safdar was being taken to NAB's regional office in Islamabad, blocked for quite some time.The workers seemed adamant not to let the vehicle pass through, despite repeated calls by the party leaders present on the spot. Raged activists thumped the vehicle repeatedly, while a few also laid down before it.They, however, backed off after PML-N leader Dr. Asif Kirmani conveyed leadership's directives to them to not block the way of NAB officials.Confirming the arrest of Safdar, Kirmani said Maryam Nawaz and Captain (retd) Safdar came as per the schedule, adding that Maryam Nawaz left the airport premises, while Captain (retd) Safdar was taken into custody by NAB officials.""He [Safdar] is in high spirits,"" the PML-N leader said, while speaking to Geo News. ""I kept discussing Begum Kulsoom Nawaz's health with him.""He said they didn't call the workers, and the activists came to the airport out of their own will. ""I tried to convince them, but we get to see some emotional scenes in such cases. However, they left the way open for NAB officials after being apprised of the leadership's directives.""Asked about their next course of action, Kirmani said they would take whatever legal way they found.It has been learnt that Safdar will remain under custody of the NAB until he is presented before the accountability court on Monday morning.It is pertinent to note here on October 2, Judge Mohammad Bashir of the accountability court, while hearing corruption references against the Sharif family, had issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Safdar, Hussain Nawaz and Hasan Nawaz, and bailable warrants for Maryam.Given the non-bailable arrest warrants, the anti-graft body had decided to arrest Safdar upon reaching Islamabad airport, according to sources. A special cell was also vacated for him at the NAB's Rawalpindi office.He was however whisked to the NAB office in Islamabad, following his somewhat difficult arrest from outside the airport.Earlier while referring to corruption references filed against them, Maryam Nawaz said the world knows this isn't accountability, however, added that she would appear before the court to ""try the justice system"".She was speaking to Geo News outside the Sharif family’s Avenfield residence in London before leaving for Heathrow airport on Sunday. The former first daughter said the so-called accountability process underway for the last year-and-a-half has been exposed as the world is aware now that this [corruption cases] is not for justice but for revenge.“However, we are going back and will appear before the court and get through the wheels of justice. We respect the rule of law and the Constitution,” she said, adding that when one’s intentions are clear, he or she isn’t afraid of going anywhere.Responding to a question, Maryam said her brothers Hussain and Hasan will present themselves before the court too but did not give a date for their appearance.Commenting on Nawaz’s recent re-election as the head of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Maryam said, “it is surprising if anyone has issues with him becoming the PML-N president. God has given him a respectable position that politics revolve around him. The PML-N has a democratic right to elect as its president whoever it wants.She added that, “God willing, the 2018 elections will be held on time and a democratic government will complete its tenure and pass on the baton to the next.”Speaking to Geo News, Maryam’s husband, MNA Capt (retd) Safdar, said they have held legal consultations with their lawyers and everything is finalised in this regard. “We will face courts and not run away,” said the National Assembly Member from Mansehra.The couple will take a Qatar Airways flight from London and reach Islamabad early Monday morning.Both have been summoned, along with Nawaz Sharif and sons, by the Islamabad Accountability Court on Monday.Maryam and Safdar face a corruption reference related to the Sharif family’s Avenfield properties in London. Her brothers and father, however, face a total of three cases, including the Avenfield case, filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in an accountability court.The PIA London-bound flight was delayed for one hourThey include the Azizia Steel Mills reference and offshore companies'.The cases were filed after the directions of the Supreme Court in its July 28 Panama Papers case judgment.At the last hearing on October 2, Judge Mohammad Bashir issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Safdar, Hussain and Hasan and bailable warrants for Maryam. Nawaz has been appearing before the court since it began its proceedings. However, at present Nawaz is in London to spend time with his wife, Kulsoom, who is undergoing treatment for lymphoma. It is unclear when the former premier will return. The court is yet to decide on his plea for exemption from appearance. NAB had in total filed three references against the Sharif family and one against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in the accountability court, in light of the Supreme Court's orders in the Panama Papers case verdict of July 28.Accountability Court-I adjourns hearing of three corruption cases against Sharifs until October 9The anti-graft body was given six weeks, from the date of the apex court's order, to file the reference in an accountability court while the accountability court was granted six months to wrap up the proceedings.The references against the Sharif family pertain to the Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metals Establishment, their London properties and over a dozen offshore companies.NAB's Rawalpindi branch prepared two references regarding the Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metals Establishment, and the nearly dozen companies owned by the Sharif family.Its Lahore branch prepared a reference on the Sharif family's Avenfield apartments in London and another against Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for owning assets beyond his known sources of income.If convicted, the accused may face up to 14 years imprisonment and lifelong disqualification from holding public office including the freezing of bank accounts and assets."
1210,"BERLIN: German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats (CDU) reached a deal on migrant policy with her conservative Bavarian allies on Sunday, removing a major obstacle to pursuing talks on a coalition with other parties.In an apparent concession, Merkel agreed to put a number on how many people Germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds, namely a net total of around 200,000 individuals.The CDU and Christian Social Union (CSU) reached the migrant deal after about seven hours of talks and later adjourned their meeting. It was unclear whether they had agreed on other issues, such as Europe and pensions. Further details will be made available at a news conference on Monday.Merkel won a fourth term as chancellor in a Sept. 24 election but was weakened by heavy losses to the far right.She wants to build a coalition between her conservative bloc and two other parties, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens, which are far apart on issues from tax and energy to Europe.First, however, she must get her own house in order and overcome some major differences between her CDU and the CSU, its sister party in Bavaria, a state that accounts for 15 percent of Germany’s population.The two parties have formed a parliamentary bloc together for decades, but have diverged over migrant policy since Merkel left the border open to a huge wave of migrants in 2015, most of whom entered the country through Bavaria.The CSU has demanded a cap on refugees, but Merkel has resisted that, arguing it would breach Germany’s constitution, which guarantees the right of asylum to anyone facing political persecution.Under the face-saving compromise brokered on Sunday, Germany would accept a net of about 200,000 people a year on humanitarian grounds, including families of refugees already in Germany. Authorities will not turn people away at the border, however, and the parties avoided using the term “upper limit” that Merkel has consistently rejected.“We want to achieve a total number of people taken in for humanitarian reasons (refugees and asylum seekers, those entitled to subsidiary protection, family members, relocation and resettlement minus deportations and voluntary departures of future refugees) that does not exceed 200,000 people a year,” states the agreement.The leaders also agreed they wanted to set up centres where asylum seekers would stay until decisions on their applications were made. Rejected asylum seekers would be returned to their home countries.They also agreed to declare Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia as countries of safe origin, meaning Germany can return rejected asylum seekers there more easily.“It is a good day for the conservatives and a good day for Germany,” CSU General Secretary Andreas Scheuer said after the talks.Setting a number is a climbdown for Merkel and may not be acceptable to the Greens.“This is an agreement between the CDU and CSU and far from the result of exploratory talks for a coalition with the FDP and Greens,” said Greens co-leader Simone Peter.The target looks achievable, however, given that the number of people arriving in Germany fell to about 280,000 last year from 890,000 in 2015. A further drop is expected this year.In addition, the two parties agreed to push for an immigration law that would give priority to migrants with skills to plug gaps in the labour market. There is broad support for that from the FDP and Greens.Fearing heavy losses to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in a state election next year, the CSU has dug in its heels on the issue of a cap to the number of migrants.The stakes are high for the CSU’s combative leader, Horst Seehofer, who is fighting for his political survival after a poor election performance. The CSU slumped to 6.2 percent, measured nationally, from 7.4 percent in 2013.Once the CDU and CSU have agreed on all their policies, they can start exploratory talks with the FDP and Greens.It could still take months to get a full coalition deal and investors are concerned about the prospect of a policy standstill in Europe’s biggest economy. If no deal is reached, the prospect looms of either a minority government or new elections."
1211,"LONDON: Senior PTI leader Jahangir Khan Tareen and Imran Khan’s businessman friend Zulfi Bukhari managed to obtain the full Panama file and some of the pages from this file have been now presented before the Supreme Court of Pakistan as “evidence” allegedly proving Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s status as the “beneficial owner” of the offshore companies Nescoll and Nielson.Two forensic accountancy and search firms called Ereco and Kroll were hired by Zulfi and Tareen in the last two months, a trusted PTI source told The News. The PTI source told that these firms were able to share “around 45,000 different documents with Tareen and Zulfi on this matter”.  The source said that “thousands of Pounds” were paid in the fees but didn’t reveal the exact amount. PTI leader Jahangir Khan Tareen spent a week here towards the end of December 2016 and he and Zulfi Bukhari worked together to get this file from their sources in British Virgin Islands (BVI), a PTI insider confirmed to The News.It’s understood that Zulfi Bukhari has been trying through his contacts in the BVI and New Jeresy Island to collect anything that could cause legal trouble for the Sharif family members. Zulfi Bukhari himself knows about the offshore business in great detail since his name was not only released in Panama leaks but its been established that he owns around half a dozen offshore shells directly and in the name of his close family members.The PTI source told The News that the “professional advice” helped the party to get hold of the papers unseen before and Imran Khan has been very happy seeing the emails exchanges. He told a news conference that the latest “evidence” is concrete but PMLN has countered that the “unverified” and “photocopied” papers cannot be considered as evidence admissible in a court of law.Whether or not the latest few pages will lead to anything incriminating will be seen in coming days but there is no doubt that the PTI leaders were seen jubilant after getting hold of these papers. Earlier during the hearing by the SC, PTI’s legal team was roasted in the court room and the PTI’s arguments and legal defence became a matter of jokes as against all the tall claims the PTI couldn’t produce a single piece of evidence proving money-laundering by the Sharif family.The News revealed how Zulfi, JKT and Aleem Khan had promised to hire forensic experts but then went quiet for many months. It’s understood that in the last two months, contact was made with at least three forensic experts with whom Imran Khan, Aleem Khan and JKT had held first meeting at Zulfi Bukhari’s office in April last year. Jahangir Tareen, Aleem Khan and Zulfi Bukhari control properties through offshore companies and Imran Khan also owned an offshore company called “Niazi Services Limited”.The new Supreme Court bench started hearing into the Panama case yesterday relying mainly on the “new” evidence as the so-called evidence presented earlier was described as “heaps of worthless papers” during the court proceedings.The latest “evidence” relates to a series of emails exchanged between Mossack Fonseca and Minerva Trust & Corporation Services Limited as well as replies to the Financial investigation agency FIA of the BVI apparently showing that Maryam Safdar was the beneficial owner of Nescoll and Nielson companies. PMLN has rubbished the documents as unverified and unauthentic.PTI has claimed that the series of emails collectively reaffirms and establishes that, contrary to the stance of Maryam Safdar before the top court in previous hearings, she is and has been the beneficial owner of Nielsen and Nescoll and the Mayfair flats.According to documents, Mossack on 14 May 2012 received a letter from the FIA which was then forwarded internally for action within Mossack on the instructions of its Managing Director (MD) by the Compliance Department of Mossack.To entertain the queries, head of Compliance Department emailed Minerva for the information required as part of ‘internal audit.’ The Head of Compliance of Mossack requested information including name, contacts details, physical address and passport copy of the ultimate beneficial owner of the companies, Nescoll and Nielson, from Minerva, the document stated. It further stated that the email also requested information about the directors and shareholders of above mentioned entities along with the name of any trustee connected with these entities."

An older version of the medicine with an additional ingredient has been used as far back as the 1950s.For the current study, researchers reviewed data from a decades-old trial and found little evidence that the medicine is effective, said study co-author Dr. Navindra Persaud, a researcher at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto in Canada.“This medication is recommended as the first-line treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy,” Persaud said by email. “We now have more information about this 1970s study that should make us question whether this medication should have been approved and whether it was ever proven to be effective.”The original trial in the 1970s was designed to determine if the drug could alleviate morning sickness in the first trimester of pregnancy.To see if those results proved the drug effective, Persaud and co-author Dr. Rujun Zhang of the University of Toronto examined 36,000 pages of documents from the US Food and Drug Administration, including the original study report, the protocol and summary results, and other documents from Health Canada.About 2,300 pregnant women participated in the original trial at 14 clinics in the US, the researchers found. All of the women were experiencing nausea and vomiting in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.Women were randomly assigned to eight treatment groups, including one that received a placebo or dummy pill and seven that received a variety of drugs including the combination currently sold as Diclectin.Each participant was asked to take two tablets a day at bedtime and one additional pill in the afternoon as needed for one week.Based on data from 1,599 women who completed the study, participants were 14 percent more likely to report treatment was moderate or excellent with Diclectin than with placebo, the new analysis found.But this finding may not be reliable because the final study results aren’t available and 37 percent of participants in the placebo group dropped out before the study ended, researchers note in the current analysis.In the new analysis, researchers also couldn’t see how physicians scored symptoms. And, data for 30 patients recruited in the original trial were excluded from analysis by regulators because there were data recorded without a record of patient visits, the new study notes.Persaud wasn’t able to contact any of the original researchers, and many of them may have died.Still, Persaud said women prescribed this drug should stop taking it and speak to their doctors about other options to treat morning sickness.But not all doctors agree with this assessment.“Studies that have been done since this trial was completed in the 1970s show that doxylamine and pyridoxine are an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy,” said Dr. Siripanth Nippita, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who wasn’t involved in the current analysis.“Based on research involving over 200,000 women, we can say that doxylamine and pyridoxine are safe to take during pregnancy,” Nippita added by email. “They can be an important part of treatment for nausea and vomiting.” "
1213,"PARIS: A mysterious type of radio wave from deep space, discovered only a decade ago, has been traced to a precise source for the first time, astronomers said Wednesday.So-called fast radio bursts (FRBs) picked up in 2016 by a telescope in New Mexico likely emanated from a dwarf galaxy some three billion light years from Earth, the scientists reported in the journal Nature. FRBs flash only for a micro-instant, and can emit as much energy in a millisecond as the Sun does in 10,000 years.Exactly what causes these high-energy surges of long waves at the far end of the electromagnetic spectrum remains the subject of intense debate. The new discovery will not settle the issue, but it definitively eliminates several theories that had been in the running, scientists said.There have been 18 fast radio bursts registered since 2007, but only one -- observed in 2012 at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, and dubbed FRB 121102 -- recurred numerous times.That prompted a team of scientists led by Shami Chatterjee of Cornell University to prepare in case it happened again. The idea paid off: in 83 hours of observation over six months, the Karl G. Jansky multi-antenna array of radio telescopes -- more powerful than any to have spotted a FRB in the past -- detected nine distinct pulses.""We now know that this particular burst comes from a dwarf galaxy more than three billion light years from Earth,"" Chatterjee said in a statement.The discovery does not answer the core question of what produces these strange emanations that long escaped the notice of professional star-gazers.""Still, even without a clear answer, the finding is a real game-changer,"" said Heino Falcke, an astronomer at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands who was not involved in the research. 'Not in our backyard' Until recently, many experts speculated that FRBs are produced by cataclysmic events such as stars exploding into supernovas, or neutron stars collapsing into black holes.While it is possible that these one-off scenarios also produce such bursts, all of them are inconsistent with multiple pulses such as those generated by FRB 121102.The new data also dispels another widely discussed possibility, explained Shriharsh Tendulkar, a scientist at McGill University in Montreal.""Before we knew the distance to any FRBs, several proposed explanations for their origins said they could be coming from within, or near, our own Milky Way,"" he said. Such a close source can now be ruled out -- at least in this case.""It´s not something in our backyard,"" said co-author Casey Law, an astronomer at the University of California in Berkeley.That still leaves plenty of room for speculation.One of the top candidates, the astronomers suggested, is a neutron star -- possibly a type known as a magnetar -- surrounded by material ejected by a supernova explosion.A neutron star -- small but extremely dense -- is formed by the gravitational collapse of a star not quite massive enough to produce a black hole when it explodes. A magnetar is a type of neutron star with an extremely powerful magnetic field."
1214,"KARACHI: Senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Asad Umar was shifted to a hospital in the wee hours of Thursday, informed his party`s spokesperson.MPA Khurram Sherzaman said that Umar, after arriving at Karachi`s Jinnah International Airport from Islamabad, was immediately taken to a private hospital as he was facing severe headache due to high blood pressure. However, according to the family sources, Umar, at the present time, is not seriously ill and it is nothing severe.Asad Umar resigned as CEO of Engro Corporation on 19 April 2012 and joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. He was elected as a Member of the National Assembly of Pakistan for NA-48 Islamabad in a 2013 by-election"
1215,"WELLINGTON: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is set to approve plans for its long-awaited World Test Championship at a meeting in New Zealand this week, it was reported Monday.The sport´s governing body has argued for years that a Test championship is needed to boost the five-day format´s popularity as crowds and television viewers flock to the big-hitting Twenty20 version of the game.But squabbling over formats and fears that some nations will be disadvantaged have twice stymied efforts to launch a league structure since 2010.The Sydney Morning Herald reported that plans for a nine-nation Test championship were now well advanced and the ICC was set to give the concept a green light on Friday at a meeting in Auckland.It said the first edition of the competition would run over a two-year cycle beginning in 2019, culminating in a final between the top two teams at Lord´s.Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said the league competition would give Test series a broader international ""context"", making them more than stand-alone bilateral contests.""You´re also creating structure in such a way that you no longer have games without meaning. They are all part of a league championship,"" he told the Herald.Purists view Test cricket as the pinnacle of the sport but it has struggled, particularly in Asia, as lucrative T20 competitions such as the Indian Premier League have caught the public´s imagination.A recent innovation designed to reverse the trend is the introduction of day-night Test matches, which moves playing sessions to more spectator-friendly hours.The idea of four-day Test matches has also been floated, although traditionalists oppose the move.The Herald reported that the ICC will also look at a major shake-up of one-day international fixtures at the Auckland meeting.It said a 13-nation ODI league was being considered, which would operate on a three-year cycle with results affecting World Cup qualification.Under the plans, the number of ODIs in a series would be capped at three, ending the lengthy five-match series that are currently part of the international fixture list."
1216,"Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles (55 km per hour) as it moved northeast into Alabama, prompting the National Hurricane Centre to end its tropical storm warnings for the region.The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the centre. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. “We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” he said.Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the US South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and the southern United States.The tropical depression’s centre will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the National Hurricane Centre said. Heavy rainfall and storm surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the centre said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.Nate made its first US landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot.Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 metre) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry.Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate.But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges.US President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 are still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.Alabama Power said it has restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it.Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches, was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane centre said.Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.“I had prayed for this - that we would be spared,” said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent to a county.Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon.The Port of New Orleans reopened, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Refineries and port authorities in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were reviewing when they could reopen.The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.Workers were evacuated from 301 platforms and 13 rigs as of Saturday, said the US Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador."
1217,"DUBAI: Paceman Wahab Riaz took three wickets in a fiery spell but Sri Lanka were still in the driving seat after the third day of the second day-night Test in Dubai on Sunday.Riaz grabbed 3-10 to derail Sri Lanka´s second innings -- 34-5 at close -- but the visitors were still in a strong position with an overall lead of 254 runs with five wickets intact.Riaz dismissed Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal leg before for nought in the last over before close to give Pakistan a faint hope of upsetting the tables, but it will be an uphill task for their faltering batsmen to improve in the second innings.Pakistan were dismissed for 262 in their first innings, conceding a big 220-run lead following Sri Lanka´s first innings 482.It was paceman Mohammad Abbas who started the slide, having opener Kaushal Silva caught behind for three before Riaz dismissed first innings centurion Dimuth Karunaratne for seven.He then had debutant Sadeera Samarawickrama out for 13 in a hostile spell of 3.3 overs. Leg-spinner Yasir Shah had nightwatchman Suranga Lakmal out for one as Pakistan started to stage a fightback.At close Kusal Mendis was unbeaten on eight.Sri Lankan spinners Dilruwan Perera (3-72) and Rangana Herath (3-84) had bundled Pakistan out just after dinner to put Sri Lanka in sight of a series win.They won the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi.Only Azhar Ali (59) and Haris Sohail (56) offered some resistance as the Pakistani batsmen once again flopped on a batting friendly Dubai Stadium pitch, losing their last six wickets for 82 runs.It was 21 runs short of the follow-on mark but Sri Lanka did not enforce it.Ali and Sohail lifted Pakistan from a precarious 109-4 during a battling fifth-wicket stand of 71, but once Ali was gone the innings unfolded.Herath trapped Ali leg-before and reviewed it to overturn a not-out decision, triggering the collapse. Ali hit six boundaries in his patient knock.Sohail was the eighth wicket to fall, trapped in front by Perera to end any hopes of Pakistan reaching a respectable total. He smashed four boundaries and two sixes. Skipper Sarfraz Ahmed made 14 before he miscued a sweep and was caught off Perera.When Pakistan resumed at 51-0, paceman Lahiru Gamage who took his first wicket in Test cricket, bowling Shan Masood through the gate after the opener had made 16.Sami Aslam was trapped leg before by Perera for 39 to leave Pakistan two down with 65 runs on the board.Asad Shafiq fell for 12 when he edged Lakmal to slip to continue his wretched form in the series. Babar Azam made eight.Lakmal finished with 2-41 while Gamage had figures of 2-38."
1218,"A man in China's southern region of Guangxi wounded 11 children with a blade at their kindergarten on Wednesday, state television said, in the country's latest mass knifing incident.Violent crime is rare in China, compared to many other countries, but there has been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children.China Central Television said in a post on its official microblog that a man climbed the wall of the kindergarten in the city of Pingxiang and attacked the students.All of the wounded children had been sent to the hospital but their injuries were not life-threatening, CCTV said.It said the suspect had been detained by police and the incident was being investigated, but did not give his full name."
1219,"Pakistani security agencies have done a remarkable job as far as war against terrorism is concerned, but there are areas where we have not done enough and also areas where we have not made any progress at all. Areas like political and economic stability, in education and health sectors as well.Jhal Magsi blast at a shrine was just a reminder of the areas which need to be addressed more seriously. Jhal Magsi blast, second on the same shrine in three years, and the biggest blast since devastating blast at Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, clearly indicates that we have not done enough to protect shrines.Instead of addressing these issues of serious nature, our policymakers looked confused and self-contradicting. Even the top leaders of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N), like Foreign Minister Khwaja Mohammad Asif and former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan gave contradictory statements over the US demand of ‘do more’. Only through unity, you can win the war.Pakistan should be proud of its efforts and the international community needs to appreciate the role played by Pakistan Army in the war against terrorism from 2002 to 2017. It would be unjust not to give credit to the political leadership, whether under former president Asif Ali Zardari or former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for making national consensus on these operations, from Swat to North Waziristan.Massacre of children at Army Public School Peshawar had practically shaken the nation that Pakistan has left with no other option but to completely eradicate terrorism and those local and global networks which have made our soil a safe haven.Pakistan has already paid heavy price even more than any other country in the world for its role in war against terrorism. Not only loss of over 70,000 people including over 20,000 security personnel and officers, but also lost a former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Head of the state, former president General (retd) Pervez Musharraf and head of the government, former premier Shaukat Aziz survived suicide attacks. Even political parties like Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F), Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and Awami National Party (ANP) in particular also paid heavy price. Parties like the PPP, ANP and MQM could not campaign for 2013 elections after series of attacks on their leaders.But, Pakistan as a nation showed strong resolve to fight terrorism and even the strongest critics like Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan backed the operation after the APS Peshawar attack.With the war still far from over, it would also be an understatement if we say, “We have done enough.” No, neither we have done enough nor the world has done enough. In fact, the US-led coalition because of its 15 years old policies has escalated the war and both terrorism and extremism, in particular, have increased since 9/11. What happened in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, in no way had helped.Therefore, the world particularly the US needs to do more, to correct its historic wrong, when it came to overall review of policies from Middle East to Afghanistan, from Iraq to Syria. This dose not mean that this war is over for Pakistan. Rising extremism had threatened our society and we are still confused over our possible counter-narrative. Both civil and military leadership have to sit together to take some bold decision as to how to address the issue of rising influence of non-state actors, in our society.Where we need to do more are areas like providing speedy and early justice system, massive reforms in education sector on war footing, developing public schooling culture instead of private education, revolutionary reforms in the health sector to uplift government hospital. There is also a need for social and cultural revolution, promotion of sports at all levels and healthy extracurricular activities.All this is only possible in a stable political and economic system, something which we are seriously lacking at the moment. Political and economic instability often leads to confusion and uncertainty in the country.Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal's emotional speech in the National Assembly may have a lot of substance in it, but the government won't react, they act. If all this is happening under his nose, it is his responsibility to take action. What he has said had been said by successive rulers in the recent past, but through half-hearted action, the government would not be able to tackle this grave situation.Two important developments have taken place in the last two weeks. Successful visit of army chief, General Qamar Bajwa to Afghanistan, his meeting with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and equally important visit of Foreign Minister Khwaja Mohammad Asif to the US, second in few weeks. Pakistan's civil and military leadership have to take some key decision in the backdrop of the existing tension between Pakistan and US, particularly over Afghanistan.Soon after his return from Kabul, army chief presided over all-important meeting of the Corps Commanders, which lasted for seven hours. Unlike in the past no, official press release by the ISPR was released but, sources said, the meeting discussed the prevailing external and internal security matters. After Pakistan's initial reaction over the changing US policy towards Afghanistan and demand for 'do more; and Pakistan's response.Foreign Minister Khwaja Asif, who has faced criticism from certain section of society over his recent comments during an interview regarding Pakistan's efforts and demand for 'do more,' left for US to meet high US official at the Ministerial level. This visit has taken place weeks after Pakistan decline to meet top US official in Islamabad, in what said to be a soft dissent from Pakistan over the recent remarks of US President Donald Trump, followed by a drone attack.Pakistan's major concern towards the changing US position has been the Indian influence on the US in dealing with Pakistan as in relation to Afghanistan. This perhaps, would not be acceptable to Pakistan and the visit of the army chief to Afghanistan and Khwaja Asif to US, apparently for the same purpose.Pakistan's biggest dilemma in this long war against terrorism has been our confusion over the manner in which this difficult non-conventional war should be fought.We were confused when we entered in this war against terrorism, and we are confused today, after 16 years or more. Yes, we had done a lot, perhaps more than any other country, but if this war is not yet over and needs years to reach any conclusion, there is always a need to do more, not only for Pakistan but for the world. The way forward for us is to remove the basic confusion in ourselves about this war and extremism, which has threatened our society.If our policymakers remain confused and political leadership, public opinion divided, we would not be able to remove the confusion of others. Therefore, there is a need for civil and military leadership to come on one page, and remove basic confusion in our fight against terrorism and more difficult challenge of extremism.Therefore, the confusion reflected from the contradictory statements of those who were supposed to remove this confusion and unite the nation. If we have not learnt any lesson from the massacre of our children in Army Public School, Peshawar, and still looking for ' if and buts,' we are adding towards a serious problem.Yes, the world has not done justice with us and US-led coalition is need to, 'do more,' but, at the same time we are our best judge as what we had done and where we need to, do more. This divided position within the country is 'dangerous,' as on the one hand there has been alarming rise in the extremist mindset in the absence of any counter narrative and as a result it has now reached in our campuses and in the society, and on the other hand our failure to remove our basic confusion.Pakistan for years has problems in dealing on four fronts. (1) Global terror networks like al-Qaeda and now Daesh, (2) Sectarian outfits, which have also taken roots within the country, (3) Ethnic and separatist groups, and (4) Kashmiri jihadi outfits.If we really want to make Pakistan a more tolerant society and win the real war against terrorism and extremism, there are areas where we need to, do more, not for US or any other country, but for Pakistan.The state needs to decide which narrative would ultimately prevail, State or non-state actors. Therefore, the civil and military leadership will have to sit, think and come out with counter-narrative and with one voice, failure is not the option in this war.The article was originally published in The News."
1220,"The world is getting ready to witness another theatre of a terminal war in Asia. The only difference this time is that it’s going to be the first millennial bombing on a non-Muslim and nuclear power.Some believe that if North Korea were a Muslim state, Kim Jong-un would have met the fate of Saddam or Qaddafi years ago. But the ground reality is somewhat different. Threatened by adversaries and increasingly isolated by long-term allies, the relatively young Jong-un is a wounded bear bent upon fighting to the end and in that destroying everything coming in the way. The stakes are so high that, theoretically, more lives are in danger than all those lost in all the recent wars combined.As war looms over it, nothing is more important for North Korea than its strategic location. The very lifeline of North Korea is its ally China, with which it shares a densely populated long border, almost equal to the distance between Karachi and Islamabad. Russia shares a relatively very small and sparsely populated land area with North Korea, almost equal to the distance between Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The maritime distance with Moscow is also insignificant but Putin is monitoring the situation very closely as his enemy is marching towards another frontier. Unlike Pakistan that has, unfortunately, estranged almost every neighbour, Pyongyang has thorny relations with only one bordering country – South Korea. Since the bloody divide in 1945, both dream unification to their advantage but are technically at war with each other.Jong-un might not have inherited wisdom from his late grandfather but he definitely has his warrior genes. The DPRK’s revolutionary founder, Kim II Sung, who fought a successful guerrilla war against the Japanese colonial forces in 1945, left a legacy of resistance. Upon his death, the country witnessed the beginning of a dynastic rule as his son Kim Jong-il became the successor and inherited – among other things – a nuclear programme. Il might not be remembered for his individuality but will always be credited for testing the first nuclear weapon as the six-party talks failed, thanks to the unrealistic preconditions of the Bush administration which insisted on complete dismantlement.No country other than South Africa has given up its nuclear weapons while others have only improved them. As Jong-il realised that the economic noose was being tightened around his country and the US was opting for a ‘my way or the highway’ attitude, he went ahead on the missile launch and even broke the commitment to halt nuclear developments. Young Jong-un assumed office after the collapse of those talks. He also knows the invasion tactics of the US, which offers a sugar-coated bait of security guarantees and improved diplomatic and economic relations for disarmament. The fall of Libya strengthened Jong-un’s conviction that only nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles could save his country.The most fortunate thing for Jong-un is his country’s geography. Pyongyang and Seoul are closer than the distance between Karachi and Hyderabad, with Seoul around 50 kilometres of the border. By deploying more than 13,000 artillery pieces along this border, North Korea has left no stone unturned to scare its next-door neighbour. Even if two-thirds of the artillery pieces hit the world’s ninth most densely-populated capital city, where almost half the country’s population lives, the DPRK has the power to turn Seoul into a living hell.Around 150,000 US citizens live in South Korea, and the country’s capital is home to 40,000 Americans and 15,000 Japanese nationals. American casualties in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars are still less than 7,000; so, imagine how damaging even a conventional war can be for the two allies. Militarily, there is no comparison between a country that has recently tested the mother of all bombs in Afghanistan and has sophisticated nuclear, biological and chemical weapons of every possible scale to the one and a country that has almost everything that is outdated. But, this makes not only South Korea but also Japan and the US even more vulnerable as the so-called hermit kingdom may not wait to try its recently upgraded nuclear arsenal as the last resort.Increasingly seen unavoidable, a war between the US and North Korea will be tragic on an unbelievable scale. Due to the South Korean involvement, we could see families and extended families fighting each other. Such a war also has the potential to destroy the most modern infrastructure that is in place in at least South Korea and Japan, costing trillions of dollars to both world economies and resulting in a possible domino effect for other nations.The Swiss-educated Kim Jong-un, shown on media with largely broad smile on his face, may be ruthless like those rulers who don’t even spare their own blood relatives for power. But those who are on the opposite side are hardly angels – and may even be worse. After months of blusters and sabre-rattling – followed by a most undiplomatic verbal attack by Trump in the United Nations – Jong-un knows being tamed into talks is really a bait. To him, the enemy is eyeing the more than 10 trillion dollars worth of two hundred types of minerals that North Korea has under its mountains not to mention gold and even rare earth metals used in our smartphones and other high-tech products.The way ahead is dark, although a ray of hope may emerge if the world’s most isolated leader is invited for talks by Putin or Jinping, who despite having maintained a distance in all this, still have some way to influence Kim Jong-un. Otherwise, history will remember Jong-un as a dictator who fought till death to defend his country; the millions of Koreans that could be annihilated in the war will just be commemorated as unsung heroes.The article was originally posted in The News."
1221,"QUETTA: Five people were killed and one injured as unidentified gunmen targetted a vehicle carrying members of the Hazara community on the city’s Kasi Road early Monday, police said.According to police officials, the deceased include the vehicle's driver and a passerby as well — both not Hazara.The victims were on their way to Sabzi Mandi from Mariabad when their vehicle was targeted by the assailants, who were riding a motorcycle.The gunmen escaped unhurt after carrying out the attack, which appears to be an act of targeted killing, police officials added.The bodies and injured were shifted to a nearby hospital. Later, four of the bodies were handed over to their families in Quetta, hospital officials said, adding that one of the deceased is still in the morgue as he hails from Shangla, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Hazara community members were identified as Mohammad Ali, Khadim Hussain and Syed Sarwar while the passerby was identified as Saleh Mohammad. Police and other law enforcement agencies personnel reached the site after the incident and started an investigation.Members of the persecuted Shia Hazara community are often targetted in Quetta."
1222,"Earlier this month, the Allama Iqbal Open University announced launching a free education programme for transgender persons, but a couple of years before that, Nisha Rao had set a course for herself to join the legal fraternity.Nisha’s journey to fulfil her dreams has been riddled with discrimination, humiliation and insensitivity, but she remained undeterred and rose above everything life threw at her. Now in the final year of her LLB programme, her goal of becoming a lawyer is within reach.Born as Kashif in Lahore, Nisha was enrolled at a private English-medium school. “Until the sixth class, I wasn’t aware of being different,” she recalls.“Initially, after my classmates made me realise it, I ignored it. But their attitude towards me turned agonising to put up with as the years passed. By the eighth class, I was being bullied and persecuted.”She still remembers the days when, as soon as she would enter the school, a few of the bullies would gather around her to crack jokes at her expense and everyone would join in the gales of laughter.“I was so frightened that I never dared complain about them to my teachers or my parents. Every passing day made me feel more alienated and secluded. Adding insult to injury was the attitude of my family towards me.”She recalls her elder brother’s wedding ceremony, in which her own cousins made fun of her voice and the way she talked and behaved, with none of the elders stepping in to put an end to their mockery.Instead, she says, the guests laughed at their lame jokes, which added to her worries regarding her gender and her future, as every incident seemed more tormenting than the last.She remembers another incident from 2004. “On the eve of Independence Day, I took a Pakistan flag to the school, where boys gathered around me and said, ‘Look at this! Now hijras will be waving our flag.’ ”It was the first time that she responded with anger, and she was severely beaten up by the boys for it, but no one came to her aid. After enrolling at a college two years later, she breathed a sigh of relief, as she found the environment there much better than at her school, and her college teachers were compassionate as well.Post intermediate, she came to terms with reality. “By then I was more expressive of my gender. I left my family and came to Karachi, where I stayed with my childhood friend, also a transgender person, Sona, for three months.”Nisha went back home expecting her family and neighbours to have missed her, but she was in for a bitter awakening. “On my return, all the children of the locality gathered to chant ‘Khusra aa gaya’.”She ignored them, but when she reached home, she found her own family unwelcoming. She felt like a stranger in her own house. She wanted to continue her education, but her ostracism was getting to her.Finally, after admitting to herself that her situation would remain unchanged where she was born and brought up, she decided to bid adieu to her family. She informed Sona about her decision, and the childhood friend promised to do everything she could to help her with her goal to continue her education.Nisha moved to Karachi in 2009, and got enrolled at the Karachi University’s Department of Political Science. She provided private tuition to support herself, but since it was not enough, she learned to dance to pay the house rent and university fees and to purchase books.“My circumstances kept me away from campus education, but I carried on without losing hope. I completed my masters in political science in 2013. The day I graduated was the happiest of my life.”She later joined the Gender Interactive Alliance (GIA), which works for the rights of the transgender community. She moved to Islamabad after she was appointed as treasurer, but due to financial constraints, she left the post and returned to Karachi.Despite failing to get a job and being faced with other hurdles, she did not lose hope. In 2015 she got enrolled at the Sindh Muslim Law College. “My course has entered its third and final year. Then I shall get my LLB degree. It’s my dream to become a judge. It might seem an implausible goal, but I shall continue striving to accomplish it.”A lot of things have changed in Nisha’s life over the past few years, but the most prominent among them is her relatives who have started treating her with respect. She hopes that the people who used to humiliate her may find themselves reconsidering their actions now.GIA President Bindiya Rana is highly appreciative of Nisha’s struggles and hard work, and calls her a role model for others. She, however, reminds how members of our society still look the other way when it comes to issues of transgender persons. “Transgender people are symbols of shame and disgrace for their own parents and families. Proper education opportunities, understanding of gender differences and a little empathy would mean a lot.”Bindiya says that in the current scenario, the overall attitude towards the community needs to be changed so transgender children do not feel marginalised and alienated. “Special measures should be taken for their education in public or private institutions because their most critical issue is illiteracy.” Except for some NGOs, she says, there is no public organisation for educating transgender persons. “Literacy is the key. If they get an education, they would be able to establish themselves like other people in society.”Hamid Karim, who heads the Directorate of Elementary, Secondary & Higher Secondary Schools in Karachi, says that at school level transgender children have no identity and may face discriminatory behaviour once in a blue moon. “But there is no restriction on their enrolment because education is the fundamental right of everyone. Government schools, however, have no special arrangements for them, but they can get an education there without fear.”Muhammad Mashooque, who heads the Directorate of College Education in Karachi, says they encourage transgender children to get higher education. “At college level fellow students may use opprobrious remarks for them because our society is ignorant of transgender issues. Students reflect society’s mindset, which must be changed.”The article was originally published in The News."

At many places, people caught hold of the braid choppers; however, they were rescued by Indian police and soldiers.On Sunday, clashes erupted after youth took to the streets against the highhandedness of Indian police in Islamabad town. The youth raised anti-India and pro-freedom slogans and marched on the streets of Reshibazar. Meanwhile, traders of Islamabad district continued their protest for the second consecutive day on Sunday against the brutalities of the Indian police.

1229,"The United States and Turkey on Sunday scaled back visa issuing services in each other´s countries in a deepening diplomatic row sparked by the arrest of a Turkish staffer at the American mission in Istanbul.The American embassy in Ankara said that ""recent events"" forced the US government to reassess Turkey´s ""commitment"" to the security of US mission services and personnel in the country.In order to minimise the number of visitors while the assessment is carried out, ""effective immediately we have suspended all non-immigrant visa services at all US diplomatic facilities in Turkey,"" it said.'Recent events have forced the US to reassess Turkey's commitment to security of US mission, personnel,'Non-immigrant visas are issued to all those travelling to the United States for tourism, medical treatment, business, temporary work or study. Immigrant visa services are only for those seeking to live in the US permanently.Turkey responded by suspending ""all visa services"" for Americans in the US, saying the measures also apply to visas issued online and at the border.In an apparent attempt to mock the US announcement, the Turkish embassy in Washington issued two statements that were almost word-for-word copies of that from the American embassy in Ankara.The statements said concerns over US commitment to the security of Turkish diplomatic facilities and personnel necessitated the restrictions, but the fact that they only apply to Americans and also include visas issued at the border and online indicate the move is punitive rather than security-based.The first statement from the Turkish embassy said the restrictions apply to ""visas in passports"" while the second replaced that wording with ""sticker visas"". It was unclear if that meant that visas already stamped in passports would not be accepted.Beyond its mention of ""recent events"", the American embassy statement made no explicit mention of the arrest by Turkish authorities of a local Turkish staffer working at the US consulate in Istanbul.The employee was remanded in custody by an Istanbul court late Wednesday on accusations of links to the group of US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Ankara for last year´s failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The staffer has been formally charged with espionage and seeking to overthrow the Turkish government.The US embassy on Thursday said it was ""deeply disturbed"" over the arrest and rejected the allegations against the employee as ""wholly without merit"".It also condemned leaks in the local press which it said came from Turkish government sources that were ""seemingly aimed at trying the employee in the media rather than a court of law"".But Erdogan´s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin has defended the arrest, saying ""there must be serious evidence"" and pointing to a phone call made from the Istanbul consulate to a key suspect on the night of the coup.For Soner Cagaptay, Director of the Turkish Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in Washington DC, the situation signifies the unfolding of an historic crisis in US-Turkey relations.""The idea is that this step would convince the Turkish elites to persuade Erdogan to stop harassing US citizens in Turkey -- I think Erdogan will do the opposite and escalate,"" he told AFP. The pro-government Yeni Safak daily described it as ""a scandalous decision from the United States"".Turkish officials had expressed hope of a new page in Ankara-Washington relations under President Donald Trump.Turkey has pressed Washington for the extradition of Pennsylvania-based Gulen, who denies any link to the coup bid -- but the lack of movement on the issue has further strained ties.Meanwhile, members of Erdogan´s security detail were indicted by US authorities after clashes with protesters during an official visit this year, infuriating the Turkish president.American pastor Andrew Brunson, who ran a church in the western city of Izmir, has been held by Turkish authorities since October 2016 on charges of being a member of Gulen´s group.Erdogan suggested last month that Turkey could release him in exchange for Gulen but Washington showed little interest in the proposal."
1230,"LOS ANGELES: “Blade Runner 2049” is heading for a downbeat $31.5 million opening weekend at 4,058 sites in North America.Sunday’s estimated result throws serious doubt onto what had been high hopes for a box office success story. In one of the most surprising turnarounds in recent years, “Blade Runner 2049” fell far short of expectations, which had been in the $45 million to $50 million range at the start of the weekend amid stellar reviews, strong advance ticket sales, and the revered status of 1982’s original “Blade Runner.”Instead, the film grossed only a moderate $12.7 million on Friday, including $4 million from Thursday night previews. Saturday saw an 11 per cent decline to $11.4 million and Sunday’s projected total was $7.4 million.The key factors for the under-performance were the movie’s 163-minute running time — which limits the number of showings each day — plus far less traction among younger moviegoers than anticipated.“The core of enthusiastic and loyal ‘Blade Runner’ fans were over 25 and predominantly male and propelled the film as expected to the top spot, but a lengthy running time and lesser interest among females made it tougher for the film to reach the original weekend box office projections,” said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst with comScore.According to PostTrack, males over 25 represented 50 per cent of the audience and females over 25 were 27 per cent, while males under 25 represented 15 per cent of moviegoers and females under 25 were 8 per cent. Males gave the movie an A CinemaScore, while females gave it a B+.Warner Bros is handling domestic distribution on “Blade Runner 2049,” starring Ryan Gosling and Harrison Ford, through its output deal with Alcon Entertainment. Financed by Alcon and Sony and laden with special effects, the film carries a $150 million price tag. Denis Villeneuve helms the sequel film, which is set in a bleak 2049 Los Angeles with Gosling starring as an LAPD officer dealing with replicants seeking freedom.Warner Bros domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein said “Blade Runner 2049” had fallen short of expectations in mid-sized and smaller markets along with the South and Midwest, where the running time and Major League Baseball playoffs appeared to have held down attendance.“We did well in the major and high-profile markets,” he added. “Alcon and Denis made an amazing movie. The audience for it was narrower than we anticipated.”Fox’s opening of survival drama “The Mountain Between Us,” starring Idris Elba and Kate Winslet, was the weekend’s runner-up, coming in slightly below projections with a moderate $10.1 million at 3,088 venues. Based on the Charles Martin novel, the film stars Elba as a surgeon and Winslet as a journalist who are left stranded together following a plane crash. Reviews have been mixed, earning the film a 46 per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes.Lionsgate’s animated “My Little Pony” trotted in with a modest $8.8 million at 2,528 locations, slightly above forecasts. Based on the Hasbro toys and TV series, the movie’s voice cast includes Emily Blunt, Kristin Chenoweth, Uzo Aduba, and Sia.The fifth weekend of New Line’s blockbuster “It” showed plenty of staying power in third place with $9.6 million at 3,197 sites. It will close the weekend with $305 million domestically plus $298.8 million internationally to top the $600 million worldwide mark.Fox’s third weekend of “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” and Universal’s second weekend of “American Made” were battling for fifth place with about $8.1 million each, followed by Warner’s third weekend of “The Lego Ninjago Movie” with $6.8 million. Focus Features’ expansion of Judi Dench’s “Victoria & Abdul” came in eighth with $4.1 million at 732 locations."

1234,"DHAKA: Left-arm spinner Zafar Ansari dismissed Mahmudullah Riyad off the final ball of the day to bring England back into the contest in the second Test after Bangladesh surged ahead with 152-3 at stumps on the second day.Bangladesh made a confident start in the second innings thanks to a fluent batting by their top-order after Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid shared 99 runs in the ninth wicket to give England a vital 24-run first innings lead.The hosts wiped out the deficit quickly and went for almost five runs in an over in the final session to put the pressure back on England before Ansari´s late strike restored some parity for the visitors.Ansari earlier removed Tamim Iqbal for 40 to make the first innings century maker his maiden Test wicket and two balls later Ben Stokes got rid of Mominul Haque to put a brake on Bangladesh´s breakneck speed.But Imrul Kayes, unbeaten on 59, and Mahmudullah shared 86 runs for the third wicket to help the home side claw back their advantage.They were leading England by 128 runs at the end of the second day´s play with seven wickets in hand, which must have given them hopes for setting a decent target for England to chase in the fourth innings.""I think a lead of 300 would be good enough,"" said Bangladesh off-spinner Mehedi Hasan, who starred with 6-82 in England´s innings.""You cannot determine anything at the moment because there is still a lot of cricket left in the remaining three days,"" he said.Bangladesh dominated the opening session of the day to claim five wickets putting England on the ropes before Woakes and Rashid staged a fightback.Woakes made 46 while Rashid added an unbeaten 44 to lift England 244 from a precarious 144-8 giving them a handy 24-run lead in the first innings.""I think the partnership was crucial between us,"" Woakes said after the second day´s play.""The slim lead surely added some advantage. The game would have different if we were 80 runs behind.""Their die-hard batting overshadowed the bowling heroics of Bangladesh´s teenage spin sensation Mehedi, who completed his second five-wicket haul in as many matches.Mehedi broke the partnership with the second new ball when he forced an edge from Woakes at slip and five balls later left-arm spinner Taijul Islam, who claimed 3-65, wrapped up England´s innings.England could have been dismissed a little earlier if Woakes was not given a reprieve when Sabbir Rahman had him caught by Mahmudullah for 38 with a full toss delivery.Replay confirmed the ball was above the waist prompting the umpires to call Woakes back.Resuming on 50-3, England found themselves in deep trouble in the morning session before Joe Root offered some resistance with 56 off 122 balls.Jonny Bairstow, who made 24, gave him some support in their 45-run sixth wicket stand.Mehedi, who claimed seven wickets in Bangladesh´s 22-run loss in the first Test, including 6-80 in a single innings, again drew first blood, bowling overnight batsman Moeen Ali for 10 in the third over.Taijul removed Stokes, the man of the match in the first Test, for a duck two overs later before Root and Bairstow repaired England innings.Mehedi returned for his second spell to hit Bairstow plumb in front in his first ball, ending their resistance.Taijul removed Root almost identically to expose England´s tail after Mehedi complete his five-wicket haul with the wicket of Ansari. "

1247,"Former president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, has said that Daesh has emerged in Afghanistan in the past three to four years under the watch of US military and intelligence agencies.In an interview with Russia Today in London, published on October 4, Karzai said he has more than suspicions that US bases in Afghanistan are used to aid Daesh. “I get daily reports by the Afghan people that unmarked military helicopters supply Daesh in many parts of Afghanistan,” he claimed.Karzai said that from 9/11 until today, there is more extremism in Afghanistan, despite spending billions of dollars. He stated that the Afghan people ask that if the US came to Afghanistan to defeat extremism, ""why do we have more of it today"".The US Department of Defense posted a video of the strike on Twitter with the caption: “We don’t want our country to be bombed with huge, destructive weapons. We want peace,” said Karzai, adding that the use of MOAB (mother of all bombs) by the US forces was an indication to North Korea to show off US power, but it was an atrocity on the Afghan people.On April 13 this year the US dropped one of its largest non-nuclear bombs on a tunnel complex reportedly used by Daesh in eastern Afghanistan. It was the first time such a weapon had been used in battle.“Military action, especially by foreign forces, will not bring peace. Afghans need to evolve a consensus to reach out to everybody, including ‘sons of the soil’ Taliban, to seek a settlement,” he suggested.The former president said the US needs to become a cooperative partner in the region, including with China, Russia, Pakistan and India, to bring peace.With regards to Pakistan, Karzai said we have to live together with Pakistan. He said there are two strong contrasts in their relationship with Pakistan: “Pakistani people welcomed us when we became refugees. But they also did the horrible activity of supporting the Mujahideen [against Soviets] which weakened our society.”Both sides agreed to evolve bilateral process for minimising misunderstanding, managing crises and enhancing cooperation: ISPR Karzai said he hopes the new US policy for the region sees that Pakistan was used by the US against its neighbour for an inhumane purpose. He said they want to join hands with Pakistan to “salvage us from this deep conspiracy”.When asked about Iran’s role in Afghanistan, Karzai said Iran is not at all the problem but in fact has been a tremendous help. “It is a country that is clearly against extremism,” said Karzai, adding that present Afghan President Ashraf Ghani should ensure that Afghanistan’s soil is not used against Iran, or any other neighbouring country for that matter. "

We respect the rule of law and the constitution,” she said, adding that when one’s intentions are clear, he or she isn’t afraid of going anywhere.When asked whether Hasan and Hussain Nawaz will also appear before the NAB court, Maryam said the decision was for them to make.Commenting on Nawaz’s recent re-election as the head of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Maryam said, “It is surprising that those who have nothing to do with the PML-N are raising objections about Nawaz Sharif becoming the party president. No one should have any issue with him being in that position. God has given him a respectable position that politics revolve around him, whether he was in government as prime minister or now out of government. The PML-N has a democratic right to elect as its president whoever it wants.She added: “God willing, the 2018 elections will be held on time and a democratic government will complete its tenure and pass on the baton to the next.”Speaking to Geo News, Captain (retd) Safdar said they have held legal consultations with their lawyers and everything is finalised in this regard. “We will face courts and not run away,” said the National Assembly member from Mansehra. Maryam and Safdar face a corruption reference related to the Sharif family’s Avenfield properties in London.

1261,"BEIRUT/DUBAI: Iran warned the United States against designating its Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist group and said US regional military bases would be at risk if further sanctions were passed.The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new US responses to Iran’s missile tests, support for “terrorism” and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy.“As we’ve announced in the past, if America’s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000 km range of Iran’s missiles,” Guards’ commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media.Jafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops.“If the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Daesh all around the world particularly in the Middle East,” Jafari said.The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran’s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC’s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organizations, but the organization as a whole is not.On June 7, Daesh claimed an attack on Tehran’s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at Daesh bases in Syria on June 18 in response.Guards commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against Daesh.Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.The website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues.Jafari also said that Tehran would ramp up its defence capabilities, including its missile program if the US undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers.Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions.However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.“The Americans should know that the Trump government’s stupid behaviour with the nuclear deal will be used by Daesh as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defence program,” Jafari said, according to state media.The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the US allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea.If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the US Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. UN inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms.The Guards navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the US Navy in recent months.More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying."

When he is full of himself, I must feel ‘I am the best.’ It should come from within, which doesn’t normally come to me. I am always questioning my work.""He further said, “My natural instinct is to be critical of myself whereas this guy is not at all. He is sure that he is the best, no question about it.”  “You may see glimpses of people but it’s not modelled on any one person. It’s not inspired by anyone.” "

Another woman was attacked with a sharp object in Karachi’s Pehlwan Goth vicinity late ThursdayThe police have numerous theories including copycat attacks and an organised group operating from within the city.Karachi Police released pictures — screengrabs from the CCTV footage — of the suspect Saturday night, wherein the assailant can be seen riding a motorbike moments before attacking one of the victims.""The suspect appears to be a thin man, aged 20-29,"" DIG East Sultan Khawaja said, adding that ""he appears to be 5 feet, 7-9 inches tall"" and usually rides a red motorcycle.The case — which has left citizens questioning their safety — has been handed over to the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) that has deployed a case team to work on ways to capture the suspect, sources say.Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Friday claimed that the suspect had been identified and was believed to be the same person who was behind similar attacks in Punjab’s Chichawatni area, where 50 women were injured in knife attacks over three years since 2013."
1264,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif unveiled a mega-transport scheme, Orange Line Metro Project, in Punjab’s capital on Sunday.While addressing the event, he remarked that people levelling false allegations are wasting the time of nation.When metro bus project was under construction, our opponents called it 'jangla bus' and claimed that money has been embezzled. Interestingly, our opponents then announced metro bus project in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ""However, there is no sign of metro bus in Peshawar,"" he claimed.""It was alleged that corruption worth Rs70 billion occurred in metro bus project. However, our opponents could not even prove Rs35 billion corruption,"" remarked Shehbaz.""If the corruption is proven then the nation can hold me accountable."" Lashing out at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, he said that the party has done nothing for the people in KP.People who speak about 'tabdeeli' [change], are the ones who did nothing to provide any relief to the people. There is no metro bus or any development happening, he claimed, adding that when dengue outbreak hit Peshawar, PTI Cheif Imran Khan chose to hide in the mountains.Speaking about the benefits of the project, he said it will make conveyance easy for everyone. ""This is the best inter-city transport project,"" he added.  Before the event, he sent messages on social media lauding the project.Sharif also said that the project is meant to make the underprivileged feel that “they have equal rights on the state resources as their rich counterparts… it aims to create equality.”The management has finalised the arrangements for the event. The 27 trains are likely to cover the distance as per the route built up until December 25 — when the project is set to be launched. A single train has the capacity to carry 1,000 people, out of which 200 can be seated while 800 can commute while standing.The project has also been included in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, it was decided in the Economic Coordination Committee meeting held in January.“All train projects in other provinces will also become part of the CPEC,” the statement added.The metro train is expected to run on electricity and to transport up to 250,000 passengers a day. The capacity will be increased to 500,000 passengers by 2025.Launched in May 2014 by the Punjab chief minister, in collaboration with a Chinese company, the project will be the country’s first metro line. The construction for the project began in 2015 and was personally supervised by Sharif. Costing a whopping $1.6 billion, the 27-kilometres rail line was set to be up and running by mid-2017 but got embroiled in a legal battle in the Lahore High Court which ordered a stay on several sites as the development was trampling over heritage sites in Lahore. "
1265,"LONDON: British police said they had arrested a woman who was trying to scale the front gates of Queen Elizabeth’s Buckingham Palace home in central London on Saturday, saying the incident was not terrorism-related.“The woman, believed to be in her 30s, was quickly detained by officers before she gained access to the palace grounds,” police said. She was arrested on suspicion of trespass and is being questioned at a central London police station.“The incident is not being treated as terrorist-related,” police said.British police are on high alert after five attacks blamed on terrorism this year.In August, a man wielding a sword outside the palace was charged under terrorism laws. Three police officers suffered minor injuries detaining him.There have been a number of other incidents in recent years in which people have tried to get into the palace grounds.Last October, a 21-year-old man was arrested after scaling a gate of the palace. He was later detained under a hospital order.In May 2016, a man with a conviction for murder climbed over the wall and walked for about 10 minutes around the grounds of the palace before being arrested. He was jailed for four months.Four years ago, a man armed with a knife tried to enter through a gate and was later jailed for 16 months. A month earlier, two men were arrested following a break-in at the palace.One of the biggest security breaches at Buckingham Palace happened in 1982 when Michael Fagan — an intruder — climbed a wall and wandered into a room where the queen was in bed."

1267,"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday announced pro-Ankara Syrian rebels were launching a new military operation in Syria's northwestern Idlib province to push out the militants who control the region.The move comes as Turkey, along with Russia and Iran, prepare to set up a so-called ""de-escalation"" zone in Idlib in line with accords in peace talks in Astana aimed at ending the Syrian civil war.Turkish commando units and military vehicles have reportedly massed on the border but are yet to cross, in what will be Ankara's second major Syria operation after its Euphrates Shield incursion last year.""We are taking new steps to ensure security in Idlib. Today, a very serious operation is ongoing in Idlib and this will continue,"" Erdogan said in a televised speech in the western city of Afyon.He later told reporters the operation was led by Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels and that the Turkish army was ""not yet"" operating inside Syria.Aron Lund, fellow with The Century Foundation think tank, told AFP any Turkish operation ""is likely to rely on a mix of Turkish and Syrian forces"".He said Turkey would contribute special forces, logistics, artillery and tanks but Syria rebels would make up ""much of"" the ground force.Idlib is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate, which ousted more moderate rebels in recent months.HTS is not party to a deal brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran for the safe zone in the province, one of four such ""de-escalation"" zones across Syria.""If Turkey decides to go head to head with HTS, I'm sure they will meet severe resistance,"" Lund told AFP.Ousting HTS forces from the area will be needed to allow the arrival of Iranian, Russian and Turkish forces to implement a de-escalation zone.""We will absolutely not allow the creation of a terror corridor along our borders,"" said Erdogan.State-run Anadolu news agency said there was a major buildup of commando units and military vehicles around the town of Reyhanli bordering Idlib close to the Cilvegozu border crossing.The Hurriyet daily said ultimately Turkey would ensure security in Idlib city and Russia in the surrounding area.Appearing to confirm this, Erdogan said: ""Idlib is a region where we will provide protection on the inside and Russia on the outside.""Turkish army cranes had begun removing sections of the security wall Turkey has built on the border in apparent preparation for an incursion, an AFP photographer said.Turkey earlier this year wrapped up its half-year Euphrates Shield operation against militants and Kurdish militia in Aleppo province that involved both the Turkish army and Syrian rebels.""Despite all the provocations and the obstacles, we have made significant progress in Syria,"" said Erdogan.A rebel commander participating in the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP in Beirut that ""all the rebel groups"" who took part in Euphrates Shield are participating.""The goal of the operation is to liberate Idlib fully from Tahrir al-Sham,"" he said.Turkey has also long warned it could also move against Kurdish militia in Afrin to the east. Erdogan warned that ""new initiatives"" would follow after the Idlib operation.But Ankara is playing no part in the US-backed assault to prise the Syrian city of Raqa from the Islamic State group due to the involvement of Kurdish militia Turkey considers a terror outfit.The Idlib operation comes a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Erdogan in Ankara, with both sides agreeing to push for the Idlib de-escalation zone.Afer those talks Putin declared the right conditions now existed to end the over six-year civil war that has killed an estimated 330,000 people since 2011.Despite being on opposite sides of the conflict, Russia and Turkey have been working together intensely since a 2016 reconciliation deal ended a crisis caused by the shooting down of a Russian war plane over Syria.Russia, along with Iran, is the key backer of President Bashar al-Assad and Moscow´s military intervention inside Syria is widely seen as tipping the balance in the conflict. Turkey, however, has backed rebels seeking Assad´s ouster.Commenting on the coordination with Russia, Erdogan said: ""Relations with the regime is something looked after by Russia, and we have taken measures in other areas."""
1268,"DUBAI: Sri Lankan opener Dimuth Karunaratne hit a career-best 196 which left Pakistan fighting to avoid defeat in the second day-night Test in Dubai on Saturday.Karunaratne missed a double hundred by four runs but lifted Sri Lanka to an imposing 482 in their first innings before Pakistan finished the second day at 51-0, still trailing by 431 runs.Openers Sami Aslam (30 not out) and Shan Masood (15 not out) negotiated the 18 overs under light without any major trouble but Pakistan still needs 231 to avoid the follow-on.That leaves Pakistan in a spot of bother to square the series after losing the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi and, more importantly, save their seven-year unbeaten series record in the United Arab Emirates.It was another brilliant display by the Sri Lankan batsmen led by left-hander Karunaratne.Karunaratne deserved a double hundred during a marathon nine-hour stay at the crease but he was unluckily dismissed, playing onto leg-spinner Yasir Shah just before dinner.Karunaratne hit 19 boundaries and a six, improving on his previous best Test score of 186 made against the West Indies at Galle two years ago.When on 143 he brought up his 3,000th run in his 44th Test, the 12th Sri Lankan to reach that milestone.Shah took 6-184 in a marathon 55.5 overs of hard work and toil on a flat Dubai stadium pitch. His haul makes him the only spinner ever to take five or more wickets in five consecutive Tests.England's Sydney Barnes holds the record for most consecutive five-wicket hauls with seven in as many Tests. Australia's Charlie Turner and Englishman Alec Bedser had six consecutive five-fours - but all three were fast bowlers.Karunaratne added 146 with skipper Dinesh Chandimal (62) for the fourth wicket before another 88 were put on for the fifth between him and Niroshan Dickwella, who made a rapid 52.As if that was not enough, Karunaratne put on 59 for the sixth wicket with Dilruwan Perera, who scored a polished 58.Resuming at 254-3, Sri Lanka lost Chandimal to a leg before decision off Shah. Chandimal knocked six boundaries in another enterprising knock which followed his unbeaten 155 in the first Test.Dickwella's assured knock had five boundaries before he edged pacer Mohammad Abbas to wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed while Perera smashed seven boundaries before becoming Shah´s fifth wicket -- his 13th five wicket haul in 28 Tests.Abbas then had Suranga Lakmal for eight to finish with 2-100 while Shah ended the innings by dismissing Nuwan Pradeep for nought.Pakistan´s miseries were compounded in the morning when pace spearhead Mohammad Amir walked off the field after a recurring shin injury sustained late on Friday. He managed to bowl just three overs in the day.Pakistan trail by 1-0 in the series after they lost the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi.Pakistan, who have never lost a Test series in the United Arab Emirates, also wasted both their reviews off the second new ball to cap a woeful day for them yesterday.Chandimal's team will look to become the first to win a Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, whereas for Pakistan, it is a must-win encounter to save the series."

He struggled with the same issue on day one of the Test as well.A statement from PCB says that the fast bowler underwent MRI scans after complaints of pain in his shin and following the scans he has been advised a rest of two to three weeks.“The fast bowler has been advised two to three weeks rest after he underwent MRI scans today following complaints of pain in his right shin,” said the statement from PCB.“Amir will not bowl in the on-going Test match at the Dubai Cricket Stadium, but would available to bat,” the statement added.His replacement in ODI squad will be announced in due course.Mohammad Aamir, since he returned to international cricket in January 2016, has bowled 821.3 overs collectively across all three formats in international cricket, third-most by a fast bowler after Kagiso Rabada (896.3) and Josh Hazlewood (846.1)."

The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites.Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to “support licensed mobile carriers’ restoration of limited communications capability” in Puerto Rico.Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.“It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services,” Pai said in a statement.Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a “great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow.”Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc, said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago.Musk said he was diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and “increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.”In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria."
1277,"HOUSTON: Hurricane Nate had curtailed 92 percent of US Gulf of Mexico oil output and up to 3 percent of refining capacity as of Saturday afternoon as it sped toward energy facilities in the central US Gulf Coast that largely were spared by Hurricane Harvey’s wrath nearly six weeks ago.The fast-moving storm has forced evacuations at more than 300 US Gulf of Mexico offshore platforms, far more than the number affected by Harvey, which packed more of a punch when it hit the Texas coast.Nate could become a Category 2 storm, the second-weakest on a five-category scale used by meteorologists, with winds of up to 177 kilometres per hour (110 miles per hour) before landfall later on Saturday, the National Hurricane Center said.Its track takes it closer to offshore production unlike Harvey, whose impact was greatest on refining centres.On Saturday, some 1.6 million barrels per day of oil and 2.48 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output were halted by the storm, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reported.Colby Goatley — a meteorologist at Weather Decision Technologies Inc — said his firm is helping about 10 drilling rig operators chart a course away from Nate, which is producing waves of up to 30 feet (9.1 m) near its centre.“Rigs on the eastern side (of Nate) are racing westward to get on that more favourable side,” he said.Weather Decision is expecting tropical storm-force winds to last about 12 hours, Goatley said, a relatively short period that will help offshore producers return to full operations quickly and rigs return to their drilling sites.Nate is converging on refineries that remained in operation during Harvey, with Phillips 66’s Alliance plant, Valero Energy Corp’s Meraux facility, and PBF Energy’s Chalmette plant — all in Louisiana — and Chevron Corp’s plant in Pascagoula, Mississippi, all within the impact zone.Chevron halted production at the Pascagoula plant on Saturday, according to energy information service Genscape.A Chevron representative was unavailable for immediate comment. Phillips 66 confirmed that it shut its Alliance refinery on Saturday.Combined, the two process 587,000 barrels per day, or 3 percent, of the nation’s refining capacity. Hurricane Harvey, which brought intense rains that flooded the Texas Gulf Coast, shut nearly a quarter of US oil refining capacity.Valero and PBF Energy were planning to keep running during Nate’s passage, according to sources familiar with those operations.Chevron earlier had made preliminary preparations for the storm, including securing loose equipment, and positioning standby generators, according to sources."
1278,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Saturday said “only one thing will work” in dealing with North Korea after previous administrations had talked to Pyongyang without results.“Presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid,” Trump said in a tweet.“...hasn’t worked, agreements violated before the ink was dry, making fools of US negotiators. Sorry, but only one thing will work!”Trump did not make clear to what he was referring, but his comments seemed to be a further suggestion that military action was on his mind.The president has previously said the United States would “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from Pyongyang’s nuclear threats.Earlier this week, during a meeting with top US military leaders and their spouses, Trump told reporters it was the “calm before the storm”. Asked for clarification then on what he meant, Trump said, “You’ll find out.”White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders referred to Iran and North Korea the following day when asked about Trump’s comments.Asked on Saturday about Trump’s tweet, the Pentagon said the Defense Department’s job was to “present the president military options and carry out orders”.Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea.On Sunday, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s government."

I didn´t feel safe driving at night, it was scary,"" Hanoi resident Nguyen Vu Ngoc, who was travelling in the north on Wednesday, told AFP.The disaster has killed 37 people in six provinces, with more than 18,800 houses damaged or destroyed along with tens of thousands of hectares of farmland, Vietnam Disaster Management Authority said. Officials said they were focused on rescuing dozens of missing people Thursday as rain subsided in most areas.Residents desperately ferried furniture and other belongings over flooded roads in Son La province, where houses were demolished and electricity poles torn down. At least 400 millimetres (16 inches) of rain have swamped northern and central Vietnam since Sunday, the disaster agency said.Vietnam is routinely hit with severe weather, with nearly 170 people killed or missing in disasters so far this year. A massive typhoon slammed into the central coast last month, killing 11 people and devastating entire towns. The country is routinely slammed by tropical storms in the May to October period. Last year, nearly 250 were killed or reported missing in weather-related disasters. Forecasters said a tropical depression east of the Philippines is expected to enter the South China Sea and strengthen in the next few days as it heads toward Vietnam. "
1308,"Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau said Wednesday it had detained a deputy defence minister and another top military official for allegedly embezzling millions in state funding through an illegal oil-purchase scheme.The announcement was the highest-profile indictment against any official since the Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) launched a graft case against the now-deposed tax service chief Roman Nasirov in March.NABU did not identify the two defence officials but said the fraud had cost the budget 149 million hryvnias ($5.6 million / 4.7 million euros at today's exchange rate) in 2016.The bureau said the arrangement involved an oil purchase contract that was later revised to inflate the original price by 16 percent to benefit the unnamed supplier.""NABU detectives and special anti-corruption prosecutors have detained two suspected culprits -- a deputy defence minister of Ukraine and the director of the state resource procurement and supply department of the Ukrainian defence ministry,"" NABU said in a statement.Ukraine's defence ministry said an investigation into two officials whose titles matched those named by NABU was in progress but provided no other details.Corruption has long ravaged the crisis-torn former Soviet republic and been a top concern of both Ukraine's foreign partners and global financial support organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).But NABU has faced stiff resistance since its launch in December 2015 from institutions such as the general prosecutor's office and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).Analysts view both as controlled by vested interests and incapable of leading independent probes into financial misdeeds.The IMF is pressing the pro-Western leaders who rose to power after a 2014 revolution ousted a Russian-backed regime to shore up NABU's efforts by setting up a special anti-corruption court.They say those indicted by NABU often walk free after paying bail and point to Nasirov's case as an example.Nasirov is still under investigation by the general prosecutor's office and has only been barred from leaving Kiev while he cooperates with the authorities in the slow-moving case.Poroshenko told a meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in the French city of Strasbourg on Wednesday that Ukraine had reached ""the point of no return for judicial reform"".""I know that the creation of the Anti-Corruption Court draws special attention,"" Poroshenko said in comments released by his office.""Currently, we are looking for optimal way to establish this vital body.""Poroshenko said the current draft law on anti-corruption courts had problems and required broader concensus.""That is why there is a need for all democratic political forces and civil society to get united,"" Poroshenko said."
1309,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s ferocious war on drugs will shift to a higher gear to target “big fish”, officials said on Thursday, moving away from street level operations to go after big networks and suppliers.Duterte issued a directive on Tuesday ordering the police to halt activities in the anti-drug campaign and leave all operations to the drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct.The national police chief disbanded all 18 regional anti-drugs units on Thursday and said the resources would be channeled into fighting other crimes.“We now target higher echelons of the syndicates, as well as their protectors in government,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella told reporters.Abella said the street level distribution networks of the “drug lords” had been degraded due to successful police operations in the 15-month old campaign.The message will sound familiar, with similar announcements made a year ago, when the authorities launched Project Double Barrel Alpha to focus on tracking down drug producers and suppliers.Critics say that never happened and the crackdown has been fixed on peddlers and users in urban poor neighborhoods, which have borne the brunt of the 3,900 killings by police during anti-drugs operations.Police say armed suspects resisted arrest in every one of those cases and deny allegations victims were executed. Police say some 2,300 killings by unknown gunmen have also occurred, likely drug-related.Duterte has lashed out several times when responding to comments from experts, calling some “idiots” for contradicting his views, or for advocating strategies to target the source of the drugs, rather than consumers.The change in tack comes at a difficult time for Duterte, who though still hugely popular, saw a sharp decline in ratings according to an opinion poll released on Sunday.It also followed an anti-Duterte protest last month by thousands of people in Manila, and a series of surveys that point to doubts among many Filipinos about the validity of police accounts, and whether those killed were all drug dealers.Duterte’s move follows the high-profile August killing of a 17-year-old student by police, which triggered rare public outrage.The new order that sidelines the police and leaves the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) the sole agency for the drugs war could impact the intensity of the crackdown.It has only a fraction of the manpower and budget of the police. Duterte placed PDEA in charge back in January and suspended police from all anti-drugs operations, but reinstated them a few week later, arguing that drugs had returned to the streets.PDEA spokesman Derreck Carreon said the agency had about 2,000 personnel and funds for only 200 new agents next year.Its proposed budget allocation for 2018 is 2.6 billion pesos ($50.63 million) compared to 131.2 billion the police, which has 175,000 men.Nonetheless, PDEA was up to the task.“We are ready, we can do it,” Carreon said.“We will target the source, the so-called big fish. Removing these high-value targets will also eliminate the street level distribution and disrupt the entire network.”Carreon said he could not guarantee there would be less bloodshed.“We follow the procedures, we don’t want an encounter but we also have to protect ourselves if drug suspects resist and fight back,” he said.The death toll has been a source of international concern that the Philippines has not taken kindly to, with its diplomats echoing Duterte’s defiant rhetoric and complaining of Western hypocrisy.A group of lawyers on Wednesday filed an injunction with the Supreme Court to try to stop the war on drugs, calling it as an illegal campaign that lets police kill and circumvent legal procedures.Some senators on Thursday said they would still scrutinize the crackdown, regardless of who leads it.“Changing of the guard is not enough,” said Senator Risa Hontiveros. “Duterte must stop and scrap the ‘Oplan Tokhang’ anti-drug campaign.”"
1310,"KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday acquitted a man 14 years after he was wrongfully convicted of murder in Karachi's Korangi area.Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, heading the three-member bench hearing the case, observed that the prosecution failed to prove their case.Shaukat was accused of murdering a man named Sagheer in 2003, for which he was sentenced to life by a trial court.The Sindh High Court also upheld the sentence after Shaukat filed an appeal.On February 2, the Lahore High Court gave release orders for a man accused of murder three years after his death in a jail.Syed Rasool was accused of killing a man named Baati in 2009.The court, citing incomplete evidence and questionable method of investigation, ordered a letter of acquittal to be sent to his house.The court had asked to provide a lawyer for Syed Rasool after he expressed his inability to pay for one due to poverty.Rasool’s family members informed the high court that he had died of a heart attack in 2014 during his detention."
1311,"HONG KONG/BEIJING : China said on Thursday it had the right to bar people from Hong Kong, a day after a British activist was denied entry into the former British colony, and that it had complained to Britain after it demanded an explanation.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” principle that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.But critics have accused the government of bending to the will of Communist Party leaders in Beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory’s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was “very concerned” that Benedict Rogers, a co-founder of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, was denied entry to Hong Kong on Wednesday and demanded an “urgent explanation” from Hong Kong and China.It came a week before a sensitive Communist Party leadership meeting starts in Beijing.Johnson also said Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were “central to its way of life”.Rogers has been a vocal critic of China-ruled Hong Kong’s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader Joshua Wong. He believes the decision to bar him was made by Chinese officials after the Chinese Embassy in London had warned him earlier, through a British member of parliament, that he wouldn’t be allowed in.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to Hong Kong.“The central Chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,” Hua said. “Allowing or not allowing people in is China’s sovereignty ... Hong Kong affairs are a purely internal matter for China.”She said China had lodged a solemn representation with Britain, meaning an official complaint.When asked about the incident on a radio talkshow, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam agreed.“Ultimately, under the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,” Lam said.Asked if immigration controls fell under Hong Kong jurisdiction, Lam said: ”It has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.“If you say everything falls under Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the Basic Law says.”The case has raised questions over the promise of autonomy and the former head of Hong Kong’s civil service turned pro-democracy activist, Anson Chan, said the case was a “serious breach” of the Basic Law.Article 154 of the Basic Law says Hong Kong “may apply immigration controls on entry” of foreigners into Hong Kong.“The Immigration Department must have sought instructions from on high,” she told Reuters. “They (Beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on Hong Kong ... you will not be allowed in.”Amnesty International’s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, suggested China’s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into Hong Kong.“In China if you’re critical of the political system, you’re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing ‘one country, two systems’ should protect against.”Hong Kong’s Immigration Department didn’t immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether China was involved in Rogers’ denial of entry.China has admitted asking a group of British MPs to cancel a visit to Hong Kong in 2014 during the massive pro-democracy protests, of which Joshua Wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days.Hong Kong has, on occasion, barred entry to individuals including dissidents, such as former leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and a Danish sculptor, Jens Galschiot, who made a Tiananmen sculpture."
1312,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court resumed hearing on Thursday the petition filed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Hanif Abbasi seeking the disqualification of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Jahangir Tareen today. Sikandar Bashir Mohmand, Tareen's counsel, is presenting his arguments to the three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar.During the court proceeding, Tareen's counsel said that the court should tell where his client lied in his nomination papers.In response to the question, the chief justice said that Tareen didn’t disclose his ownership of an agriculture land. He added that the counsel should read Representation of People Act's Section-12 to know what action can be taken on misdeclaration.The chief justice said that the court is taking into consideration matters related to integrity and honesty.  The chief justice observed that though the agriculture land in question was on lease, the earnings received from it would qualify as assets and thus had to be shown in the required documents. He added that Tareen did not mention his complete assets in the election forms. The chief justice also remarked that they are trying to understand the law and not giving a final opinion on the matter. At the last hearing on October 11, the bench observed that there is a clear difference in the assets details submitted by the PTI lawmaker in the election nomination papers and the details submitted to the Federal Board of Revenue. Tareen's counsel informed the bench on Tuesday that 18,500 acres were acquired by his client in 2010 on leasePresenting his arguments, Mohmand had informed the court that his client has declared all his assets.He argued that the bench is conducting a tax audit of his client, saying that the petitioner wants to waste time and should be told to take the case to the Federal Board of Revenue.Justice Umar Ata Bandiyal remarked that they are conducting disqualification proceedings at the core of which is the issue of misdeclarations in election nomination forms.When Mohmand objected to the questions in the forms for the electoral nomination papers, the court said it will examine the form and see if the objections hold true.However, the bench observed that regardless of the 'objections', all land holdings should have been mentioned in the form.At the core of the case is the matter of over 18,500 acres that were acquired by Tareen on a lease. Tareen's counsel has said that the PTI leader grows sugar, mangos, and cotton on his farms.The problem arises as the land, being on a lease (thaika), was not mentioned by Tareen when he submitted his nomination forms for the 2013 General Elections. "

1314,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) offered to hold talks with Iraqi authorities on the status of Kurdish airports, border posts and banks, on which they placed restrictions following an independence referendum.Baghdad took the measures in an attempt to isolate the KRG after last month’s referendum.The government in Baghdad, which declared the vote illegal, imposed a ban on direct international flights to the northern region. It also demanded that the KRG hand over control of its border posts, and stopped selling dollars to four Kurdish-owned banks.“To avoid this collective punishment, we invite (Iraqi Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi, again, that we ready to any from of dialogue and negotiations in conformity with the Iraqi Constitution,” the KRG said a statement published overnight.It offered discussions “regarding the crossings, internal trade, providing services to the citizens, the banks and the airports.”The statement marked a change of tack by Kurdish authorities, which on Wednesday accused Iraqi forces and Iranian-trained Iraqi paramilitaries of “preparing a major attack” on the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and near Mosul in northern Iraq. An Iraqi military spokesman denied any attack on Kurdish forces was planned, saying government troops were preparing to oust Islamic State militants from an area near the Syrian border.Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council issued arrest warrants on Wednesday for the chairman of the Kurdish referendum commission and two aides for “violating a valid (Iraqi) court ruling” banning the independence vote as against the Constitution.Neighboring Iran and Turkey back Iraq’s uncompromising stance, fearing the spread of separatism to their own Kurdish populations.Kirkuk, a Kurdish-held multi-ethnic region, has emerged as a flashpoint in the crisis between Baghdad and Erbil as it is claimed by both sides.Iraqi forces and Shi‘ite paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, in areas previously under the control of Islamic State.The area around the border post of al-Qaim, in western Iraq, is the last Iraqi region still under the control of the militants who overran a third of the country in 2014."
1315,"TOKYO: Election campaigning in Japan began in earnest on Tuesday with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe seeking to repel an upstart new party that has pledged to rid the government of cronyism in a challenge to Abe’s near-five year hold on power.The Oct. 22 lower house election pits Abe’s Liberal Democratic Party-led coalition against the less than one-month-old Party of Hope headed by popular Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, a former LDP lawmaker often floated as a possible first female premier.Abe says he needs to renew his mandate to cope with a “national crisis” stemming from North Korea’s nuclear and missile threat and the demographic time-bomb of Japan’s fast-ageing population.The 63-year-old Abe called the poll amid opposition disarray and an uptick in approval ratings that had slid due to a series of scandals over suspected cronyism.But, the sudden emergence of Koike’s party, which also appeals to conservative voters, could upset Abe’s calculation. The main opposition Democratic Party imploded last month and a big chunk of its candidates are running on the Party of Hope ticket.In his first campaign speech Abe attacked the opposition for using populist slogans.“What creates our future is not a boom or slogan. It is policy that creates our future,” Abe said in Fukushima, northeast Japan. “We just cannot afford to lose.”The LDP-led coalition is defending a two-thirds “super majority” in parliament’s lower house, so losing its simple majority would be a major upset.Abe’s LDP had 288 seats in the lower house before it was dissolved for the election, while its junior partner the Komeito had 35. The total number of seats has been cut to 465 from 475.Recent opinion polls show the LDP in the lead and some analysts think Abe could still pull off another landslide victory.A soggy performance for the LDP, however, could stir calls from inside the party to replace Abe or deny him a third term as leader in September 2018, ending his chances of becoming Japan’s longest-serving premier.SHORTAGE OF HOPE?Koike, who defied the LDP last year to run for governor, calls her fledgling party a “reformist, conservative” group free from the fetters of vested interests -- an often popular campaign slogan in Japan.“We have a surplus of things in this country, but what we don’t have is hope for the future,” said Koike, 65, kicking off her campaign outside one of Tokyo’s major train stations.Koike has repeatedly said she won’t run for a seat which would make her eligible for the premiership and has declined to say whom her party would support for the post, leaving the door open to a variety of possible tie-ups including with Abe’s LDP.“The Party of Hope looks a lot like the LDP, but doesn’t have the same problem with vested interests,” said Koji Sasaya, 82, a U.S. resident and longtime LDP supporter who traveled to Japan to vote in the election for Koike’s new party.Others outside the station were less convinced by Koike’s talk of cleaner politics, while trusting Abe to safeguard national security.“I doubt she can deliver politics free from vested interests,” said Minori Hiramatsu, a 28-year-old mother of one who was on her way to a job interview.”Abe has problems domestically, but he is the best person to protect us from North Korean threats.”The Party of Hope echoes Abe’s LDP on security and diplomacy - it backs tough sanctions on North Korea and controversial security legislation enacted in 2015 to expand the military’s role overseas.Koike also agrees with Abe that Japan’s post-war, U.S.-drafted, pacifist constitution should be amended, though not necessarily on what changes are needed.On economic policies, Koike’s party has sought to differentiate itself by calling for an end to nuclear power by 2030 and a freeze on a sales tax hike planned for 2019.Abe wants to keep nuclear power as a key part of Japan’s energy mix, and raise the sales tax and spend more of the revenues on education and child care.A center-left Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, formed from the liberal wing of the failed Democratic Party, is wooing voters dissatisfied with both conservative options."
1316,"YANGON: Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the US ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.“They are not the natives, and the records prove that they were not even called Rohingya but just Bengalis during the colonial period.”The UN human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar security forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.The UN rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced what she called a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military puts sufficient accountability measures in place.The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.Suu Kyi is due make a speech on television later on Thursday.She was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.Insurgents’ opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the attacks, he said.“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said. “They might have fled ... assuming that they would be safer there.”He said it was an exaggeration to say the number fleeing to Bangladesh was “very large” and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.He did not elaborate, or say how many people he thought had fled, but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community.UN political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit Myanmar on Friday.Min Aung Hlaing repeated a promise from Suu Kyi that refugees would be accepted back under an agreement with Bangladesh in the early 1990s, adding that details were being worked out.Many refugees doubt their chances of going home fearing they will not be able to prove their right to return."
1317,"Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s visit to Afghanistan on September 2 was yet another attempt by the two sides to stop further deterioration in ties. This was the first interaction at the highest level between the two neighbouring countries since May 31, when an explosives-laden truck in Kabul killed around 150 people and wounded 300. Soon after, the Afghan government alleged that the Haqqani network had planned the bombing at its safe havens in Pakistan. Islamabad rejected the allegation. The incident only deepened the mistrust that characterizes the uneasy relationship. One immediate outcome of General Bajwa’s visit to Kabul was the change in tone and attitude of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. He had been publicly showing hostility toward Pakistan for months and once even said that Afghanistan and Pakistan were not brotherly countries. But on the day of the visit, the statement issued by his office quoted him as saying that the two were friends, further adding that the visit by Pakistan’s top military and intelligence officials to Afghanistan marked a ‘new season’ in the relationship. The discussions during General Bajwa’s visit could possibly have something to do with Ghani’s changed attitude. However, it is still unclear whether any promises were made or agreement reached on contentious issues. That may be unlikely because the differences between the two sides are acute and certain disputes are old and almost intractable. Still, a new beginning could be made and the wish, jointly expressed by the two sides to forget the past and work hard for a better future, is meaningful. Ghani, it seems, is using the window of opportunity provided after US President Trump’s new Afghanistan and South Asia policy. The Afghan President knows that Pakistan is under pressure since Trump’s strong criticism of it allegedly harbouring terrorists. He may have calculated that Pakistan will now be willing to bring the Afghan Taliban leaders to the negotiations table or take action against them and the Haqqani network. Bajwa also took along with him Lt. Gen. Naveed Mukhtar, the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) - an organization that the Afghan government habitually blames for almost every act of violence in Afghanistan by linking it with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network. The Pakistan Army chief had a one-on-one meeting with the Afghan President before their aides joined them to discuss a host of issues, including security in the region, bilateral relations, peace and stability, anti-terror efforts and matters concerning business and transit trade. Dr. Omar Zakhilwal, the Afghan ambassador in Pakistan, who boasts of playing a role in facilitating Bajwa’s visit, termed the meeting between the two leaders as ‘constructive and encouraging.’ From the statements issued by the two sides in Kabul and Rawalpindi, it was obvious that Ghani had repeated his demand of Pakistan taking practical steps for enabling peace and stability to return to Afghanistan. He also wanted to set up task teams in different sectors to form a clear cooperation framework and establish a monitoring mechanism to make sure the two countries fulfill their promises. Bajwa, on the other hand, renewed Pakistan’s offer of intelligence sharing and training Afghan military officers. His predecessor, General (r) Raheel Sharif, had made similar propositions and even managed to oversee the signing of a memorandum of understanding for intelligence-sharing between the ISI and the Afghan intelligence agency, National Directorate of Security (NDS). But Kabul buckled under pressure by opponents of the deal, and failed to get it implemented. As for the training of Afghan military officers in Pakistan, Ghani despite domestic opposition sent six cadets to study at the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul, Abbottabad, before halting the process. In comparison, about 1,100 Afghan military officers are being sent to India for training annually, much to Pakistan’s concern. While Bajwa’s visit to Kabul has raised expectations of a gradual improvement in Pak-Afghan relations, there is a realization that achieving a breakthrough won’t be easy. There is wide divergence of views between Islamabad and Kabul. For example, Pakistan considers India a spoiler and a destabilizing force. However, Afghanistan is convinced that India is a stabilizing force and is backing Trump’s call to New Delhi to play a bigger role in the war-ravaged country’s development. Bridging the gap would require overcoming the distrust that has plagued relations between Islamabad and Kabul. It would be worthwhile if the two countries can take steps to improve their relations bilaterally instead of being pressured and arm-twisted by the Trump administration to do its bidding. A recent Afghan special forces raid in Nangarhar province reportedly killing 7 Jamaatul-Ahraar fighters has come as a pleasant surprise to Pakistan’s military authorities as it is probably the second time that Kabul has targeted Pakistani militants based in Afghanistan. This augurs well for the future of Pak-Afghan relations, though Pakistan will like more such operations and Afghanistan in return will want similar action by Pakistani forces against Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network.Yusufzai is the Resident Editor of The News International in PeshawarNote: The views expressed in the article are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."

Shah said that the issue brought disgrace to the country.The committee ordered to forward the matter to the National Accountability Bureau.It emerged recently that the country’s flagship carrier is slipping further into losses by each passing day, and the management appears to have no clue how to saving the ‘sinking Titanic’.Earlier today, PM's Aviation Adviser Sardar Mehtab Abbasi said the airline’s losses have surged to $4 billion as neither the government nor the airline’s management or its employees is ready to own it.PIA losses have surged to $4 billion, says PM's aviation advisorAbbasi said that the 'sale' of a PIA aircraft to a German museum — a decision taken by the former German CEO of PIA Bernd Hildenbrand, was a ""mistake.""""Investigation into the 'sale' is still ongoing in Germany,"" the aviation adviser said, adding that the aircraft was sold along with its engine as well as other valuable machinery."
1319,"KARACHI: Head coach of SSGC cricket team, Atiq-uz-Zaman on Tuesday lashed out at the Pakistan team management for “misusing” fast bowler Mohammad Amir, who broke down towards the end of the Test series against Sri Lanka in UAE and was ruled out of the upcoming ODI series. “The team management did not handle Mohammad Amir properly,” the departmental coach said, claiming that the bowler, who has represented SSGC in domestic cricket, was “misused” and “overworked”. “He has been playing non-stop cricket,” Atiq-uz-Zaman pointed out, referring to Amir’s stint for Essex in English county cricket over the past few months. “Amir has broken down. He plays with [tapes and bandages] on his body,” the coach lamented.“He should only be made to play ODIs and T20s,” Atiq-uz-Zaman added. Amir was ruled out of the five-match ODI series against Sri Lanka due to a stress injury in his right shin. He was taken off the field after bowling 19.3 overs in Sri Lanka’s first innings on Saturday, the second day of Dubai Test.A statement from the PCB said the pacer underwent MRI scans after complaints of pain in his shin and following the scans, he has been advised a rest of two to three weeks."
1320,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) is hearing the Punjab government’s appeal against an earlier order of the court directing the release of the Model Town tragedy inquiry report.Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh is heading a three-member bench hearing the government’s plea against the single bench’s earlier order.Presenting his arguments, the provincial government’s counsel, Khawaja Harris, said the single bench delivered its order without hearing the government’s side.He questioned the hearing of the writ petition by the single bench when a similar matter was already being heard by a full bench.The counsel for the victims, Azhar Siddique, said Harris is implicating the honourable high court in his arguments. At this, a verbal clash ensued between the two counsel, leading the court to admonish the petitioners’ counsel to let Harris complete his arguments and then speak.The Punjab government had filed an intra-court appeal against the September 21 decision of a single-bench ordering the release of the Model Town inquiry report, authored by LHC Justice Baqar Najafi. On September 21, Justice Mazahar Ali Naqvi ordered the Punjab home secretary to make public the report, authored by LHC Justice Baqar Najafi, on the Model Town killings and provide a copy to the families of those killed and injured in the 2014 incident.The government in its appeal against the decision, challenged the jurisdiction of the single bench to give its decision on the report, on the grounds that as many as eight identical petitions on the same matter were already pending before a full bench.In the appeal, the government said it was neither asked by the single bench to file any reply nor was put on notice on the matter, adding that it was also not given any opportunity to explain its position on the case."

The plane's crew did not have time to eject and died,"" the spokesman said.He did not clarify how many people died, but the Su-24 usually has a crew of two.""According to a report from the scene of the accident, the reason could be a technical failure,"" he added.Russia has staged air strikes in Syria in support of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad since 2015.On Tuesday, the defence ministry said Russian planes are currently carrying out 150 strikes per day in eastern Syria against Daesh militants.The latest casualties put the toll of Russian servicemen officially reported killed in Syria at 37.Last month a Russian general was killed near the eastern city of Deir Ezzor, where Russian special forces are participating in the regime's ground offensive."
1323,"LONDON: Iran said on Tuesday that the United States would be “joining the terrorists’ camp” if it chose to designate its elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) a terrorist organisation.US President Donald Trump is expected to announce this week his final decision on how he wants to contain Iran’s regional influence. He is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp as a terrorist organization.“The world should be thankful to the Revolutionary Guards for its fight against terrorists, especially against Daesh (Islamic State),” Iranian government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference broadcast live on state television.“So by taking a stance against the Revolutionary Guards and designating it a terrorist group, the Americans would be joining the terrorists’ camp,” he added.Trump is expected to “decertify” a landmark 2015 deal Iran struck with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for the lifting of most international sanctions.Trump’s announcement would stop short of pulling out of the agreement but give Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.US sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group.IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on Sunday that if Washington designated the Guards a terrorist organization, they “will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.”Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said on Monday that Tehran would give a “firm, decisive and crushing” response if the United States goes ahead with such a plan."

1325,"Last month, German chancellor, Angela Merkel, succeeded in retaining her post for an unprecedented fourth time. But her crown of victory has a few thorns this time.Although she won, Merkel’s Christian Democratic Party saw a startling reduction in its vote bank. The party got only 33 per cent of the casted votes - its lowest in decades. Even more damaging was the reason that the German elections made international headlines. For the first time, since the defeat of the Nazis in Germany, the right-wing populist Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party raked in 11 per cent of the votes and walked right into the parliament.The AfD is a party formed by university professors, who believe that Germany should not be apologetic about its past and should instead remember the country's World War II soldiers with pride. In its election campaign promise, it demanded the closure of borders, strict action against Muslims and had publicly allied itself with France's far-right National Front.So how did this fringe party become mainstream?Now that the official results are in, it seems that close to a million voters, who cast ballots in favour of the AfD were previously aligned with Merkel’s party. The right-wing leaders also cut into the vote bank of the Social Democratic Party and the secular party, The Left. This may signify that voters’ confidence in traditional parties has been shaken.In previous elections, the Christian Democrat Party and the Social Democrat Party would pull in a total of 80 per cent of the votes, combined. While this year the two parties together only got 53 per cent of the ballots.Post the Second World War, whenever Germany’s economic woes became evident, left leaning parties always benefited. But this time, it seems they are drifting towards the right and their blinkered agendas. It would be prudent to remember here that the beneficiary of Germany’s economic crisis of the 1930s was Hitler’s Nazi Party.Earlier this year when Emmanuel Macron won the French elections, political watchers breathe a collective sigh of relief, sanguine that extremist politics was on its way out. There was also hope that Macron and Merkel will steer the European Union out of trouble and economic and political reforms will be enacted.But the results of the German elections point to more problem looming on the horizon. With fewer seats this time, Merkel will be forced to form a coalition with the Green Party and the Liberal Free Democratic party, both of whom oppose Merkel bitterly on many issues, especially the European Union. Similarly, with the AfD present in the parliament, it will be difficult for Merkel to provide any relief to the economically hard-pressed countries such as Greece and Spain.Outside Germany, France is also battling its own right-wingers pushing to sit in the parliament. In Austria, the extremist Freedom Party will be part of the ruling coalition. While, Jobbik – Movement for a Better Hungary has become the second most popular party in its country. Even in socialist countries, including Sweden and Denmark, the right wing is becoming stronger by the day.For this uprising, the socialist democratic leaders are to blame. They suffer from intellectual sterility and lack new ideas to tackle old problems. If this trend continues then pretty soon right-wing parties will be ruling over Europe and sitting in the European Union.

1326,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court ordered on Tuesday the relevant authorities to file a case to recover the director of Rumi Forum and former principal of Pak-Turk Schools, Mesut Kacmaz, who along with his wife and two daughters, went missing from his residence in Wapda Town on September 27.The court was hearing petitions, filed by Turkish citizen Orhan and others, challenging the deportation of teachers and staff of the Pak-Turk Schools. A petition had also been filed by the missing family.No FIR has been filed in the case as yet and the whereabouts of the family are unknown.The court in its written order directed the government to stop harassment against and provide protection to the staff and teachers. It ordered to put their names on Exit Control List (ECL) so as to stop their deportation.The LHC also directed the interior ministry to ask intelligence agencies to submit a reply on whether the Turkish family is in their custody besides submitting a list of all missing persons.The court on the request of the federal government’s lawyer Imran Aziz gave until October 16 — the date of the next hearing — to submit a detailed reply.Aziz informed the court that the government has already written to the intelligence agencies in this regard and a reply would be submitted once it is received.Saddar SP Rizwan Gondal informed the court that the police are still clueless about the family. Sources said Kacmaz is currently on ‘UNHCR asylum-seeker certificate’ since November 2016 when Pakistan revoked visas of staffers working with the Pak-Turk Schools on the request of the Turkish government. Turkey has blamed US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen for the failed coup in July 2016 and launched a crackdown on his supporters in the country and globally. The ‘kidnapped’ director of Rumi Forum was also active against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Pakistan on social media, sources said.Since the attempted coup, Turkey has fired 21,000 teachers and arrested hundreds of academics. In a chain of 28 Pak-Turk Schools and Colleges in Pakistan, around 11,000 students are studying. The project was launched in 1995 by the Pak-Turk Foundation."
1327,"The metropolis was recently racked by multiple knife attacks on women, leading to fear as the police continues to be baffled by the attacker’s identity.The media coverage of such issues is something to be discussed at length — especially as it is a tool which has the influence to impact minds.The attacks which started from September 25, were initially reported on a three to four kilometers stretch of Gulistan-e-Jauhar. The attacker then increased his area of activity, extending it to adjacent the neighbourhood of Gulshan-e-Iqbal.Geo News reporter Ahmer Rehman said the CCTV cameras are of such poor-quality that they do not aid in the investigation, for instance, the attacker’s face and number plate are extremely hard to figure out.Ahmer who actively partook in the coverage was of the opinion that police jumping to action was primarily due to the media’s extensive coverage of the incidents.SSP East Samiullah Soomro said the police are conducting overnight raids and people are quite cooperative as well.The police official, however, implored the public to not crank call regarding the attacker as it diverts the attention of police.Senior analyst Mazhar Abbas said that news should never be suppressed, although it should be borne in mind that journalism is done in public interest.Presentation and the extent of coverage are vital aspects in highlighting an issue, he said.Abbas was of the opinion that the media should have slightly underplayed the issue while giving an example that the image of an unknown man with a huge knife invokes terror.“If the attacker intends to terrorize then he gets successful in his intention due to the media hype,” said Mazhar Abbas.Bureau Chief Geo News Karachi Faheem Siddiqui strongly supported highlighting the issue. He said that if the media had not highlighted the issue then the police would not have been beefed up and it would have been downplayed.On a positive note, even though the attacker has evaded authorities till now, the graph of street crimes has visibly gone down.Anchor Asma Shirazi said that media coverage is of paramount importance and was of the opinion that the issue has been over sensationalised as Karachi is the hub of ratings.Another noteworthy point she raised was that words used by media such as ‘Chalawa’ etc are not even used in the dictionary and the visuals created over-hype and exacerbated the issue."
1328,"An astonishing discovery was made by Uppsala University researchers in Sweden recently, according to which they found Arabic characters woven into funeral clothes of the Viking graves. The words were ‘Allah’ and ‘Ali’.The recent findings have opened a gateway of questions regarding the civilisation and the influence of Islam on the Vikings, whose age spanned from late 8th century to the mid-11th century.The clothes, belonging to the 9th and 10th century, were left ignored as they were considered as conventional Viking grave clothes.The researchers were trying to reconstruct textile patterns for an upcoming exhibition at the museum of Enkoping when the Kufic character patterns were discovered on the silk clothes.Annika Larsson, a researcher in textile archaeology at the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Uppsala University, spoke to Swedish science portal Forskning and said: “Presumably, Viking Age burial customs were influenced by Islam and the idea of an eternal life in Paradise after death"".She said that the possibility of the graves being of Muslims cannot be ruled out.The team is now collaborating with the university's department for immunology, genetics and pathology to ascertain the geographic origins of the bodies inside those graves."
1329,"DUBAI: Pakistan lost to Sri Lanka by 68 runs in the second Test on the fifth and final day in Dubai on Tuesday. Sri Lanka won the two match series 2-0 and Pakistan suffered its first series loss since the team started playing its home matches in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Pakistan faltered chasing 317 and were bowled out for 248 in their second innings with Dilruwan Perera finishing with 5-98.Asad Shafiq fought hard during his 112-run knock -- his 11th Test hundred -- and together with his skipper Sarfraz Ahmed (68) added 173 for the sixth wicket.But once their partnership was broken Sri Lanka, having already won the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi, quickly closed in on the victory.This is Pakistan's first series defeat at their adopted home of United Arab Emirates (UAE) in seven years. They had won five of the previous nine, with four drawn.Pakistan were forced to play in the neutral venues of the UAE following the deadly terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore in 2009.This is also Pakistan's first home defeat since losing to South Africa 1-0 in 2007, a series held on their grounds, and only the second whitewash in their history.They previously suffered a 3-0 defeat against Australia, a series also played at neutral venues in Colombo and UAE in 2002.Shafiq was the ninth man out when he edged paceman Suranga Lakmal to slip where Kusal Mendis took a low diving catch to end all Pakistan's hopes of an upset win.Shafiq's 253-minute knock had 10 boundaries but he again failed to help Pakistan cross the line, just like his 137 in the lost cause against Australia at Brisbane last year.Pakistan had looked to the overnight partnership of Shafiq and Ahmed to guide them to the winning target after resuming at 198-5, needing another 119 for victory.Both Shafiq and Ahmed had lucky escapes but Perera finally broke the resistance when Ahmed was caught off a miscued sweep at deep fine leg by Nuwan Pradeep.Ahmed hit five boundaries during his 130-ball knock.Shafiq brought up his hundred with a paddled sweep single off Perera and was reprived on the same score when Dimuth Karunaratne dropped a low catch of the same bowler.Perera then completed his five-wicket haul when he trapped Mohammad Amir -- unable to bowl in the second innings with a shin injury -- leg before for four, bringing Sri Lanka within three wickets of victory.Yasir Shah was cleaned up by Rangana Herath while the victory was brought up when Herath had number 10 Wahab Riaz caught gleefully by skipper Dinesh Chandimal for one.Sri Lanka had gained a decisive 220-run lead by scoring 482 in the first innings on the back of Karunaratne's career best 196 and then bowled Pakistan out for 262.Resuming at 198-5 Pakistan lost Sarfraz Ahmed for 65 while Asad Shafiq scored 112 for his 11th Test century."

The emerging category player for all teams will be announced later.This enabled the sixth and the newest side in the competition, Multan Sultans to pick a maximum of nine players from each of the four categories in the pre-draft, comprising players not retained by the other franchises.The veteran Sri Lankan batting master class, Kumar Sangakkara was picked up in the diamond category as a player and mentor alongside T20 specialist, Sohail Tanvir.Sharing his views on the addition of Kumar Sangakkara to the franchise, Multan Sultans Director Cricket Wasim Akram said, “Kumar is a master class, and over the time he has outshined as one of the most consistent T20 players, be it his blistering strokes or splendid glove work behind the stumps, he has contributed amazingly to the T20 format across the globe”“His presence in the dug-out in itself will be a huge morale booster, and will provide an excellent learning experience for the youngsters who will have the privilege of sharing the dressing room with him,” he concluded.The Gold category features the pace duo of Mohammad Irfan alongside lethal pacer Junaid Khan who is well known for his accuracy in the shorter format of the game.Whereas the silver category features the mystery leggie from FATA, Irfan Khan, all-rounder Kashif Bhatti and middle-order batsman Sohaib Maqsood."

1333,"Two US astronauts installed a high-definition video camera at the International Space Station Tuesday and made more progress on repairs to the lab's robotic arm, NASA said.NASA spokesman Rob Navias described the camera equipment as offering ""new eyes"" to the orbiting outpost, as live video showed astronaut Randy Bresnik in sharp detail, floating in his white spacesuit.The previous camera had aged, and was tinting images pink. Another camera outside the ISS, nicknamed ""Old Yeller"" because of its yellow hues, is set to be replaced on the next spacewalk October 18.The spacewalk was the second in five days for Bresnik and his NASA colleague Mark Vande Hei.The spacewalk formally began when the duo switched their spacesuits to battery power at 1156 GMT, then floated out into the vacuum of space, NASA said. It ended six hours and 26 minutes later.On their spacewalk Thursday, the pair replaced the latching end of the 57-foot-long (17-meter) Canadian-made arm, called Canadarm2.On Tuesday, they lubricated its latching end effector.The robotic arm was installed at the orbiting outpost 16 years ago, and recently stopped gripping effectively.Astronauts need it in working order so it can capture incoming cargo ships that ferry supplies to the crew living in orbit. The next US shipment arrives in November."

1335,"Children who are bullied during their pre-teen years may experience mental health issues like anxiety and depression, but a study of twins suggests that some victims may not experience lasting psychological problems.Researchers examined data on about 11,000 twins born in England and Wales from 1994 to 1996. The youth completed assessments on their exposure to bullying when they were 11 and 14 years old, and they had mental health evaluations when they were 11 and 16 years old.At age 11, kids who reported bullying were more likely than children who weren’t victims of peer victimization to report anxiety, depression, hyperactivity, inattention and conduct problems, the study found.Some effects appeared to diminish over time, however. After five years, there no longer appeared to be a link between bullying and anxiety, but an association persisted for issues like cognitive disorganization and paranoid thoughts.“Most children will get better,” said Judy Silberg, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.But it would be a mistake to assume all psychological problems associated with childhood bullying go away by age 16, Silberg said by email.“There is a proportion of children who continue to have problems,” Silberg said. “Population studies demonstrate a persistent pattern of adverse effects, particularly in depression, anxiety and suicidal behaviour as far as adulthood in those that have been bullied in childhood.”For the current study, researchers focused on twins because this might help minimize the chances that genetics or other factors like home life are influencing the impact of bullying on kids, Jean-Baptiste Pingault of University College London in the UK and his colleagues note in JAMA Psychiatry.Because reports of mental health problems appeared to lessen as years passed after bullying incidents occurred, the authors conclude that children may be resilient and able to rebound from this type of mistreatment and suggest that parents and schools should focus resources on fostering resilience.The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how long the effects of childhood bullying can last, however, and it’s possible certain children may still have long-term psychological problems after being victimized as kids, the authors acknowledge.“The effects of bullying at age 11 on anxiety and depression at age 16 is what diminishes,” said Bonnie Leadbeater, a psychology researcher at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the study.“You cannot interpret this as supporting a more general statement that the effects of bullying lessen over time,” Leadbeater said by email.Because the study only assessed bullying and mental health at two points in time, it doesn’t provide a complete picture of how these two things may be related, Leadbeater said.“Bullying may be episodic or chronic, and the limited assessment of bullying may severely underestimate the effects of chronic bullying on mental health and behavioural problems,” Leadbeater added."
1336,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump suggested challenging licenses for NBC and other broadcast news networks on Wednesday, a salvo that followed reports his own secretary of state had called him a “moron” after a discussion of the US nuclear arsenal.“With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!” Trump — a Republican — wrote in a post on Twitter.Trump and his supporters have repeatedly used the term “fake news” to cast doubt on critical media reports about his administration, often without providing any evidence to support their case that the reports were untrue.Trump kept up his criticism of the media in an appearance with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, saying, “It is frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.”Any move to challenge media companies’ licenses, however, would likely face significant hurdles.The Federal Communications Commission — an independent federal agency — does not license broadcast networks but issues them to individual broadcast stations that are renewed on a staggered basis for eight-year periods.Comcast Corp — which owns NBC Universal — also owns 11 broadcast stations, including outlets in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, and Chicago.A Comcast spokeswoman referred the questions to NBC, which did not respond immediately.ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, declined to comment as well.Shares in media companies fell after Trump’s tweet, potentially reflecting concerns the war of words could escalate.Comcast, Disney, CBS Corp, and Twenty-First Century Fox dipped 0.8 percent, 1.4 percent, 1.2 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively.Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner called the market response a “short-term irrational knee-jerk reaction” and said Trump faced essentially insurmountable hurdles to getting licenses pulled.A spokesman for FCC chairman Ajit Pai did not immediately comment.Gordon Smith — the chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters — defended the media’s free speech rights.“It is contrary to this fundamental right for any government official to threaten the revocation of an FCC license simply because of a disagreement with the reporting of a journalist,” he said in a statement.Numerous Democrats criticized Trump and urged Pai to denounce Trump’s comments.Senator Ed Markey wrote Pai on Wednesday asking him to “withstand any urges from President Trump to harm the news media and infringe upon the First Amendment”, a reference to the US Constitution’s free speech and press freedom guarantee.Democratic US Representative Frank Pallone said Trump “seemed to threaten broadcasters’ licenses only because he disagreed with their reporting. This threat alone could intimidate the press and lead to skewed and unfair reporting”.FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel responded to Trump by tweeting a link to an FCC fact sheet. “Not how it works,” she said on Twitter.According to a fact sheet on the FCC website, when reviewing licenses the agency must determine if a renewal is in the public interest.The FCC said in the fact sheet it expects “station licensees to be aware of the important problems and issues facing their local communities and to foster public understanding by presenting programming that relates to those local issues”.The agency does not issue similar licenses for cable networks like CNN and MSNBC or regulate internet news or other websites.The FCC has said the First Amendment “expressly prohibits the commission from censoring broadcast matter” and that its role “in overseeing program content is very limited"".In the early 1970s, the then-President Richard Nixon and his top aides discussed using the FCC’s license renewal process as a way of punishing the Washington Post for its coverage of the Watergate burglary that ultimately brought down his presidency.NBC News has reported on tensions between Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and has said Trump sought a dramatic increase in the US nuclear arsenal during a meeting with national security advisers in July.NBC reported Tillerson made his “moron” comment after that meeting.Trump on Saturday also suggested he should get “equal time” because of what he described as late-night television hosts’ “anti-Trump” material.The FCC’s equal time rules apply in limited cases to airtime for political candidates and not to criticism of elected leaders.Trump may have been referring to the “Fairness Doctrine” that was designed to ensure broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on public issues.Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration eliminated it in 1987."
1337,"BRUSSELS: Nerves are fraying in the Brexit talks, negotiators are trying to work out if the other side is bluffing about walking away, and a ticking clock is fast narrowing British options come March 2019.British Chancellor Philip Hammond echoed recent EU assertions when he said that a transition period to some new relationship was a “wasting asset”, the value of which would “diminish significantly” for both sides if its form remains unclear to businesses much after the start of the new year.As negotiators in Brussels make little progress before Prime Minister Theresa May meets EU leaders next week, a warning about a breakdown in talks from a minister seen strongly to favour a business-friendly “bespoke” transition out of the EU came a day after the EU summit chair spoke of a similar new year deadline.Donald Tusk said on Tuesday that if London fails to settle divorce terms by December, and so unlock talks on the transition and future trade pact, then the EU would reconsider its objectives. That reflects mounting doubts across Europe that any legal exit deal can be struck.The longer the standoff goes on, EU negotiators said, the more Britain’s choice come March 30, 2019, will be between the “hard Brexit”, by which it will simply quit all EU systems and be treated like, say, Australia, and a virtual status quo, staying in most EU systems, without voting rights, rather like Norway.“The closer we get, the less there is to discuss about a transition and the more it just goes to a standstill transition, with Britain still in everything, but without a vote,” one said.“Pretty soon,” said another, “It will be Norway or nothing.”While all such commentary reflects the sides’ jockeying for negotiating advantage, the evidence this week is that they remain far apart and are getting tetchy. May and the EU traded jabs over whose court “the ball” is in after the prime minister made concessions in a speech at Florence on September 22.Behind closed doors, British negotiators voiced outraged surprise that her offer was seen as insufficient to launch talks on the future relationship.“It’s hard to say it was genuine,” one EU official said of the show of emotion. “It’s a form of pressure.”Businesses are sounding the alarm. A German industry federation warned members to start preparing for a “very hard Brexit”.A senior representative of London’s financial services industry told a Brussels audience this week that a legal transition agreement must be reached by the end of this year.“Most importantly, it must reflect the status quo,” said Catherine McGuinness of the City of London Corporation. “There is no feasibility in asking firms to transition to a transition. If uncertainty continues, businesses will vote with their feet.”Hammond ruled out budgeting — yet — for more customs and border facilities, and few on the continent believe threats of a walkout they say would hurt Britain more than them.So leaders will watch May’s struggle to unite her government and sit tight. One senior EU diplomat said British counterparts were in such a weak position that “sometimes I feel sorry them”.For many in Brussels, that makes a virtual status quo after Brexit the increasingly likely outcome, “In March 2019, Britain will formally leave,” said another EU official.“But de facto most of the existing arrangements will remain… They will have their celebration of ‘independence’ and then we will sit down to talking business again.”May insists a two-year transition period is enough to agree on a new free trade pact, but many question that.Former Irish prime minister John Bruton has recommended an alternative to either no deal at all or a virtual status quo transition — just keeping Britain fully in the EU for four years beyond 2019.Arguing that the two-year deadline set by Article 50 of the EU treaty raises the risk of talks collapsing, and that agreeing first a transition and then another accord is complex, Bruton said this week that Britain and the EU should agree to a six-year negotiating period, with Britain only leaving in 2023.Neither wants any extension.“The present tight time frame… increases the likelihood of miscalculation and of the UK leaving the EU with no deal at all,"" Bruton, however, warned."
1338,"Firefighters facing a resurgence of high winds on Wednesday struggled to halt wildfires that have killed at least 21 people, destroyed 3,500 structures and left hundreds missing in chaotic evacuations across northern California’s wine country.Nearly two dozen blazes spanning eight counties have charred around 170,000 acres (68,797 hectares). Flames erupted on Sunday night when gale force winds toppled power lines across the region, possibly igniting one of the deadliest wildfire outbreaks in California history.Flames were spread rapidly by hot, dry “Diablo” winds - similar to Southern California’s Santa Ana winds - that blew into northern California toward the Pacific on Sunday night.The official cause of ignition has not been determined. But electric wires knocked down by those same winds may have sparked the conflagration, according to Daniel Berlant, spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).”That is definitely a possibility, he told Reuters. “Power lines are a common cause of fires during wind events.”Berlant said some of the victims in northern California were asleep when the fast-moving fires broke out, igniting their homes before they could escape.At least 20,000 people remained under evacuation as the fires raged largely unchecked for a third day, belching palls of smoke that engulfed the region and drifted south over the San Francisco Bay area, where some residents donned face masks.The entire town of Calistoga, a Napa Valley community of some 5,000 residents spared from advancing flames the first night of the fire, was ordered evacuated on Wednesday evening, as the county sheriff’s office warned that conditions had worsened.More than 550 people were still reported unaccounted for in Sonoma County on Wednesday morning, said Jennifer Laroque, a county emergency operations centre spokeswoman.It was unclear how many of the missing might be actual fire victims rather than evacuees who merely failed to check in with authorities after fleeing their homes. Officials urged displaced residents to let their family members know they were safe.The Sonoma County town of Santa Rosa, the largest city in the wine country region, was particularly hard hit by one of the fiercest blazes, the so-called Tubbs fire. Block after block of some neighbourhoods were virtually obliterated with nothing left but charred debris, broken walls, chimneys and the steel frames of burned-out cars.“It’s like driving through a war zone,” J J Murphy, 22, one of the thousands of evacuees, said of the area around his home in the Sonoma Valley community of Glen Ellen.thousands of evacuees, said of the area around his home in the Sonoma Valley community of Glen Ellen.Murphy, five relatives, a bird, a dog and two cats piled into their camper van to flee on Monday, he said.“It’s crazy how in just a few hours a place I’ve recognised all my life I can’t recognise,” he said at a roadside food stop in the town of Sonoma.In the town of Napa on the first night of a blaze dubbed the Atlas fire, nearly 50 people who were in danger of being overrun by flames were rescued by the crews of two California Highway Patrol helicopters working in tandem during a seven-hour aerial evacuation operation.The weather gave firefighters a bit of a respite on Tuesday as cooler temperatures, lower winds and coastal fog enabled them to make headway against the flames. Fire crews laboured on Wednesday to strengthen containment lines as winds picked up again.“We’re not out of the woods and we’re not going to be out of the woods for a great number of days to come,” Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said at a news conference.In addition to high winds, fires were stoked by an abundance of thick brush and other vegetation left tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather and months with little or no rainfall. The cause of the fires remained under investigation.tinder dry by a summer of hot, dry weather and months with little or no rainfall. The cause of the fires remained under investigation.Matt Nauman, a spokesman for the region’s main utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, acknowledged that fallen power lines were widespread during the “historic wind event,” which he said packed some hurricane-strength gusts in excess of 75 miles per hour.At least 11 people were killed by the Tubbs fire in Sonoma County alone, officials said. It is the deadliest single California wildfire since 2003, when the so-called Cedar fire killed 15 people in San Diego, according to state data.The latest overall death toll of 21, including six fatalities in Mendocino County and two more each in Napa and Yuba counties, marks the greatest loss of life from a California wildfire event in 26 years, since 25 people perished in a firestorm that swept the Oakland Hills in October 1991."
1339,"Mount Shinmoedake in southern Japan erupted for the first time in six years Wednesday, shooting a plume of ash several hundred metres into the air and sparking warnings to local residents.People were ordered to stay away from the volcano after it rumbled to life at 5:34 am (2034 GMT Tuesday) as Japan's Meteorological Agency said air blasts caused by the eruption could shatter windows.""The ash plume reached a height of 300 metres (1,000 feet) when the volcano erupted,"" an agency official told AFP, adding that the eruption would continue and ""become more active"".Ash deposits would spread as far as two kilometres from the crater, the agency warned.Authorities raised its alert to level three, meaning that locals should avoid approaching the volcano.

1340,"NEW YORK: Major stock indexes edged up to post record closing highs on Wednesday with sector moves in the S&P 500 showing preference toward so-called defensive stocks.While Wall Street reaction was muted to minutes of the most recent Federal Reserve policy meeting, a report that a market-friendly candidate was being pushed as successor to Janet Yellen at the helm of the US central bank helped indexes close near the highs of the day.Real estate, utilities, and consumer staples were among S&P 500 sectors that posted gains, while financials were pressured by a slip in Treasury yields and industrials also fell.“You’ve got sector rotation grinding the indexes higher and it’s hard to see what stops that,” Art Hogan — the chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York — said.Federal Reserve policymakers had a prolonged debate about the prospects of a pickup in inflation during their September meeting, but many policymakers still felt that another rate increase this year “was likely to be warranted”.“Nothing changes the opinion that the Fed is likely to hike rates after the December meeting,” Hogan said.Stocks ended near session highs after a report from Politico said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was pushing president Donald Trump to name Jerome Powell — seen as a safe pick for financial markets — as the next Federal Reserve chairman.“The market prefers status quo,” Ken Polcari — the director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York — said.“Everyone knows rates are going up but they prefer the policy that Yellen has laid out. Maybe the market is telling you it thinks it’s going to be status quo.”Powell is seen as closer policy-wise to Yellen than another front-runner, Kevin Warsh.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 42.21 points (or 0.18 percent) to end at 22,872.89, the S&P 500 gained 4.6 points (or 0.18 percent) to 2,555.24, and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.30 points (or 0.25 percent) to 6,603.55.Gains in Wal-Mart and Johnson & Johnson nudged the Dow Jones Industrial Average to another record high but declines in financials kept gains on the S&P 500 in check.J&J rose 2.1 percent to $136.65 after Jefferies upgraded the stock to “buy,” saying the company’s pharma division would help it top analysts’ profit estimates.The consumer staples sector got a boost from gains in Wal-Mart, which rose 1.9 percent, as well as from Kroger, which jumped 1.2 percent to $20.78 after news that it was exploring the sale of its nearly 800 convenience stores.Banks take the focus as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup report results on Thursday, with analysts warning that results in the sector will largely be held back by low trading volumes compared with a year earlier.“Third-quarter results of large banks are expected to be tepid,” Stephen Biggar — an analyst at Argus Research — said. “Trading revenue (will be) down due to low volatility and loan growth remaining flat to slightly negative.”With the S&P 500 up 14 percent in 2017, investors are betting on strong earnings growth across the S&P 500.Wunderlich’s Hogan said the catalyst to stop the grind higher in stocks would be “some big names missing the mark in earnings, away from any hurricane-related explanations”.General Electric fell 1.2 percent to $23.07 after JPMorgan said a dividend cut was “increasingly likely” and lowered its price target on the stock.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favoured advancers.The S&P 500 posted 48 new 52-week highs and nine new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 147 new highs and 28 new lows.About 5.67 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, compared with the 6.1 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions."
1341,"WASHINGTON: The leaders of the US House of Representatives Intelligence Committee’s Russia investigation said Wednesday they intend to publicly release thousands of politically divisive Facebook ads purchased by Russia during last year’s presidential election.Representatives Mike Conaway and Adam Schiff told reporters after meeting with Facebook Inc Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg that they were working with the company to release the ads publicly.“We’ve asked for Facebook’s help to scrub any personally identifiable information, but it’s our hope that when that concludes we can release them publicly,” Schiff said.Conaway said it was unlikely the ads would be released before Facebook will testify to Congress about Russian interference on November 1.The committee — one of the main congressional panels investigating allegations of Russian meddling — recently received more than 3,000 politically divisive ads believed to have been purchased by Russia.The social media company found them on its network and said they appeared in the months before and after the vote. Lawmakers in both parties had previously said they wanted to make the ads public.Officials from Facebook and the committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sandberg’s meeting in Congress came as the world’s largest social media network — joined by a growing list of other major Internet firms — finds itself on the defensive in Washington amid renewed scrutiny about how Moscow sought to use their platforms to influence the 2016 presidential election.Sandberg is in Washington this week meeting with other lawmakers as well. She is expected to give a live interview with the news website Axios on Thursday.In addition to Facebook, Alphabet’s Google and Twitter have recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive.All three companies have been asked to testify publicly about Russian interference before both the House and Senate intelligence panels on November 1.While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.Revelations over the past month about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda have prompted questions from both political parties about whether more federal oversight of their businesses is needed.Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require Internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms."
1342,"Helicopter pilot Pete Gavitte peered through his night vision goggles late Sunday as he approached a fast-growing wildfire near the California wine country town of Napa and instantly knew there was trouble ahead. “We saw that it was actually really large, looked like a nuke had gone off or something,” said Gavitte, an 18-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol.As sirens blared from his helicopter, residents were grabbing their belongings and jumping into their cars to head down Atlas Peak Road, the only way out of the rural community.But unbeknownst to those on the ground, flames would soon engulf the road, with downed trees and power poles blocking any exit. Over the next few days, the raging fires would kill at least 21 people and destroy 3,500 homes and businesses. Strong, dry winds are expected to fan new outbreaks in coming days.“We could see pretty well this huge, three-mile and growing line of fire coming toward all these folks that probably couldn’t see it,” Gavitte said. He shined his searchlight on drivers to get their attention and prompt them to stop.Gavitte, 49, and his first officer and paramedic Whitney Lowe soon landed near a vineyard to begin what would become an extraordinary seven-hour rescue operation, conducted through the night by two helicopters in winds gusting up to 70 miles an hour (113 km per hour).Lowe ran down a hill from the helicopter to begin corralling people, while Gavitte stayed at the helm. Those ultimately rescued ranged from a child to a 94-year-old woman that Lowe carried from car to helicopter, according to Lowe and Shaun Bouyea, a CHP air operations public information officer.Some of those saved had just left their homes, while others were working in the area’s vineyards. Some were driving straight for the flames. Many at first resisted boarding the choppers and leaving everything behind, but were soon persuaded.Within hours, the area known as Atlas was in flames, with homes and vineyards incinerated. But 42 people, five dogs and a cat were saved in the aerial rescue.Bouyea said the helicopters made about 20 trips, which became slower and bumpier as conditions deteriorated. In one case, a husband parted with his son, wife and her parents when there was no room left on board, Lowe said. The helicopter saved the man on another trip.“I’d tell them, ‘sit down, sit on the floor, it’s going to be bumpy,'” Gavitte said.There was little talk otherwise.Gavitte had to throw the belongings of the wife off the aircraft despite her insistence, because space and safety would not allow it.“The conditions Sunday night were out of the ordinary,” Gavitte said. “The gusts were pretty bad. That kind of tossed the helicopter around a lot.”Atlas, an unincorporated area in Napa County, was among the most devastated. A 30-minute drive from the posh shops of the wine country capital, the area is rural, lacks cell phone service and houses many who are elderly.“I‘m almost 70, and I was the youngster,” said Ritchie Sumner, who used to live in the community. His sister’s house burned down in the fire while she was safe in another town, he said.Even in the extreme conditions Sunday night, there were some Gavitte encountered who refused to be rescued. They said they had their own escape plans. Though it is possible the second helicopter evacuated them, Gavitte never learned their fate.On Monday, Gavitte finally headed home for sleep.“I woke up and took a Tylenol and had a bowl of comfort ice cream,” he said. “It was pretty stressful.”"
1343,"The death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has risen to 44 three weeks after the storm ripped through the island, Governor Ricardo Rossello said Wednesday.In a statement in which he also asked Congress for more financial assistance, Rossello updated the toll released on Tuesday after another person died due to a fractured skull.""There are also four deaths confirmed to be related to leptospirosis,"" he added, referring to a rare bacterial disease contracted through the urine of infected animals.With over 5,700 people living in shelters and most of the island still without electricity and running water, the risk posed by contagious diseases is amplified because the landscape and infrastructure remains severely damaged following the Category Four storm.As a result, Rossello added that he has asked President Trump for an additional $4.9 billion under the Community Disaster Loan program.""This program will allow the island the funds it needs to meet operational and payroll expenses,"" the governor wrote.Last Wednesday, Trump asked Congress to approve an emergency aid package of $29 billion for Puerto Rico.The latest request adds to ""billions we expect to receive for other aid we have requested,"" Rossello said.The governor's office did not respond to queries about the total amount of aid requested, which is now equivalent to around half of Puerto Rico's debt of some $73 billion.Maria devastated the island amid a severe financial crisis, with the government filing for bankruptcy in May.The crisis has caused 10 percent of the population to leave since 2006, with unemployment reaching 12 percent and poverty 46 percent.Figures of the latest exodus are unknown, but it is believed Maria's destruction has prompted thousands of Puerto Ricans to leave for the US mainland, with most heading for Florida."
1344,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied a report from NBC News that he told his national security advisers in July he wanted to increase the country’s nuclear arsenal by nearly tenfold, saying he argued for its modernization.NBC News said the president called for the increase after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of US nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.Speaking to reporters at the White House during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump said the report was not true.“I never discussed increasing it. I want it in perfect shape. That was just fake news by NBC,” he said. “We don’t need an increase. But I want modernization and I want total rehabilitation. It’s got to be in tip-top shape.”The president’s denial was buttressed by a statement from his defence chief.“Recent reports that the president called for an increase in the US nuclear arsenal are absolutely false. This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said.Although US presidents have modernized weapon stockpiles over the years, any meaningful addition to the nuclear arsenal would violate treaty agreements.The Federation of American Scientists says the United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile.After the meeting in July, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. US news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.The NBC report comes during a time of high tension between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, and just ahead of an expected announcement from Trump on whether to decertify the international deal on Iran’s nuclear program.Trump told Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the US nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack”.MSNBC reported in 2016 that as a candidate, Trump asked a foreign policy adviser three times in a one-hour meeting why the United States could not deploy its nuclear weapons."
1345,"WASHINGTON: A senior US Treasury official on Wednesday criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its views on the Trump administration’s tax proposals and said the institution should keep out of the US fiscal policy debate.The IMF has deleted its earlier forecasts of a growth boost from Trump’s tax cut and reform plans, which have been slow to materialize.Fund officials also have disputed the Trump administration’s views that these plans could boost growth consistently to the 3 percent or higher level that the administration has targeted and have said the plans should not increase US deficits.The Fund also released a report on Wednesday saying that progressive tax systems are better for fighting inequality and growth, with higher rates on wealthier individuals.“The IMF, I think, has other things to do in the world than interject itself into the US tax debate,” the Treasury official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said that Trump’s tax program was a work in progress but would boost growth and median incomes, adding: “The IMF is not really the ones that ought to be rating the odds for this.”The United States is the IMF’s largest shareholder with a 16.5 percent share of the institution’s board votes, giving it an effective veto over decisions.The official also defended the Trump administration’s stance on globalization and international cooperation, saying it was not retreating from such engagement.The official said the administration is trying to get foreign governments ”to think about being modest in their view of their own role within the way the world economy works.“One of the things that we want to push against, we need to push against is the tendency of the governments to run the economies, run the people of the world, so that’s a priority.”"
1346,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump will nominate Kirstjen Nielsen — who, as the top aide to his White House chief of staff, has sought to instil order in Trump’s team — to lead the US Department of Homeland Security, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.If confirmed by the Senate, Nielsen would take the reins at a sprawling department with more than 240,000 employees that is responsible for US border and airport security, immigration policy, disaster response, refugee admissions, and other matters.Nielsen, 45, is a cybersecurity expert with a considerable resume in homeland security that includes work at the department’s Transportation Security Administration and on former Republican President George W. Bush’s White House Homeland Security Council.Nielsen was retired Marine Corps General John Kelly’s chief of staff when he was secretary of homeland security during the opening months of Trump’s presidency.Kelly brought her to the White House as his deputy when Trump named him chief of staff in July to replace Reince Priebus after only six months on the job.The nomination requires Senate confirmation.Nielsen’s departure from the White House would mark the latest upheaval in Trump’s White House team. She was responsible for carrying out some of Kelly’s orders on who gets access to the president.As a result, she has irritated some White House officials who now have limited contact with Trump, according to sources familiar with the situation.Kelly has sought to bring more order to the chaotic West Wing since replacing Priebus. Trump has welcomed the changes to some extent, although he has privately confided to friends that the limitations on access to the Oval Office sometimes go too far.Putting Nielsen into the Homeland Security post will allow Trump and Kelly to keep a close eye on the department, but getting her out of the White House could permit some of Kelly’s strictness to be relaxed.The department has been led by Elaine Duke — an acting secretary — since Kelly took the White House post.Cybersecurity is one of the primary issues under the Homeland Security Department’s portfolio.Nielsen previously worked at a cyber think tank at George Washington University — blocks away from the White House — and is considered well-versed in some of the more technical missions at the department, such as sharing cyber-threat information with the private sector.The department was created after the 9/11 attacks on the United States exposed cracks in the country’s homeland security apparatus.The appointment comes at a busy time for the department, with the Federal Emergency Management Agency — one of its agencies — overseeing disaster relief in hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, Texas, and Florida as well as wildfire-ravaged areas of California.The department also is responsible for US border security.The department is a major player in implementing Trump’s aggressive stance toward deporting illegal immigrants, as well as vetting the lower number of refugees Trump has decided to allow into the United States and devising his travel ban on six Muslim-majority nations, North Korea, and certain Venezuelans.“It seems like a low-drama pick. It’s a little concerning that she seems to have little background in immigration security and policy, but those individual agencies are in good hands already, and there is a strong core of career managers,” Jessica Vaughan — the director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors more limits on immigration — said.Nielsen is not known for hard-line views on immigration like those of White House adviser Stephen Miller.If confirmed, Nielsen would be the first homeland security secretary to have previously served as a rank-and-file member of the department. Some previous DHS secretaries have been criticized for not possessing enough technical fluency to address cyber threats facing the nation.“Kirstjen’s a policy wonk at heart, especially when it comes to cyber,” Frank Cilluffo — a former senior homeland security official under Bush who worked with Nielsen at George Washington University — said.Nielsen would immediately be given the task of helping coordinate the federal response to potential cyber attacks that target elections.US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election to try to help Trump win, in part by hacking and releasing emails embarrassing to Hillary Clinton — his Democratic opponent — and through online propaganda.Russia has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Moscow.Jeh Johnson — who served as former Democratic President Barack Obama’s last homeland secretary chief — designated election systems as critical infrastructure, widening the support the department can provide to states. But the department has clashed with several state officials over how best to cooperate to defend future elections.Politico first reported the appointment."
1347,"Manchester United will approach Saturday’s high-profile Premier League meeting with bitter rivals Liverpool as they would any other match, manager Jose Mourinho has said.United have made a strong start to the season and are second in the table behind Manchester City on goal difference. They have scored 21 goals and let in only two to sit on 19 points.Ahead of a tricky test against seventh-placed Liverpool, who have struggled to plug leaks in defence but have shown plenty of attacking intent, Mourinho played down the importance of the clash at this stage in the season.“When you are in a big club, when you are a big player, when you are a big manager, every game is important,” Mourinho was quoted by the club website on Wednesday as saying in TV interviews with British media.“You cannot look at some matches as cup finals and other matches differently. For me, every match is a cup final and I’ve been like this all the time,” he added.”It’s three points not four. If we are at a moment in a season where the duel between the two teams ensures the result will mean more than three points, then yes.“Sometimes a draw or even to lose by a certain goal difference is important. In this case, it is not important. It’s just a three-point match. That’s the way I approach it.”Mourinho has a good record against Liverpool and won his first trophy in English football by beating the Merseyside club to win the League Cup with Chelsea in 2005.He has suffered some painful lows, however, against the Anfield outfit including Champions League semi-final defeats in 2005 and 2007.The Portuguese said he was happy to travel to Anfield without any added pressure or emotion and looked forward to the clash.“Do I like to go to Anfield? Yes, I love it. Do I like to play against Liverpool? Yes. I like amazing stadiums, the best opponents but the preparation is not different,” he said.United will be without midfielder Marouane Fellaini who injured his knee while playing for Belgium, while Liverpool will miss the services of Sadio Mane, who is out for up to six weeks with a hamstring injury he picked up on international duty."
1348,"WASHINGTON: The US budget deficit is proving to be a major obstacle to the tax reform plan being offered by President Donald Trump and top congressional Republicans, with one leading Senate hawk saying a week after the plan was introduced that any enlarging of the fiscal gap could kill his support.From proposed infrastructure enhancements to a military build-up, the deficit long ago put the brakes on major new federal spending programs; now Trump’s tax-cut proposal is threatened.“It looks to me like the administration’s already running for the hills. It looks to me like some of the tax-writing chairmen are already running for the hills ... I’m disheartened by the lack of intestinal fortitude I’m seeing,” Sen. Bob Corker said.The main problem is that the federal government is swimming in red ink with an annual deficit of $550 billion and a national debt -- the accumulation of past deficits and interest due to lenders to the U.S. Treasury -- exceeding $20 trillion.The Republican tax plan unveiled last week calls for as much as $6 trillion in tax cuts that would sharply reduce federal revenues. No commensurate spending cuts have been proposed. So, on their own, the tax cuts being sought by Trump would hugely expand the deficit and add to the debt.The administration has said two things must happen for the revenue losses to be offset. One is for economic growth to generate new tax revenues. Forecasts for that vary, with Republicans projecting much stronger economic growth and unusually large revenue gains resulting from tax cuts.“While policymakers are gearing up to address tax reform this fall, some have advocated for abandoning true reform and instead focusing solely on tax cuts. To combat arguments that such cuts will balloon the national debt, tax cut advocates have argued that the cuts could pay for themselves, largely through faster economic growth,” said the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a Washington balanced-budget advocacy group.“However, this claim is false,” the group said in a statement.The other way to prevent expanding the deficit is for the U.S. Congress to find new revenues for the government by closing certain tax breaks to offset Trump’s proposed deep tax cuts for corporations, small businesses and wealthy Americans.At least $4 trillion in new revenue needs to be raised this way, said lawmakers, but every tax break on the federal books has a special interest protecting it and that is a challenge.For example, Republicans proposed ending or limiting the individual tax deduction for state and local income taxes paid. Closing the tax break would bring in $1.3 trillion in revenues.But high-tax states would be hit harder than low-tax states by such a move. Lawmakers in New York and California, which have among the highest state tax levels in the country, were resisting the proposal to repeal the deduction, eroding support for the plan, even among Republicans, said lawmakers and aides.Corker has vowed that he will not support a tax plan that adds to the federal deficit. As a result, he is firm about what needs to be done to win his support for tax cuts.“There’s no way to do permanent tax reform, no way, without … loophole closing,” said the Tennessee Republican, who announced recently that he will not run for reelection in November 2018.Analysts said the $20 trillion national debt is already on an unsustainable upward path as the government pays for the medical and retirement costs of the aging Baby Boom generation.That would worsen if rising government debt undermined future economic growth by pushing interest rates higher and choking off private sector access to credit, they said.An administration official said the White House is inclined to let Congress lead on the state and local tax deduction.House and Senate Republicans need to agree on a budget resolution if they intend to pass a tax bill before January and without broad bipartisan support from Democrats. The House was set to vote on its version of a budget resolution on Thursday."

He also worked as deputy managing director at Aramco Asia Korea, according to his LinkedIn profile.Major oil producers that have lost market share due to the rise in U.S. shale oil production are tapping rising fuel demand in Asia.Earlier this year Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investment in projects in Indonesia and Malaysia to ensure long-term oil supply deals.The Kingdom wants to mirror that strategy in India, after missing out to Russia’s Rosneft in an opportunity to buy a majority stake in private refiner Essar.Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has said that India was a prime target as Aramco looked for collaboration opportunities across Asia.The International Energy Agency estimates India’s refining capacity will lag fuel demand going forward, requiring investment in new plants.Aramco representatives have met officials of provincial governments including West Bengal and southern Andhra Pradesh to scout for investment opportunities, sources said.Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said earlier this year that Aramco wants to have exclusive talks for a stake in a planned 1.2 million barrel per day refinery on India’s west coast."

1351,"BANGKOK: Almost 12 million people, or almost one sixth of Thailand’s population, have visited the glittering Grand Palace in Bangkok to pay their respects to the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej since he died last October, the palace said on Thursday.Thousands lined the streets of Bangkok’s historic area near the Chao Phraya River to enter the palace on Thursday, the last day to see the late king before the royal cremation on Oct. 26.Queues stretched for more than two km (1.2 miles), officials said, with many lining up since Wednesday.“I’ve been here since 6 pm and I managed to pay respects at 7 am,” Tossapon Thongmak, 33, a Bangkok resident.“We were rained on last night but this is a must - we must pay our respects to father,” he said.King Bhumibol died last October aged 88 and his body has laid in state in a gold hall at the palace.He was widely seen as a father figure and regarded as the nation’s moral compass during decades of on-off political turbulence including several coups, bloody street protests and a region-wide 1997/98 financial crisis.He was succeeded in December by his only son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, known as Rama X, who has since overseen a shake-up at the palace to give himself greater authority.The royal funeral will be a mix of Buddhist religious ceremonies and Hindu Brahmin rituals.“This is the first time that many Thais will experience a royal funeral for a monarch. So the grandeur, the beauty, and the determination of everyone involved in the preparation is a new experience for all,” Tonthong Chandransu, a public relations official for the funeral organization committee and an expert on the Thai monarchy, told Reuters in an interview.“From the architecture, the craftsmanship, the various preparations and their fine details, I have never seen this sort of dedication.”Builders have been working for months on a royal crematorium that was built from scratch on a green in front of the palace.“Time was needed in order to build heaven, based on imagination and belief systems that fused Buddhism with Brahmin Hindu traditions that are important in Thai society,” Tonthong said.The palace has said it expects 250,000 mourners to attend the royal cremation.Thailand’s tourism body has asked tourists to respect Thai sensitivities during what promises to be an emotionally-charged time."

Those forces were not patrolling the area with any specific objective, such as a high-value target or rescuing a hostage, the official added.A spokesman for US Africa Command confirmed the attack after Radio France International (RFI) reported a lethal ambush near the Niger/Mali border.“We can confirm reports that a joint US and Nigerien patrol came under hostile fire in southwest Niger,” said the spokesman.Namatta Abubacar, an official for the region of Tillaberi in Niger, said five Nigerien soldiers were among the dead.A Niger diplomatic source said the attackers had come from Mali and had killed several soldiers, without saying whether any of the US troops stationed in the West African country were among the victims.US President Donald Trump was briefed by telephone on the attack by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly while Trump flew back on Air Force One from Las Vegas, where he had been visiting victims and first responders affected by Sunday’s mass shooting.RFI said earlier on Wednesday a counter-attack was underway.African security forces backed by Western troops are stepping up efforts to counter jihadist groups forming part of a growing regional insurgency in the poor, sparsely populated deserts of the Sahel.A relatively new militant group called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara has claimed some of the attacks.Geoff D Porter, head of North Africa Risk Consulting, said that any confirmation of Daesh's role in Wednesday’s strike would lead to a strategic shift from Libya toward the Sahel band, stretching eastwards from Senegal to Chad.“The emphasis ... will now shift south,” he said.The US Africa Command has hundreds of soldiers deployed across the region, including at an air facility in Agadez, and offers training and support to Niger’s army in aspects such as intelligence gathering and surveillance."

1359,"LONDON: Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been stripped of a human rights award by the City of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate, as British institutions increasingly distance themselves from the beleaguered former rights icon.Oxford City Council voted unanimously this week to recommend Suu Kyi’s Freedom of the City award be withdrawn, citing deep concerns over the treatment of Rohingya Muslims under her watch.The city’s reputation is “tarnished by honoring those who turn a blind eye to violence,” local councilor and Labour party member Mary Clarkson said in a speech proposing the motion.Over 500,000 members of Myanmar’s Rohingya minority have fled across the border to Bangladesh since late August, when Rohingya attacks led to a violent crackdown by the army.Myanmar’s de facto leader Suu Kyi, previously renowned for her human rights activism, has been widely criticized for her silence on the subject.“While the UN calls the situation a ‘textbook example of ethnic cleansing’, Aung San Suu Kyi denies any ethnic cleansing and dismisses numerous claims of sexual violence against Rohingya women as ‘fake rape,'” Clarkson said.In a speech in late September, her first public statement on the subject since the exodus of refugees began, Suu Kyi said her government condemned all human rights violations and promised to punish perpetrators.But she did not address accusations of ethnic cleansing and did not criticize the army’s actions. Her speech was described as “little more than a mix of untruths and victim-blaming” by Amnesty International director for the region, James Gomez.The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar has seen more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims flee to neighbouring BangladeshA similar Freedom of the City award is being considered for withdrawal by Sheffield city council in the north of England, after residents submitted a petition last month.The award will likely be reviewed by councillors this month, the council’s democratic services team, which handles petitions, told Reuters.Oxford University college St Hugh‘s, Suu Kyi’s alma mater, removed her portrait last week from public display while Unison, Britain’s second-largest trade union, announced last month it would suspend her honorary membership."

1375,"LONDON: An accountability court has asked Pakistan High Commission (PHC) to serve bailable arrest warrants to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s children and his son-in-law Captain Safdar at the Avenfield apartments, but none other than Hasan Nawaz lives at the mentioned address making it impossible for the summons to be served in the correct manner.Maryam Nawaz, Hussain Nawaz, Asma Nawaz and Captain Safdar are living at a separate location and are not at the Avenfield apartments. Nawaz Sharif stays with Hasan when in London while others in the family visit Avenfield block regularly and its believed that the whole family stays at this address. Hence, the accountability court sent summons to this address. It has created problems for the PHC which can present the summons for Hasan Nawaz to his porter who manages the reception of Avenfield block but PHC officials have no clue where Maryam, Hussain and others are currently staying.It can be confirmed that out of the four apartments mentioned in the Panama Papers, only Hasan Nawaz’s flat is suitable for accommodation while the other three flats are undergoing maintenance work and are not suitable for lodging. A source said that Hussain, Maryam and Safdar have been staying at rented accommodation nearby to be close to Kulsoom Nawaz..There is not enough space in Hasan Nawaz’s four bedroom apartment to accommodate his siblings and relatives, hence two flats have been rented nearby to accommodate family and relatives. Begum Kulsoom Nawaz has been staying with Hasan since she reached London for treatment and is attended by a doctor and an assistant round the clock while staying at this address.A source confirmed that bailable arrest warrants for Hassan, Hussain, Maryam and Safdar were sent through “fax and parcel” three days ago and officials of PHC have confirmed the “receipt” to the Foreign Office of Pakistan.The source said two copies of the warrants for each accused had been received at the high commission. The source said that the high commission delivered the summons and legal notices at Avenfield apartments during the Panama case hearings and the same method was used by Wajid Zia’s cousin Akhtar Raja who sent letters to Hasan and Hussain Nawaz on the same address. A PHC spokesman refused to comment when asked if the arrest warrants have been served to the concerned individuals or not.Nawaz Sharif appeared before the NAB court on Wednesday but Geo News had reported on Saturday, prior to Nawaz Sharif’s departure, that his children will not become part of the accountability proceedings while Nawaz Sharif will seek an exemption from his appearance.The NAB court has announced to indict the ex-premier on October 2 in cases pertaining to Avenfiled apartments and Azizia Steel Mills against the Sharif family. The accountability court in Islamabad on Tuesday summoned Maryam Nawaz, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Nawaz and Captain (R) Mohammad Safdar to appear before the court on October 2 but it’s understood that none will appear before the NAB court because the Sharif family and its supporters say that Nawaz Sharif is being victimised and that he failed to get fair trial at the Supreme Court."

1378,"ARBIL: The Iraqi government cut autonomous Kurdistan’s direct air links with the outside world indefinitely on Friday, partially isolating the northern region after it voted a massive ""yes"" in an independence referendum.The move increases the pressure on the Iraqi Kurds amid soaring regional tensions following Monday’s non-binding but deeply contentious vote.The central government in Baghdad had ordered the halt to all foreign flights to and from the region from 6pm (1500 GMT).Foreigners scrambled to fly out of Iraqi Kurdistan from the region’s capital, Arbil, and its second largest city Sulaimaniyah before the ban took effect.The Iraqi Kurdish transport minister, Mawlud Bawa Murad, told AFP at Arbil airport that the flight ban would ""negatively impact all international businesses in the Kurdistan region, in addition to all civilians, from all nations"".It would ""negatively impact our daily life,"" he said. ""We will do our best to find a viable alternative, or succeed to bring back international flights.""Arbil airport is a key gateway for humanitarian aid workers helping Iraqis affected by the battle against the Daesh group.Washington has said it would be willing to facilitate talks between the Iraqi Kurdish authorities and Baghdad to calm escalating tensions over the 92% ""yes"" vote, as a top Shiite cleric called for the crisis to be solved in an Iraqi court.Neighbouring Turkey and Iran also strongly opposed the vote, fearing it would inflame the separatist aspirations of their own sizeable Kurdish populations.Ankara has threatened a series of measures, including blocking lifeline oil exports from the region via Turkey.The Kurds, whose borders with Turkey, Iran and Syria remain open, have condemned the flight suspension as ""collective punishment"".Iraq’s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said it was not ""punishment"" but a legal measure that would be reversed if the transport authority was transferred to Baghdad in line with the Iraqi constitution.The ban saw people, many of them foreigners, flock to the airport in Arbil to avoid being stranded.Iraqi Kurdistan is home to a large international community, most of whom enter on a visa issued by the regional authorities that is not recognised by the central government, so they cannot travel elsewhere in Iraq.On Friday, around 100 passengers waited eagerly for their planes in Arbil, where the last flight out was to Vienna at 4pm.""We were supposed to go back to Brazil next Saturday but we rescheduled our flight,"" said Isidoro Junior, a 32-year-old volunteer for an NGO providing medical assistance to Iraqis displaced by the war against Daesh.""We are a group of 16 people, so it was quite difficult to find enough seats. One of us came here at 2am to make sure...we would be able to fly out,"" he said.At the Turkish Airlines counter, before the last flight left, a one-way ticket to Istanbul cost $743. But it sold for $1,500 online, said one passenger who had paid twice in error, leaving a £3,000 dent in his credit card.The director of Arbil airport, Talar Faiq Salih, said humanitarian, military and diplomatic flights were excluded from the ban.Earlier, the UN humanitarian office OCHA said it was working to ensure aid could continue to reach tens of thousands of needy Iraqis.In Sulaimaniyah, foreigners and others needing to leave sped to the airport before the ban took effect, while Kurds who were abroad for business or tourism rushed home.""There have been masses of people for two days,"" said airport spokesperson Dana Mohammad Said, adding that the airport remained open for domestic flights.An Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad took off from Arbil at 7pm, an AFP correspondent said."

1380,"WASHINGTON: The head of the US Air Force Academy has delivered an unequivocal rebuke to bigots after the discovery of racist graffiti on campus, telling them, ""You need to get out.""""If you're outraged by those words, then you're in the right place,"" Lieutenant General Jay Silveria said in an address to cadets, faculty, and staff at the academy in Colorado Springs, footage of which has since gone viral.""You should be outraged not only as an airman but as a human being,"" the academy's superintendent said.—Check out Lieutenant General Jay Silveria's comments in the video clip at the end of this storyFive African-American students at the Academy's Preparatory School found racist comments on dormitory message boards earlier this week.One posted an image on Facebook showing a whiteboard with ""Go home, nigger"" written on it, and parents then alerted faculty.""That kind of behaviour has no place at the Prep School, has no place at USAFA (US Air Force Academy), and it has no place in the United States Air Force,"" Silveria said.""If you can't treat someone from another race or different colour skin with dignity and respect, then you need to get out,"" he said.At the close of his remarks, the general invited those gathered to take out their phones and record his message.If ""you need my words, then you keep these words, and you use them and you remember them and you share them and you talk about them: If you can't treat someone with dignity and respect, then get out.""Back on August 17 — when he assumed leadership of the Academy — Silveria said one of his three goals was boosting a culture of respect and dignity.“If you want to find a red line with me, it will be in the area of respect and dignity,” he said, according to a press release on the USAFA website, adding that “what you do is so critical and I’ve known what you do for decades.”US Senator John McCain — a former naval officer who was held captive in Vietnam — tweeted a video of Silveria's remarks, saying that it was an ""important statement.""""I agree, there's no place for racism or bigotry in our military or this great nation,"" McCain said.The graffiti — and Silveria's reply — come at a time of heightened focus on racism in the United States, a context he noted in his speech.""We would… be tone-deaf not to think about the backdrop of what's going on in our country, things like Charlottesville and Ferguson, the protests in the NFL,"" he said.In mid-August, top military officers offered strong condemnation of racism after a violent neo-Nazi and white supremacist rally over the removal of a Confederate statue in Charlottesville, Virginia.One woman was killed — when an avowed white supremacist ploughed his car into a crowd of people after the Charlottesville rally turned violent — and numerous demonstrators were injured during the events of August 11 and 12.The response of senior officers was in contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who suggested there was blame ""on both sides,"" and that there were ""very fine people"" among the white supremacist protesters — remarks that were widely criticized.There have been heightened calls for the removal of other Confederate statues in the wake of the violence.Ferguson is a suburb of St Louis that became the focus of national attention following the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown, which sparked demonstrations and a heavy-handed police response.Protesters have recently taken to the streets in St Louis amid outrage over the acquittal of a white former police officer in the shooting death of a black man.And NFL players are protesting against racism by kneeling during the national anthem before games — protests that have drawn repeated criticism from Trump."
1381,"MADRID: Spain threatened on Wednesday to suspend Catalonia´s autonomy if it follows through on its threat to break away as an independent country.Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has vowed to do everything in his power to prevent Catalan secession following a banned referendum in the region, which remains deeply divided over independence.He held an emergency cabinet meeting after Catalonia´s president Carles Puigdemont announced on Tuesday that he had accepted the mandate for ""Catalonia to become an independent state.""Rajoy asked the Catalan leader to clarify whether he had actually declared independence, which could trigger moves by Madrid to suspend the region´s semi-autonomous status.The Catalan crisis is Spain´s most serious political emergency since its return to democracy four decades ago.World leaders are watching closely and uncertainty over the fate of the region of 7.5 million people has damaged business confidence.Puigdemont said the referendum had given him a mandate for independence but immediately asked regional lawmakers to suspend the declaration to allow for negotiations with the central government.""The cabinet agreed this morning to formally ask the Catalan government to confirm whether it declared independence,"" he said in a televised address after emergency cabinet talks.""The answer from the Catalan president will determine future events, in the next few days,"" Rajoy said.""The government wants to offer certainty to Spaniards, especially Catalans. It wants to avoid the confusion that has been generated by Catalan authorities.""Rajoy could choose to trigger constitution article 155, which allows Madrid to impose control over its devolved regions -- a move many fear could lead to unrest.The leader of the opposition Socialist Party, Pedro Sanchez, said meanwhile that his side and the government had agreed to study a possible constitutional reform"" to try to end the crisis.The debate would focus on ""how Catalonia remains in Spain, and not how it leaves,"" Sanchez told reporters.While separatist leaders say 90 percent of voters opted to split from Spain in the October plebiscite, less than half of the region´s eligible voters actually turned out.The drive to break Catalonia away from Spain has raised concern for stability in a European Union still coming to terms with Britain´s shock decision to leave the bloc.The EU on Wednesday urged ""full respect of the Spanish constitutional order,"" with European Commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis saying the bloc was following developments ""closely"".Crowds of thousands gathered outside the parliament building in Barcelona on Tuesday ahead of Puigdemont´s speech, waving Catalan flags and banners and screaming ""democracy"" in the hope of witnessing history in the making.But Spain´s political establishment rounded on Puigdemont following his declaration, and support among separatists in Catalonia was mixed.Barcelona resident Maria Rosa Bertran said she was against a delayed secession, which meant ""suffering a longer agony. Indecision and uncertainty is the worst thing that can happen to us,"" she told AFP.The government stuck to its stance that it would not accept mediation or any talks until Catalan leaders drop their independence bid.""Neither Mr Puigdemont, nor anyone, can expect to impose mediation without returning to legality or democracy,"" Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria told reporters on Tuesday.She said Puigdemont was ""a person who doesn´t know where he is, where he´s going or with whom he wants to go"".Following his declaration to parliament, Puigdemont and his allies signed an independence declaration outside the chamber, but its legal validity was unclear.Regional government spokesman Jordi Turull said the declaration was ""a symbolic act"", adding that any official decision would need to be decided by the Catalan parliament.Madrid has consistently said independence is not up for discussion.""I did not expect independence to be declared today because of all the processes that the government of Spain has begun, both with police actions and with threats,"" Marc Cazes, a student in Barcelona, said on Tuesday.Police violence against voters during the referenudm vote sparked international concern.The crisis has caused deep uncertainty for businesses in one of the wealthiest regions in the eurozone´s fourth-largest economy.A string of companies have already moved their legal headquarters -- but not their employees -- from Catalonia to other parts of the country.The Spanish stock market was up 1.4 percent by midday on hopes for a breakthrough in the crisis.Demands for independence in Catalonia, one of Spain´s 17 semi-autonomous regions which has its own language and cultural traditions, date back centuries.But a 2010 move by Spain´s Constitutional Court to water down a statute that gave Catalonia additional powers, combined with a deep economic meltdown in Spain, sparked a surge in support for independence."
1382,"NEW YORK: Oil prices closed up on Friday after a rally in prices on geopolitical instability in Iraqi Kurdistan helped Brent make its strongest third-quarter price performance since 2004.Global benchmark Brent crude closed up 13 cents (or 0.2 percent) to $57.54 a barrel, notching up a third-quarter gain of around 20 percent. On the week, Brent was up 1.2 percent.The contract reached its highest in more than two years earlier in the week, resulting in a fifth consecutive weekly gain. This was Brent's longest weekly bull run since June 2016.US crude closed up 11 cents to settle at $51.67 a barrel, its strongest third quarter in 10 years and the longest streak of weekly gains since January. US crude was up around 2 percent on the week.“The bigger concern for oil is the Kurdish region,” Matt Smith — the director of Commodity Research at ClipperData — said.“Today we’re seeing international flights banned, the trucking of fuels being banned from Iran,” he added.Iraq’s Kurds endorsed secession by nine to one in a referendum on Monday that has angered Turkey, the central government in Baghdad and other powers, which fear the vote could lead to renewed conflict in the oil-rich region.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called the vote illegitimate and has threatened to break with past practice and deal only with the Baghdad government over oil exports from Iraq.Oil price gains have also been supported by anticipated demand from US refiners resuming operations after shutdowns due to Hurricane Harvey.But oil output from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has risen this month by 50,000 barrels per day (BPD) — according to Reuters survey — as Iraqi exports increased and production edged higher in Libya, one of the producers exempt from a supply-cutting deal.Middle Eastern oil producers are concerned the recent price rise will incentivize US shale production and push prices lower again.US energy companies added oil rigs for the first week in seven after a 14-month drilling recovery stalled in August, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.Drillers added six oil rigs in the week to September 29, bringing the total count up to 750.Money managers raised their net long US crude futures and options positions in the week to September 26, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Friday.The speculator group raise its futures and options position in New York and London by 55,623 contracts to 285,555."

1386,"PARIS: The clownfish, the colourful swimmer propelled to fame by the 2003 film ""Finding Nemo"", is under threat from warming ocean waters wreaking havoc with sea anemones -- the structures which serve as its home, a study has found.Closely related to corals, sea anemones are invertebrate marine creatures that live in symbiosis with algae, which provide them with food, oxygen and colour.Clownfish, also known as anemonefish, in turn use the structures as shelter to lay their eggs and raise their young -- keeping the anemones clean in return.For the study, published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, a research team monitored 13 pairs of orange-fin anemonefish living among the coral reefs of Moorea Island in the South Pacific.They were monitored before, during and after the El Nino weather event that in 2016 caused major coral bleaching as the Pacific Ocean warmed.Half of the anemones in the study ""bleached"", expelling the algae that live on them and turning bone white, the team found.This happens in response to environmental stress, such as ocean warming or pollution.""Among the clownfish living in the bleached anemones, the scientists observed a drastic fall (-73 percent) in the number of viable eggs,"" said a statement from France´s CNRS research institute.""These fish were laying eggs less frequently and they were also laying fewer and less-viable eggs.""No changes were observed among fish with unbleached abodes.Blood samples showed a sharp increase in levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the affected fish, and a ""significant drop"" in sex hormones that determine fertility, the team reported.The health of the anemones and the fish improved three to four months after the end of the warming event.Further research is needed, the team said, to examine the effects of a longer, or more intense, warming period, and whether affected fish would deal better or worse with a new bleaching episode.Exceptional ocean warming events are predicted to become more frequent as the average global temperature rises.Nearly 200 nations agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit warming to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) over industrial levels.A level of about 1 C has already been reached and scientists fear the ceiling will be shattered, with potentially disastrous consequences for the Earth´s climate.In June last year, a study said many of the real-life Nemos swimming in children´s fish tanks around the world were caught using cyanide -- another threat to the species.""Finding Nemo"", the movie about the quest of a young fish separated from its family, resulted in more than a million clownfish being harvested from tropical reefs as pets."
1387,"DAMASCUS: Three suicide bombers blew themselves up near the main police headquarters building in Syria's capital Damascus on Wednesday, killing at least two people, the interior ministry said.The attack is the second time in a month that suicide attackers have targeted the capital, which has often been insulated from the worst of the violence in the war-torn country.Two of the suicide bombers detonated their explosives in front of the police HQ on Khaled Bin al-Walid street in central Damascus, the interior ministry said in a statement carried by state media.""The terrorist suicide attackers tried to storm the police command headquarters... The guards opened fire on them, forcing them to blow themselves up before they entered the building and achieved their goals,"" it added.Police surrounded a third attacker behind the building who also blew himself up, the statement said.The interior ministry said two people had been killed and six wounded in the attack, among them two children.Damascus police chief Mohammed Khairu Ismail told reporters at the scene of the attack that one of the dead was a policeman who tried to stop the bombers.""One of our forces grabbed one of the suicide bombers and prevented him from entering the building, so he blew himself up, killing the sergeant,"" Ismail said.It was the second time this month that suicide attackers have targeted police in the capital, after at least 17 people were killed in an October 2 attack on a police station in the southern district of Midan.That attack was claimed by Daesh, which said three of its fighters armed with guns, grenades and explosives had targeted the station.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Wednesday's attack in the central neighbourhood of Qanawat.More than 330,000 people have been killed in Syria since the country's conflict began in March 2011, with anti-government protests.Damascus has been shaken by several bomb attacks, despite being largely spared from the worst of the violence in the six-year war.In this month's incident at Midan, one attacker was able to reach the first floor of the police station before blowing himself up.The Midan police station itself had previously been targeted in December 2016, when a seven-year-old girl entered the building wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated.Rebel groups have been gradually expelled from territory in the capital they once held, though they maintain a presence in a handful of positions, including the Jobar neighbourhood.They also hold territory in the Eastern Ghouta region outside the capital and have regularly launched rockets into the city.A deal worked out between regime allies Russia and Iran with rebel backer Turkey earlier this year has implemented so-called ""de-escalation zones"" in several parts of the country, including Eastern Ghouta, bringing a measure of relative calm.But the fight against Daesh is continuing, with government troops and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a coalition of Kurdish and Arab fighters, leading separate offensives against the terrorists in the north and east Syria."
1388,"DHAKA: It was a match between Pakistan versus hosts Bangladesh which enthralled the local audience on the opening day of the Hero Asia Cup here at the Maulana Bhashani National Stadium on Wednesday. Abu Mahmood was the hero of the match with three scintillating goals in the 18th, 41st and 50th minute which helped Pakistan seal their opening match of the tournament.It was Pakistan who were quick to get off the block and put the hosts on a back foot when they won a penalty corner in the first quarter of the match. But it was well defended by the Bangladeshi goalkeeper Asim Gope.The second quarter saw Pakistan win another penalty corner in the 17th minute, but a poorly executed variation saw Bangladeshi defenders push the ball away. Pakistan won yet another penalty corner almost immediately and this time Abu Mahmood was impeccable in his dragflick to put the ball past Gope in the 18th minute to fetch Pakistan a 1-0 lead.With a little over seven minutes remaining for the second hooter, Bangladesh missed a brilliant opportunity when skipper Rashel Mahmud assisted Milon Hossain to take a shot on goal but unfortunately the later couldn’t connect the ball. Hossain missed another fantastic opportunity to equalise when he made an accelerating run from midfield, penetrating the circle to take a shot on goal but his fiercely-struck ball went too far left of the post.Post the ten-minute halftime, Pakistan took complete control of the match when they scored back-to-back goals in the 33rd minute. First, it was Shakeel Ammad Butt who found the top net to beat Gope in a penalty stroke to take a 2-0 lead. This was followed by a scintillating counter-attack by Pakistan that set a splendid field goal by Arslan Mohammad Qadir to take Pakistan’s score to a comfortable 3-0.The final quarter saw Bangladesh push desperately for goals but Pakistan stayed on top of their game with 64 per cent ball possession. Pakistan enhanced their lead with another successful penalty corner well-converted by Abu Mahmood in the 41st minute. In the 47th minute Shakeel Ammad Butt showcased excellent dribbling abilities to penetrate the circle and take a successful shot on goal to take his team’s lead to a formidable 5-0. Abu Mahmood took this lead to 6-0 with his third goal of the match in the 50th minute when he converted a penalty corner. Arslan Mohammad Qadir added to his team's goal-fest with a 60th-minute field goal that helped Pakistan walk away with the winning points.Pakistan meet Japan on October 13 while Bangladesh will take on India."

1392,"LONDON: British opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn told Prime Minister Theresa May on Wednesday that if she could not unite her divided party she should quit.""If a prime minister can´t lead, she should leave,"" the Labour leader told MPs in the House of Commons.Last week, May fought off a plot to oust her by around 30 of her Conservative lawmakers, sparked by her disastrous speech to the party´s annual conference.But her position remains fragile, even as negotiations on Britain´s withdrawal from the European Union approach a crucial stage.In the first prime minister´s question time since the plot was revealed, Corbyn focused on pressing May on welfare reforms, which he said were leading claimants into poverty.But he also condemned May´s wider approach, saying: ""Everywhere you look it´s a government in chaos. On the most important issues facing this country, it´s a shambles.""This government is more interested in fighting amongst themselves than in solving these problems.""May responded by listing the government´s achievements on the economy, jobs, health, and education -- while accusing Labour of struggling with anti-Semitism in its ranks.Conservative MPs also heckled Corbyn when he spoke of in-fighting, referencing the fact that only a year ago, his own lawmakers had tried unsuccessfully to remove him.May´s authority was severely weakened by a snap election in June that she called to cement her power, but which saw the Conservatives lose their parliamentary majority.Speculation of a leadership challenge was revived last month by an intervention from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, which challenged her Brexit strategy and laid bare cabinet rifts over Britain´s future.Johnson and other senior ministers rallied around at the weekend, but questions remain over how long May can last.The open divisions come at a crucial time in the Brexit talks, as EU leaders next week are due to decide whether the negotiations can move past the terms of the divorce on to the issue of trade."
1393,"KARACHI: The police have deployed personnel from its specialised cells and a heavy contingent to solve the mystery of knife attacks in the city, but even after 15 days, the accused remains at large.Sindh IGP A.D Khawaja is under immense pressure to nab the person or persons responsible for the attacks. According to recent reports, the IG has taken force from specialised task forces into the loop.The IGP has given the task of arresting the knife attacker to personnel of Anti-Car Lifting Cell, special investigation units that operate against dacoits and extortionists, Anti-Violent Crime Cell and the Counter-Terrorism Department.Attacks in Punjab's Chichawatni area started in 2013, left 50 women injuredMoreover, personnel in civil clothes have been deployed in areas that have so far come under target – Gulshan-e-Iqbal and Gulistan-e-Jauhar.

These terrorists are challenging our nation by attacking our women,” he said in a statement.The PPP chairman also asked the judiciary to direct the police to ensure protection of women. "

1399,"WASHINGTON: The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday launched the first legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s new restrictions on people entering the United States from eight countries.The civil rights group said in a statement that it will seek to amend an existing lawsuit in Maryland federal court that was filed against Trump’s previous March 6 ban.In a letter filed with US District Court Judge Theodore Chuang, the ACLU said the new proposal announced on Sunday violates the US Constitution as well as federal immigration law.Trump’s new ban places indefinite restrictions on travel to the United States for citizens from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad, and North Korea. Certain government officials from Venezuela will also be barred.The ACLU will seek an injunction that would block visa and entry restrictions on those affected.Challengers of Trump’s immigration restrictions have said the bans are aimed at following through on a pledge he made on the campaign trail in 2016 to block Muslims from entering the country.“President Trump’s newest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core, and it certainly engages in discrimination based on national origin, which is unlawful,” Anthony Romero — the ACLU’s executive director — said.“We’ll see President Trump in court — again,” he added.The new ban — Trump’s third — could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors. Trump has argued that the restrictions fulfil his campaign pledge to tighten immigration and security.“The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the president’s inherent authority to keep this country safe,” said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior.The ACLU represents several nonprofit groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project as well as individuals who say they would be affected by the ban, which goes into effect on October 18.Chuang was one of two district court judges who blocked Trump’s second travel ban, saying “it is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban”.Legal experts say the new ban is likely on more solid footing than the previous bans, in part because it was implemented following a detailed review by federal agencies.Trump’s first travel ban aimed at seven Muslim-majority countries, issued soon after he took office in January, was blocked by courts following chaotic scenes at airports.The second ban — targeting six countries — was blocked by lower courts and partially revived by the Supreme Court in June."

""Anything new is glamorous and attractive but because of poor maintenance and indifference, operation of existing policies bring lots of losses in the country,"" he said.The seminar has been organised by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), in collaboration with Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry.An ISPR statement said Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa will be the keynote speaker at the event. The seminar was earlier scheduled on 31 August but postponed due to weather hazard, according to the ISPR.Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, in his talk, said that crafting a new narrative is the way forward.He further said that we need a collective approach and that there should be zero tolerance for corruption.Dr Ashfaq Hassan while speaking about the CPEC said that leadership, policy and reforms will determine the benefits Pakistan will reap from the plan. Hassan said that China wants to relocate its industries in Pakistan, according to ISPR.In his address, Dr Hassan said that the details of the CPEC should be shared with the public and the stake holders.While dismissing general suspicions that China is likely to become the East India Company and the project passing through disputed territory, Hassan said described the history of Karakoram Highway and Mangla Dam.Dr Farrukh Saleem also addressed the participants and discussed threats to economic security in the context of national security, said the ISPR.Dr Saleem also utilised the aid of data in his address to elaborate things, saying that Pakistan needs to focus on economic growth while making the most of economic security. Chairman Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Zubair Tufail said that Pakistan needs to follow the steps of China in order to become economically stronger.He said that Pakistan needs to allow third world countries for investment and should ask China to open more markets for Pakistan.

1405,"LONDON: Prime Minister Azad Jammu and Kashmir Raja Farooq Haider said that it’s an open secret now that former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif was disqualified on weak and unjustified grounds of Iqama [work permit] and not the Panama Papers.Speaking to the media here, he said Nawaz’s disqualification has been rejected by Kashmiris because it’s a well-known fact now that his ouster has nothing to do with accountability and has damaged Pakistan.The AJK prime minister along with senior minister Tariq Farooq is visiting European capitals to apprise them about the human rights violations of Kashmiris by Indian occupation forces.Haider said that the case against Nawaz started on the basis of Panama but ended up on Iqama because no evidence of any kind of wrongdoing in public office was found against Nawaz but Iqama was used to oust him to ‘damage Pakistan’.The AJK premier said that Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) are suffering because of India’s oppression.He said that governments in Pakistan since 1947 have followed the same Kashmir policy and have always taken up the issue of Kashmir in the right manner advocating the right of self-determination for the people of Kashmir.“We are meeting European parliamentarians and think-tanks for a week to inform them about the heinous crimes India is committing. There’s evidence that India is involved in crimes against humanity,” he said.Farooq said that Nawaz remains popular in the country due to his vast support base and his disqualification has made him more popular because the whole legal fraternity of Pakistan as well as international community is of the same view that he has been punished to settle political scores.Farooq said that Nawaz Sharif’s disqualification has weakened Pakistan’s case at the international level because it has given an impression that a popularly elected leader can be thrown out through courts in a ""political chess game"".He said its obvious that Nawaz was disqualified in hurry and is now being victimised through a media slandering campaign and witch-hunt through National Accountability courts."
1406,"BUENOS AIRES: A nation exploded with relief on Tuesday as Lionel Messi single-handedly dragged his Argentina team into next year´s World Cup finals with a spellbinding hat-trick in Quito. ""Messi is E.T. He´s from another planet. He´s not from this world,"" Marco Mouras, a 28-year-old Brazilian said in a crowded Buenos Aires bar as Argentinians around him went wild, beer and pizza spilling onto the floor.Messi gave the world a masterclass of what it would be missing if he didn´t go to Russia 2018, a distinct possibility when Argentina went a goal down inside the first minute of a match they had to win.A graveyard silence descended on bars, restaurants and homes when Ecuador´s Romario Ibarra struck in the first minute of the game, casting a pall of gloom across Argentina as he scored.It was proof for the doomsayers that this team was a lost cause. Argentinians had suffered too much during a lacklustre qualification series and this was the last straw.But Messi burst through the gloom to equalize and then soon scored again to give Argentina the lead. ""2-1 was not enough. We couldn´t be calm,"" said Lautaro Gonzalez, 35, celebrating after being put through an emotional wringer by his national team.Beside him a disbelieving Maximiliano Lacasa proclaimed himself a devotee of ""Saint Messi. Thank God we have him."" Pride in the shirt was restored when Messi completed his hat-trick in the second half. It was time for Argentinians at home to believe again. Pablo Ramos, 34, could hardly take it in. The team is still a misfiring mess going to the World Cup, he said, ""so it´s all suffering.""Even music yielded to Messi when Irish rockers U2 delayed their concert by almost two hours to allow fans in the La Plata stadium near Buenos Aires time to watch the match on giant screens. When they finally came on stage, they kicked off a giant party.With seemingly everyone crowded around every available TV set, the streets of Buenos Aires were so empty it seemed like a curfew. People wore the Argentine shirt in the build-up, but not many. The Argentine public had grown tired of believing in vain.A win seemed a little too fanciful to most, exasperated by a series of underwhelming performances by the national side.Only a win would do in Quito, where Argentina hadn´t won since 2001. The nation held its breath. Nobody here, or anywhere else, wanted to comtemplate the unthinkable but very real prospect of Argentina losing. That would mean next year´s World Cup in Russia would go ahead without Messi, arguably the world´s greatest player.""It´s complicated, I want the team to be at the World Cup in Russia, but only a miracle can save them. I´m going to pray for them,"" said Maria Cordoba, a 64-year-old optician.Cometh the hour, cometh the man, and now Argentina will bask in the fact that the ""Messiah"" will lead them to the World Cup finals.Team coach Jorge Sampaoli said he had told his players: ""Messi doesn´t owe the World Cup to Argentina, football owes the World Cup to Messi.""""Messi is the best player in history and I´m really excited to be able to be in a group, close to him.""The main concerns of most Argentinians is the economy and the loss of purchasing power, but the torments of the national team has relegated even that into the background. The nation yearns for a return to the glory days of 1978 and 1986 when Argentina won the World Cup.Over to you, Mr Messi."

1409,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday dismissed the request of Milli Muslim League (MML), the political front of the Jamaat-ud-Daa'wa (JuD), to register as a political party.Sources said the decision was based on the Interior Ministry's directions that the MML not be allowed to register as a political party owing to its links with a banned outfit. Earlier on Wednesday, an ECP bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Justice (retd) Sardar Raza Khan had reserved the decision on the matter.The ECP had told MML counsel Advocate Raja Abdur Rehman that the letter written by the Interior Ministry objecting the registration says the party is associated with a proscribed outfit. To this, Rehman replied that no party member has any association with any proscribed outfit and that the party has fulfilled all legal requirements for registration.The ECP wondered why the party is not approaching the ministry regarding the issue, to which the MML asked under what law should the party approach the Interior Ministry.The Ministry of Interior in September wrote to the ECP conveying its objection to the candidature of MML nominee Mohammad Yaqoob Sheikh in the NA-120 by-election.Sheikh is affiliated with Jamaat-ud-Daa'wa (JuD) and his party has been registered under a new name to contest the election, the letter read.The JuD is under scrutiny after the Interior Ministry listed in the Second Schedule of the ATA 1997 in January this year.Sheikh independently contested the NA-120 by-election in Lahore last month on the electoral symbol of an 'energy saver', bagging 5,822 votes — securing the number four position.Though he lost to Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz candidate Kulsoom Nawaz, the gaining of almost 6,000 votes by a first-time candidate surprised analysts.MoFA asks interior ministry to keep an eye on banned outfits; interior ministry recommends ECP not to register MML“Recent political activities of the group [Milli Muslim League] have also been officially objected at diplomatic level — Ministry of Foreign Affairs has highlighted our international obligations and commitment to National Action Plan and recommended that Ministry of Interior take up the matter of registration and activities of MML and its association with proscribed organisations with the Election Commission of Pakistan to avoid any negative consequences for Pakistan and therefore recommended that MML application for registration should not be supported for registration,” read the content of the letter the Interior Ministry wrote the ECP.“The Ministry of Interior has taken up the issue with security agencies. The reply of one agency is awaited; while the other agency has intimated that indulgence of proscribed/under observation organisation in the political process with an aim to win legitimacy is a serious issue, thereby neutralising the gains of the National Action Plan. Given the clamour, philosophy, outreach and modus operandi to operate, it is difficult to believe that the MML will tread its own path, completely at variance with its mother organisation. In view of the above, the registration of MML is not supported,” read the letter exclusively made available with The News."

1417,"KUALA LUMPUR: She has already captured hearts across Asia by taking on corrupt politicians and fighting bad guys who tried to shut girls’ schools – and now even the United Nations has been wowed by a superheroine whose only weapons are pens and books.Move over Superman and Batman. Here comes Pakistan’s superheroine Burka Avenger who might soon be spreading her message of peace and tolerance on behalf of the UN.The Emmy-nominated animated TV series has won global accolades since its 2013 launch, with its female protagonist - a teacher called Jiya - putting on the veil at night and transforming into an all-action heroine to tackle social ills.Now the UN is seeking to tap her popularity as it ramps up a campaign that emphasizes women’s role in peacebuilding to combat extremism.“We have a lot of shared goals,” the series’ creator, Pakistani pop star Haroon Rashid, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Islamabad.“The whole concept (of Burka Avenger) came about because I was reading about girls’ schools being shut down and bombed by extremists, and women and girls are threatened with violence. That’s why the superheroine was created,” he said.Rashid will be speaking at a UN Women conference in the Thai capital Bangkok this week which will look at using creative approaches to promote women’s role in peacebuilding.Although there is no official partnership yet, the UN agency and Rashid both said they were keen to explore collaboration, including by making Burka Avenger an ambassador.“Burka Avenger can be a great messenger not only for women’s issues but because it’s animation, you can highlight very sensitive issues, it makes them (appear) softer,” Rashid said.Burka Avenger was launched first in Pakistan, then Afghanistan, India and this year in Indonesia. It has been produced in different languages including Urdu, Tamil, Hindi, Pashto and Indonesian.The series has won numerous accolades, including the Peabody Award, International Gender Equity Prize and the Asian Media Award, while the protagonist Jiya was named one of the most influential fictional characters of 2013 by Time magazine.Orphaned as a child, Jiya was adopted by a master of a mystic martial art called Takht Kabaddi, which uses pens and books as weapons to take on enemies.There has also been debate over Jiya’s choice of disguise, the burqa.The all-encompassing veil has typically been viewed as symbol of female repression in the West but the cartoon presents it in a different light, as a symbol of female empowerment.UN Women Asia-Pacific head Miwa Kato said cartoons can help prevent extremism from a young age.“We often look to law enforcement to prevent extremism but it starts very early from a child’s age, through TV and entertainment,” Kato told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“A girl and superhero using pens and books as weapons can make us start having a conversation, at home or in schools.”Burka Avenger is set for more launches in Asia - including Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Brunei, Singapore and Bangladesh - but after four seasons and 52 episodes, Rashid said he has no plans to work on new episodes immediately although he is planning a full-length feature film.“We believe that will help spread the message on a larger scale, to a larger audience,” the pop star said."

More than 700,000 residents of New York City identify as Puerto Rican, along with nearly as many people elsewhere in the state, according to non-governmental studies.""We know how much destruction has been done, and how hard it is going to be to rebuild Puerto Rico,"" Cuomo said.""We also know that given the financial pressures that the island was under before, it makes the task even more difficult,"" he said."

1421,"WASHINGTON: Internet giants, including Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O), are moving to compromise on several major policy issues as they adjust to an abrupt shift in the political winds in Washington.Just last week, the US Senate took a big step toward advancing legislation that would partially strip away the internet industry’s bedrock legal protection, a 1996 law that shields companies from liability for the activities of their users.At the same time, Democratic senators are writing legislation that would create new disclosure rules for online political ads after Facebook this month revealed that suspected Russian trolls purchased more than $100,000 worth of divisive ads on its platform during the 2016 election cycle. The US Federal Election Commission is considering bringing in Facebook and other tech firms for a public hearing.Unlike in Europe, where they have faced a bevy of new rules and billion-dollar fines, internet giants have avoided virtually all types of government regulation in the United States, even as their market power continues to grow. Amazon (AMZN.O), for example, controls more than a third of US online commerce, while Google and Facebook combined account for more than sixty percent of the US digital ad market.Internet firms have from their inception urged US politicians in both parties to treat their industry as a nascent sector in need of unique protections. These firms enjoyed an especially close relationship with the Democratic administration of former President Barack Obama, which saw several officials go to work for Google upon leaving the White House.But some Democrats, still bitter over Russia’s alleged meddling in the 2016 election, are now expressing alarm at the industry’s power. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this month compared political ads on social media to the “wild, wild West” and is working on legislation to require more disclosure.On the Republican side, President Donald Trump has been hostile to the tech industry in many of his public remarks. Google and Facebook have been repeatedly attacked from the right for alleged liberal bias and a globalist outlook.Now, the Internet firms are backpedaling from earlier positions as they seek to avoid regulation, according to congressional aides, industry lobbyists and company sources.“Tech is no longer the golden goose,” said one technology industry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Maybe it’s a good thing we start behaving like a rational part of the economy.”Silicon Valley lobbyists and congressional aides in both parties were quick to temper talk of a sweeping regulatory crackdown, in part because the government agencies that could move against the industry, notably the Federal Trade Commission, remain severely understaffed.But the shift in tone is palpable.On Thursday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the company, for the first time, would make it possible for anyone to see details about political ads that run on Facebook, which, unlike television ads, do not fall under US law requiring disclosure of who pays for them. Requiring such transparency is one of the key provisions of the proposed legislation on online political ads.The company also said it would turn over to congressional investigators political ads that it says were likely purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 US presidential election.The moves marked an about-face for Zuckerberg, who after the November election said it was a “crazy idea” to think that activity on Facebook swayed the vote.Facebook has also shifted its stance on proposed changes to the liability protections for internet companies, formally known as Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act. The legislation, which is aimed at stopping online sex trafficking, has been fiercely opposed by companies that see it as a threat to openness and innovation on the internet.But after an emotional hearing last week featuring testimony from the mother of a murdered sex-trafficking victim - which followed two big tech companies, Oracle (ORCL.N) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE.N), breaking ranks with industry peers on the issue - Facebook and Google have opened the door to negotiation on the bill, according to congressional aides and industry sources.In a statement, Erin Egan, Facebook’s vice president of US policy, said the company believed a legislative solution was possible to “address this terrible problem while ensuring that the internet remains open and free and that responsible companies can continue to work to stop sex trafficking before it happens.”The tech industry in recent years has neutralized other ideas percolating in the halls of Congress that it perceived as threatening, including calls to weaken encryption and demands that social media companies report “terrorist” activity to the government.But the effort to amend Section 230 is seen as different. The fast progress of legislation, introduced in August, has alarmed lobbyists and company representatives who initially predicted it would not go far in an otherwise gridlocked Congress.The bill comes after years of law enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others who fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms.Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, the lead architect of the Section 230 legislation, said in an interview with Reuters that he was confident his measure would become law this congressional term, with or without Silicon Valley’s cooperation.The bill has attracted bipartisan support from nearly a third of the Senate; a companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Portman said he had met with Trump’s daughter and advisor, Ivanka Trump, who expressed strong support.“Frankly, I am disappointed (that) more in the technology industry are not joining us on this effort,” Portman said. “It is in their interest to be supportive of a solution on this problem.”"
1422,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has suspended programme loans/budgetary support for Pakistan owing to deteriorating macroeconomic indicators; however, the Washington-based lender will continue providing project loans to Islamabad, it is learnt. “Last month, the WB team conveyed Pakistani authorities that they cannot provide programme loans/budgetary support because of macroeconomic indicators,” sources from the World Bank based in Washington confirmed to The News here on Sunday.The WB, they said, linked provision of programme lending with letter of comfort (LoC) from the IMF. The IMF used to gauge the economic health of the country on the basis of macroeconomic indicators, so it seemed that dark clouds had started hovering around Islamabad for luring them for entering into another bailout package from the IMF. Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves had started depleting in the wake of rising current account deficit, and it had already evaporated around $4.5b in last few months after saying goodbye to the IMF. Now, the reserves held by the SBP stood at $14.7b and around $4b forward booking the net reserves were just over $10b which could hardly meet three months import bill requirements. When contacted a top official at the Finance Division on Sunday evening, he said that the WB did not formally convey about halting programme loan for Pakistan. He said that Islamabad had not yet made any request for the programme loan. He also said that Pakistan and the IMF would hold post programme monitoring (PPM) within this calendar year, but its exact schedule and venue was not yet finalised. The WB provides its assistance in shape of IDA and IBRD, and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar had to struggle a lot for restoring IBRD lending as it provided on the basis of certain performance criteria. Now, again this lending was halted for the time being till Pakistan improves its economic indicators by raising foreign currency reserves level in months ahead.After disqualification from the IBRD, now Pakistan will be able to borrow through the IDA only in accordance with its allocated quota and additional borrowing in shape of IBRD will remain suspended until the country improves its macroeconomic indicators.In the WB’s latest report on Pakistan, the Bank stated that since coming to power in 2013, the Government of Pakistan implemented an ambitious economic reform programme. As a result, external and internal macroeconomic balances improved markedly, and the country made strides in important agendas, such as taxation, the energy sector and the business environment. As the government completed four years in office, there are concerns that progress is stalling. The first half of FY17 suggests deteriorating internal and external balances. Privatisation efforts have stalled, which has also affected the broader reform efforts in the electricity sector, with the resurgence of circular debt.Reforms in areas that require collaboration between federal and provincial governments remain challenging. Reform momentum will need to continue to maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate growth.However, the Finance Ministry spokesman stated that the current account deficit reached $2.6b (0.76 percent of the GDP) in July-August FY 2018, from $1.3b (0.42 percent of the GDP) in last year. On MoM basis, the external account position is showing an improvement and CA improved by 73 percent during August 2017 over July 2017 on account of better exports, remittances and FDI growth. Exports: Exports started showing positive results during FY2018 due to several initiatives for the promotion and facilitation of exports, such as mark-up rates has been reduced on Export Re-finance Facility (ERF) from 8.4 percent to 3.0 percent. Prime Minister’s package of Rs180b is also aiding the export sector. During Jul-Aug FY2018, exports posted a significant growth of 17.9 per cent and on MoM basis 14.3 per cent in August 2017.Remittances: During July-August FY2018, overseas Pakistani workers remitted $3.496b as compared to$ 3.089b received during the same period in the preceding year, which is higher by 13.18 per cent.FDI: FDI amounted to $2.411b during FY2017 compared to $2.305b during same period last year, posting a growth of 4.6 per cent. During July-August, FY2018, FDI posted a significant growth of 154.9 per cent which bodes well for the balance of payment, the spokesman concluded.— Originally published in The News"

1424,"LOS ANGELES: A wave of protests swept across the National Football League on Sunday as President Donald Trump escalated his feud with players who kneel during the US national anthem to draw attention to racial injustice.Trump ignited a firestorm of criticism after comments on Friday in which he described NFL players who chose to take a knee through renditions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as ""sons of b******"" who should be fired.The US leader doubled down on those remarks in an early morning tweet, urging fans to boycott the NFL as long as the protests continued.""If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!"" Trump wrote.Yet players throughout America´s most popular sport took a defiant stance just hours later, kneeling, linking arms or raising clenched fists during the anthem.More than 150 players could be seen kneeling or sitting in the 14 games that took place Sunday, easily the largest such demonstration since former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick first began protesting in 2016.One of the biggest protests took place in the nation´s capital, where almost the entire lineup of the Oakland Raiders team sat on their bench ahead of their game with the Washington Redskins.A day of demonstrations began at the London game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Baltimore Ravens at Wembley Stadium, where a large number of players from both teams knelt.In Nashville, neither the Seattle Seahawks nor the Tennessee Titans took to the field to observe the national anthem.""We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of this color in this country,"" Seattle players said in a statement just prior to kickoff.In Foxborough, around 15 members of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots took a knee during the anthem.Star quarterback Tom Brady stood but linked arms with his teammates. Reports said the protests were greeted with scattered boos as some fans chanted ""Stand up!""Patriots receiver Brandin Cooks, who scored the game-winning touchdown, later explained his decision to kneel, rejecting accusations it was unpatriotic.""A lot of people think we´re disrespecting the flag and the military, but my father was a marine, my uncle was a marine, family fought in the Vietnam war -- I have the utmost respect for the men and women that fight for our freedom,"" Cooks told reporters.In Chicago, the Pittsburgh Steelers chose to remain in their locker room during the anthem ahead of their clash with the Bears.Buffalo Bills star Lesean McCoy, who stretched on the turf during the anthem, said: ""I can´t stand and support something where the leader of our country is acting like a jerk.""In Detroit, meanwhile, the singer of the national anthem Rico LaVelle dramatically dropped to his knee at the end of his rendition. At least eight Detroit Lions players were seen kneeling during the anthem while others linked arms.Trump responded to the protests on Twitter. ""Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable,"" he wrote.In subsequent remarks to reporters, Trump denied there was a racial dimension to his criticism of activist athletes, most of whom are black.""This has nothing to do with race or anything else. This has to do with respect for our country and respect for our flag,"" Trump said.The players´ protests were the latest twist in a bitter war of words between Trump and US professional sports.On Saturday, he had also drawn a furious backlash from NBA stars after stating on Twitter that the champion Golden State Warriors and star Stephen Curry would not be invited to attend a White House reception.Trump´s outburst drew a stinging response from across the NBA, with Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James describing the US leader as a ""bum.""The trenchant response from NFL and NBA players to Trump´s comments had shown signs of spreading to other leagues, with a baseball player kneeling during the anthem on Saturday.In game one of the WNBA Finals on Sunday, members of the Los Angeles Sparks remained in their dressing room during the anthem. Their opponents, the Minnesota Lynx, stood to attention with arms locked.Track and field star Allyson Felix, a six-time Olympic gold medallist, also spoke out in support of the protests.""Enough is enough. We have the power to create change,"" she said.Kaepernick´s protest was aimed at drawing more attention to treatment of minorities in America following a spate of deadly police shootings of black men.Critics counter that the protests are disrespectful of the country and its military."

The successful passage of the bill has provided legal justification for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to head the Pakistan Muslim League –Nawaz.A consultative party meeting on the issue was convened by MQM-P leader Farooq Sattar, seeking clarification from the lawmaker about his support to the PML-N.Later, while talking to the press, Sattar informed that the party decided to terminate the basic membership of the senator for his vote against the party policy.

1427,"ISLAMABAD: Nancy Stiegler has participated in the counting of nearly half a billion people, in African deserts, Pacific archipelagos and the teeming megacities of Asia.She is one of just a handful of technical experts -- and only two women -- travelling the world to advise countries on obtaining solid census data in troubled regions.""You have to fight for a month (for them to understand) that you're not a dumb blonde,"" said Stiegler, who argues that reliable census data is a foundation of democracy.""But once you make yourself heard, it becomes an advantage (to be female as) a relationship of trust is better established.""In Pakistan, where she has been assisting the militancy-struck nation with its first census in almost two decades, the ash blonde is hard to miss at the Bureau of Statistics office.She has helped train officials to ensure that the population is as accurately assessed as possible -- especially making sure that all women were counted.In Pakistan, women can be reluctant to respond to census officials who are almost always male, while some men are hesitant to name female family members to a stranger.""Statistically, we can correct... the underestimation of women but only to a certain point,"" Stiegler said.She has helped the country devise awareness campaigns aimed at persuading civil society groups, religious figures, and politicians to endorse the census.The weeks-long surveying process kicked off this spring, a challenge that required a team of more than 300,000 people and involved 55 million forms.Following the completion of the survey in May, Stiegler is now helping oversee the detailed data analysis of the census results, which could take months.But not all have welcomed the survey, with politicians nervous about electoral maps being redrawn and militants threatening violence.In April, a Taliban suicide attack targeting a census team killed seven people and wounded 19 others in Lahore.Such challenges are nothing new for 40-year-old Stiegler.""The census is a very sensitive exercise, a political and economic tool that can prevent politicians from doing whatever they want,"" says Stiegler, who has also worked on projects during delicate transition periods in Myanmar, Sudan and Timor Leste.""The census has all the more impact because it affects the electoral map... and the redistribution of resources are often based on the population,"" she explains.Stiegler was first attracted to challenging environments during her childhood as she watched broadcasts of Biafra refugees fleeing violence during the Nigerian civil war on television.Inspired to make a difference, she pursued demography studies in Bordeaux and at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, one of the most recognised research centres in the field.In 2003 she moved to South Africa where she founded the Institute of Population Studies at the University of the Western Cape, which she still runs.Stiegler juggles university life and fieldwork, returning to South Africa during holidays to teach intensive courses on social demography and survey methods.""I like this fieldwork... perhaps it's because I have a bit of a taste for risk,"" she smiled, recounting an incident when she was surrounded by a crowd of enraged enumerators in Nigeria who threatened her over unpaid wages.""The best time is when the adrenaline kicks in on the first days of the census, when we see the first problems emerge."""
1428,"KARACHI: Addressing the third majlis of Muharram at Taheri Masjid here on Sunday, Dawoodi Bohra community’s spiritual leader Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin said that Almighty Allah chose Islam for showing the right path to mankind through our beloved Holy Prophet (peace be upon him).He added that Islam is the religion of peace and tranquillity, adding that providing service and welfare to human beings is equivalent to making Allah Almighty happy. “The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) and Ahle Bait rendered great sacrifices for spreading the message of peace,” he said.The spiritual leader said: “Particularly, the grandson of Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA), who was hungry and thirsty for three days, had fought on the hot sand of Karbala against the tormentors and laid his precious life in the way of Almighty Allah.” He further added that the exemplary sacrifices made by Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his people had become a lifetime example in the history of humankind.Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin thanked the Government of Pakistan, people of Pakistan and the people in power for making high-level security arrangements for the majlis. He also thanked the prime minister and interior minister for making this visit possible and for coordinating and cooperating during the entire process.The spiritual leader said that this was the love of Pakistani people and the government that was leading towards enhanced mutual ties. By referring to Syedna Taher Saifuddin and Syedna Mohammad Burhanuddin, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin said that both these religious leaders had visited Pakistan many times and directed their community to work towards the betterment and welfare of Pakistan.The spiritual leader of Dawoodi Bohra community, on the occasion, said that he was very delighted on getting the opportunity to address Muharram majalis in Karachi after a long gap as his (Syedna’s) father and grandfather earlier used to address Muharram majalis in the city.He said that steps and measures adopted by the government and law-enforcement agencies for the restoration of law and order situation in the country in general and in Karachi, in particular, were highly praiseworthy.He said that initiation of development projects in the city was a welcoming sign as it would provide the best communication facilities to people. He thanked the administration for adopting strict security measures and giving other facilities to participants of the Muharram congregations.On the other hand, Sindh Governor Mohammad Zubair said that the arrival and stay of the spiritual leader of Dawoodi Bohra community, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, in Karachi during the sacred month of Muharram shows an improvement in law and order of the city.The Sindh governor stated this on Sunday as he met the spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community here at the Taheri Masjid, Saddar. He also attended the Muharram majlis addressed by Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin.Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan chief Dr Farooq Sattar, Mayor Karachi Waseem Akhtar and Sindh Local Govt Minister Jam Khan Shoro were also present on the occasion.The meeting took into consideration the role of the Dawoodi Bohra community in development, progress and stabilisation of peace in the province.Speaking on the occasion, the Sindh governor said that he welcomed the decision of spiritual head of Dawoodi Bohra community to visit Karachi during Muharram after a long gap. He hoped that Syedna, in future, would continue to hold his Muharram majalis in Karachi.He acknowledged that the Dawoodi Bohra community was one of the most peace-loving sections of the society. He said the Dawoodi Bohra community had always played an important role in promotion of economic and trade activities in Karachi, which is rightly considered as the business hub of the country.The Sindh governor said that the development of Karachi meant the development of the entire country as the city offered massive prospects of trade and investment after restoration of law and order here.Speaking to the media on the occasion, the Sindh governor said that stringent security measures had been put in place during the sacred month of Muharram in order to thwart any untoward incident. He said that concerned citizens were required to extend cooperation to the government for maintaining law and order as peace could not be ensured without the support of public. He said that Ulema of all sects had complete consensus of opinion that beliefs and teachings of each others’ sect should be given due respect and honour.Governor Zubair said that teachings of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) were for the entire world as the maternal grandson of the Last Prophet (SAW) had laid down his life and that of his companions for upholding the flag of Islam as after this noble sacrifice, Islam had become an exemplary religion for the entire world.Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said that he had invited the spiritual leader of Dawoodi Bohra community, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, to spend Muharram in the city and address his majalis and he had kindly consented to his request.He said this while talking to the media just after listening to the majlis of Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin at Taheri Masjid Saddar.He said that it was an event where Syedna was addressing the majlis of his community in the city in which his followers had come from other countries also. “We have made necessary security arrangements for his majlis,” he said. “Our Bohri brothers were peaceful and cooperative; they have also cooperated with the administration for their security.”Syed Murad Ali Shah said that peace has been restored in the city with constant efforts and political will of the government. “This credit goes to the people of Karachi who supported the targeted operation and also extended their full support to the government, Rangers, police and other law enforcement agencies in restoring peace,” he said.The chief minister said that with the restoration of peace in the city, a boost had been witnessed in the business activities. “People, with their families, have been coming out of their homes for outings without any fear,” he said. “Syedna has come from India to address his majalis and this is happening after 21 years.”The Sindh chief minister expressed his satisfaction that the city is again attracting and respecting its visitors, guests, investors and religious scholars and spiritual leaders.Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, just after his address, presented a shawl, rosary and a prayer mat to the chief minister.Later, the chief minister reviewed the arrangements for the Dawoodi Bohra community’s other majlis at the KPI ground. He visited their kitchen, dispensary and sitting places. The chief minister issued directives to Additional IG Karachi Mushtaq Mahar and Commissioner Karachi Aijaz Ali Khan to keep in touch with the management of the Bohra Jamaat majalis and other programmes and provide them necessary security, support, and whatever else was required by them.Mayor Karachi Wasim Akhtar and MQM-Pakistan chief Dr Farooq Sattar also paid a visit to the Taheri Masjid in Saddar on Sunday where they met with Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin — the 53rd spiritual leader of the Dawoodi Bohra community and expressed well wishes on his visit to Pakistan.Talking to media representatives on this occasion, Dr Farooq Sattar stressed the need for promoting Ittehad Bain-ul-Muslimeen, which he said was the need of the hour. He said the arrival of Dr Mufaddal Saifuddin was in fact a message of love and unity and all of their people work for peace and harmony around the world.He said in the month of Muharram, we all should show the mutual understanding and unity to prove that we are peace-loving people and want progress and development of our city and country.Akhtar, while talking to the leaders of Bohra community, said this community had a big role in the development and progress of Karachi and they always supported promotion of love and harmony among the people.He said the development works, including road carpeting, street lights maintenance and cleanliness were started in the city before the start of Muharram and now these are being completed rapidly so that the citizens could be saved from any inconvenience while performing religious rituals during Muharram.He said currently their top-most priority is arrangement for cleanliness and road repair and carpeting around the Imambarghas and other locations in the city. The Bohra community leaders thanked Dr Farooq Sattar and Mayor Karachi Wasim Akhtar for visiting the Taheri Masjid.This report was originally published in The News"
1429,"COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh: The World Health Organisation warned Monday of a growing cholera risk in the makeshift refugee camps in Bangladesh where more than 435,000 Rohingya Muslims have sought shelter from unrest in Myanmar.A month after the exodus began, those dispersed in some 68 camps and settlements along the border do not have safe drinking water and hygiene facilities, according to the WHO.The camps also face dire shortages of food and medicine in what has quickly become one of the world's largest refugee settlements.""Risk of water-borne diseases is high, especially there is a very high risk of cholera and this is why everyone is concerned,"" the WHO said in a statement.""Interventions are being scaled-up, however, the situation remains critical and challenging.""The latest influx has overwhelmed the camps around Cox's Bazar, which previously housed at least 300,000 people who had fled earlier violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state.The WHO says mobile medical centres have been set up, while Bangladesh health authorities say they have treated some 4,500 Rohingya for diarrhoea in a month and vaccinated some 80,000 children for measles and polio.""We are trying our best to face the challenges. But we are concerned,"" Enayet Hossain, deputy head of Bangladesh's health services department, told AFP.The department said that at least 10 Rohingya have died in Bangladesh since the influx, most from bullet and blast wounds suffered in Rakhine.Two elderly Rohingya men died of diarrhoea at a charity clinic more than a week ago, said Misbah Uddin Ahmed, a health department official at Ukhia, where most of the camps are located.""They were also suffering from old age complications and gastroenteritis,"" he told AFP.Two Rohingya women, aged 50 and 60, were shifted to a hospital in the port city of Chittagong after they were diagnosed with HIV, police said.Ahmed said specialists from Bangladesh's International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDRB) and government scientists had visited camps to take samples.""They are going to set up two field stations here,"" he told AFP.The Doctors Without Borders (MSF) group said last week the camps were on the brink of a public health disaster as filthy water and faeces flow through shanties.It said a ""massive scale-up of humanitarian aid"" was needed, with adults on the cusp of dying from dehydration.But Ahmed said the situation was improving as hundreds of latrines and tube-wells were being dug by government services and local charities.The army, which has taken over aid management, says it has made sanitary facilities the ""highest priority"" in an effort to stave off a health emergency.""The situation is still under control,"" Ahmed said.More than 436,000 refugees have crossed the border from Rakhine since August 25 when a military crackdown was launched following attacks by Rohingya militants, according to UN figures on Monday.The refugees have given shocking accounts of killings and mass rapes by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs. The Myanmar military says they have only targeted Rohingya militants."
1430,"Poet Munir Niazi wrote a famous couplet: “Kuch sheher de log vi zaalim sun, kuch sannu maran da shaq vi si.” (The people of this city were cruel, but I also had a wish to die).Ten years after Benazir Bhutto's assassination, we are back to where we began. While we are busy pointing accusatory fingers at each other, the real killers have walked free, due to insufficient evidence. I have been following this case as a serious student, studying all related reports – by the United Nations, the Joint Investigation Team, the Punjab Special Branch and the Scotland Yard – as well as closely following the details of the investigations and inquiries into Pakistan’s most consequential political assassination. During the course of it, I met over 100 people who had a role in the happenings and interviewed the investigators. This resulted in a 750-page book that I authored under the title, “Qatil Kaun?” By no means is the book the final word on the murder inquiry. But, for me, it was the first step towards understanding the case. If you ask me today, I will tell you that Bhutto’s murder inquiry was, and is, the most thoroughly investigated case in the history of Pakistan.The recent remarks by former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf and Pakistan People’s Party leader Asif Zardari are merely politically point scoring. Both do not have any direct link with the killing. Although the Federal Investigation Agency did record Musharraf's statement and name him in the official documents, but that was only in terms of security concerns. He is never listed as one of the planners of the assassination.None of the compiled reports, by Pakistani investigation agencies, name Musharraf as a suspect. However, the UN report does hold him responsible for not providing adequate security to Bhutto on the day. The report further mentions the names of other serving uniformed officers, but then-President Asif Ali Zardari and then-Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi expressed reservations about those passages in a letter to Ban Ki-moon, the UN’s Secretary General. In this way, the state of Pakistan refused to follow the UN report in its entirety. One of the UN investigators, Heraldo Munoz even compiled his findings in a book, published in 2013. On the other hand, opponents of the Pakistan People’s Party have always maintained that Bhutto’s husband, Zardari, had a hand in her murder, even though not one of the investigation agencies of Pakistan, Britain or the UN have found any direct link. Besides Zardari, fingers have also been pointed at Rehman Malik and Babar Awan accused of running off with the other bulletproof car, and at the mysterious signal by Khalid Shahenshah, a top security guard. But these accusations come from those not part of the probe. They are merely conspiracy theories, with no shred of evidence.The truth of what happened that day, as backed up by scientific evidence and investigation, is that Saeed alias Bilal was brought to Rawalpindi as a suicide bomber. DNA collected from his remains confirmed that he was from Waziristan. While data collected from telephone calls further unearthed two more facilitators, Rafaqat Hussain and Hasnain Gull, who brought Saeed and one other suicide bomber to Rawalpindi. (Both of the alleged facilitators are still in jail although the court has set them free). The men then dropped Saeed, alias Bilal, at Liaqat Bagh in a taxi. Hussain owned a taxi and had previously also facilitated a Eurasian suicide bomber named Akrama who had been assigned to target politician Sheikh Ahmed Rashid. When he could not locate Rashid, the bomber then detonated his vest outside the house of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The facilitators, Hussain and Gull, both belonged to Tehreek-e-Taliban’s Haqqania Akora Khattak faction, which pledged allegiance to Baitullah Mehsud. Pakistan’s intelligence agencies also traced out Qari Nadir, alias Ismail, and Nasrullah, alias Ahmed, who had brainwashed the bomber and provided him with an explosive-laden jacket. These facilitators were traced, arrested and interrogated by our military agencies. They later died in an encounter by law enforcement agencies. The men belonged to that militant wing of the TTP, which had aligned itself with al Qaeda and took direct orders from Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was due to this reason that Zawahiri personally claimed responsibility for the assassination. Those who pulled the trigger have been identified. But are there others, who may have indirectly facilitated the murder? Regardless, the first order of business should be to punish those who killed her, while the associates and abettors can be punished thereafter.It is not only the state’s responsibility but also that of the people to ensure that Bhutto's murderers are brought to justice. However, carelessness, indifference or cravenness may be the real impediments to closing this case. During the hearings, many witnesses refused to appear in court. Judges feared the consequences. While the proceedings were held not in courtrooms but within the state prison. A determined prosecutor was also murdered for which al Qaeda claimed responsibility. Bhutto’s own party took very little interest. And so the case languished, and the outrage increased. Everyone wanted to know if they would get justice in a country where the twice-elected prime minister could not?There needs to be a clear and dividing line between politics and crimes. Benazir Bhutto’s death was a crime and a very tragic one. Whoever wishes to use it for political gains is no well wisher of the state. If Zardari and Musharraf must spar, then let their weapons be anything but the heinous murder of Bhutto. Otherwise, the fate of this political assassination will be similar to those of many others in Pakistan. The accusations will continue to flow at those involved only by association, and not at those who killed her.Suhail Warraich is a senior journalist and analystThe views and opinions expressed are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of Geo News or the Jang Group."
1431,"SINGAPORE: A Singaporean bodybuilder has died after taking part in a celebrity Muay Thai kickboxing match, organisers said Sunday. The bout on Saturday was the first time Pradip Subramaniam, 32, had taken part in a kickboxing fight. He was competing against Steven Lim, a former contestant on a reality song contest known as Singapore Idol, who is also a kickboxing amateur. According to The Straits Times, Pradip appeared shaken after the match, which Lim won through a technical knock-out. He was helped out of the ring and taken to hospital where he died on Saturday evening. Fight organisers AFC Holding Singapore said that according to a preliminary medical report Pradip suffered ""a cardiac arrest respiratory failure episode.""Pradip was a last-minute replacement after singer Sylvester Lim, whom Steven Lim was originally slated to fight, pulled out due to insurance reasons.

1432,"LAHORE: Dozens of visually impaired people blocked the Ferozepur Road in the Punjab capital to demand rights to vocation and job security, saying their demands have long remained unmet.The protesters surrounded the Metro Bus tracks at Kalma Chowk in Garden Town, resulting in the partial suspension of the service and leaving passengers stranded.The police and Frontier Constabulary personnel reached the spot and asked the protesters to vacate the bus tracks and move the protest along the road. The protesters, however, refused to budge and demanded that a senior government functionary hold talks with them and promise the resolution of their issues. They said that they were promised in the past that their concerns would be addressed but to no avail.A similar protest was held for days in 2015 by the visually impaired when dozens gathered outside the Punjab Assembly building in protest against the Punjab government demanding an increase in the job quota for the visually impaired."
1433,"FIFA has decided to suspend the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) on account of undue third-party interference, the world football governing body announced on Wednesday.The PFF’s membership has been suspended with immediate effect in accordance with the decision of the Bureau of the FIFA Council. PFF offices and its accounts remain in control of a court-appointed administrator, which constitutes a violation of the PFF obligations to manage its affairs independently and without influence from any third parties in accordance with the FIFA Statutes, the governing body said. The suspension will be lifted once the PFF offices and access to the PFF accounts are returned to the PFF. Following its suspension, the PFF has lost all its membership rights as defined in Article 13 of the FIFA Statutes. The PFF representative and club teams are no longer entitled to take part in international competitions until the suspension is lifted, the media release stated. The suspension also means that neither the PFF nor any of its members or officials can benefit from any development programmes, courses or training from FIFA or the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).Also in accordance with Article 16 Paragraph 3 of the FIFA Statutes, other member associations may not entertain sporting contact with the PFF during its suspension, FIFA added. Earlier this year, FIFA had given a final ultimatum to authorities in Pakistan for handing over football affairs to elected-president-PFF Faisal Saleh Hayat or face suspension from membership.An official of FIFA confirmed that matters related to Pakistan Football Federation were discussed at the meeting of its Members’ Association Committee on July 4thA FIFA spokesman had said that the Members’ Association Committee had decided that “if the PFF offices and access to the PFF accounts weren’t returned to the PFF Ieadership - Ied by Mr Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat - by 31 JuIy it would recommend to the FIFA Council to suspend the PFF for contravening its obligations under articles 14 & 19 of the FIFA Statutes.""Faisal Saleh Hayyat was re-elected as President of PFF for a third time in a controversial election in June 2015, but he was never allowed to resume charge and the matters were dragged in court, which FIFA terms as against its statues. Elected president of PFF, Faisal Saleh Hayat, lamented over the suspension, calling it “bad news” for football in Pakistan. “The suspension has put our footballers’ future in danger. This is bad news. Now our players won’t be able to play internationally and even our domestic football will suffer.. it will suffer badly,” he said while speaking to Geo News. Hayat said FIFA’s laws are very clear and they do not allow for any undue third-party interference.“FIFA had sent Pakistan a very clear message. It [FIFA] had told us it would suspend us if the political interference did not end,” he said, adding that the governing body finally decided to impose the decision which it had warned of in 2015.Hayat said he did everything in his power to resolve the situation but no one cooperated.“I tried whatever I could. I approached [authorities], I even appealed to [former prime minister] Nawaz Sharif to take note of the interference, but despite all my efforts, the situation could not be resolved, unfortunately.”“I now appeal to the Chief of Army Staff to help resolve this,” he said, noting that the Pakistan Army has been taking admirable steps to promote sports in the country and project a positive image of Pakistan abroad. The PFF chief further said that the 2018 FIFA World Cup trophy, which was expected to stop over in Pakistan on February 3 next year during its global tour, may not come here at all following the latest development.“The trophy tour would have been a big boost to Pakistan’s image worldwide, but now even that tour is in danger,” he lamented. Hayat reminded again that if the PFF is not given control, the suspension would continue. “If we want to play football, we would have to follow FIFA’s laws. Otherwise, our football will suffer,” he said. "
1434,"KARACHI/GUWAHATI: The Australian cricket team's bus came under attack while touring India, where stones were pelted after the team’s victory in their Twenty20 match against the hosts on Tuesday.Australia's T20 skipper Aaron Finch, member of the visiting team, posted a photo of the brick attack on Twitter.“Pretty scary having a rock thrown through the team bus window on the way back to the hotel!!,” he tweeted.Captain David Warner, who was also on the bus, during the incident, retweeted Aaron's tweet.Earlier, Australia defeated India convincingly in the second T20 International in Guwahati to level the series 1-1. This is undoubtedly a grave security breach that questions BCCI as well as the security of the host nation. Ironically, just prior the incident, Harsha Bhogle tweeted:""Been around Indian cricket for a while but I haven't seen the kind of adulation I see in Indore, in Ranchi and especially here in Guwahati,"" the commentator said.

1435,"AMSTERDAM: Sweden claimed a World Cup playoff spot despite losing 2-0 on Tuesday away to a Netherlands side inspired by Arjen Robben who finished his international career with both goals as the Dutch bowed out. The Netherlands needed to win by a seven-goal margin to reach the playoffs but finished level on 19 points, behind Group A winners France, with the Swedes second on goal difference.The home side started brightly in the Amsterdam Arena with a fired-up Robben converting a 16th-minute penalty and then hammering home a superb left-footed shot five minutes before halftime to raise the faint hopes of the home fans.The Dutch, however, lacked the necessary creativity as Sweden shut up shop in the second half and the match fizzled out, leaving the Netherlands in third place.Sweden now enter a two-legged playoff next month against one of the other eight best second-placed European sides.Tuesday’s encounter proved to be the last international for Robben who, after 37 goals in 96 internationals, received a standing ovation as he limped through the final minutes.After the final whistle, the Swedish players went to their changing room to celebrate, leaving the stage free for Bayern Munich forward Robben to say farewell to the Dutch fans.“We knew we didn’t have a chance but it was an amazing game. It hasn’t been an easy decision but I am 33 and now must give my full focus to my club,” said Robben.Missing out on the World Cup caps a remarkable demise for the Netherlands, who were runners-up to Spain at the 2010 tournament in South Africa, and third in Brazil in 2014, with Robben again in the side, in a semi-final defeat by Argentina.They have now missed out on a second major tournament after also failing in their bid to qualify for last year’s European Championship in France.The opening goal followed a handball by Swedish defender Victor Lindelof, although Robben miscued a cheeky chip from the penalty spot and was fortunate that goalkeeper Robin Olsen had already committed to dive.Robben’s second goal, however, was a sweeping finish after the ball was laid back to him in the Swedish area. It was to be his last in the famous ‘Oranje’ national team shirt."

Her sisters, when reached home on Monday evening, found their house locked up.They entered the house after breaking the lock, but didn't find Raheema inside. Searching for their sister, when they looked into the water tank they found Raheema's body inside.Police said the deceased's hands had been tied and face covered with cloth. The body bore no torture marks.They said the cause of death could only be ascertained after the post-mortem report.Officials said Raheema's mother was murdered in the city's Saeedabad area last year, and she was a witness to it.The case pertaining to her mother's murder is sub-judice, while the four accused in it were recently released on bail, they said. Raheema had also testified in the case.The law enforcers suspect that Raheema's murder may have been connected to her mother's slaying, however, added that final investigations into the case would help ascertain the facts."
1438,"KARACHI: Fawad Alam, one of Pakistan’s most deliberately ignored cricketers, has once again reminded the national selection committee of his existence with a century in the country’s premier first class tournament, Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.On Tuesday, Fawad scored a splendid 105 off 157 deliveries at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, where he was representing his department SSGC against Lahore Blues.The same day, Pakistan’s batting collapsed in Dubai against Sri Lanka and the country lost its first home series in ten years.Many hoped that Fawad Alam would be an automatic choice after retirement of Misbah ul Haq and Younis Khan, but it didn’t happen. Selectors ignored the mountain of runs piled by Alam and picked Haris Sohail instead, who hadn’t played first class cricket for three years along with Usman Salahuddin. There’s no doubt over Haris Sohail’s talent, not at all. Haris proved his selection correct as well. But, if a Test player had to be picked without playing first class cricket in the season, then what’s the need to make players work hard in already distorted domestic cricket set up? For chief selector Inzamam ul Haq, it seems, Fawad Alam isn’t a good batsman and that’s why Usman Salahuddin, Haris Sohail and his nephew Imam ul Haq were preferred. One wonders, if someone who is scoring runs with an average of over 56 in first class cricket isn’t good enough, then who else is? May be Inzamam can answer this.But to note some records, it is worth mentioning that Fawad Alam’s batting average 56.38 in 220 first class innings is third best among all the batsmen who have made their first class debuts in 2000s. Two players with better average than Fawad are India’s Pujara and Australia’s Smith. In last three seasons, Alam scored 2070 runs at the average of 59.14.Any player, with such amount of runs to his credit and yet not getting chances would surely have lost all hopes and hung his boots. But, Fawad is defiant, and says he will continue to fight for his place. “Yeah, it is disappointing, but what can I do?” Fawad said in an exclusive chat with Geo.tv on Tuesday. “My job is to score runs, I will continue doing that and will keep knocking selectors’ doors,” added the batsman who celebrated his 32nd birthday on Sunday. Fawad is disappointed, but not demoralised. He is still hopeful for a chance. One can only hope that his performance in domestic cricket gets selectors’ attention soon.Otherwise, the curious case of Fawad Alam’s omission will leave a huge question mark on Pakistan cricket’s selection policy."
1439,"President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Sardar Masood Khan on Tuesday said that India wants to divert the attention from its continued state terrorism in Indian occupied Kashmir by attacking the Kashmiri nation and Pakistani forces on the Line of Control (LoC). ""The United Nations, in its stagnated diplomatic stance, has failed to resolve the Kashmir issue as it is under undue Indian pressure,"" Khan said in an exclusive interview with Geo News. ""Another proposition of the Fact-Finding Mission against human rights violations should be submitted to the Human Rights Council.The US has declared a Kashmiri liberation movement as a terrorist organisation on the basis of its ties with India, he said.""As per the US law, it can only declare that an organisation is a terrorist group if its agenda clashes with American interest,"" Khan said in an exclusive interview with Geo News.

1441,"BARCELONA: Catalan police tightened their protective ring around the region’s parliament on Tuesday where secessionists have pledged a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain despite warnings from Madrid of swift counter-measures.Regional leader Carles Puigdemont held a meeting of his cabinet to decide how to press an independence drive that has stirred powerful emotions across Spain and raised fears of turmoil among European Union partner states.Catalan police armed with automatic rifles guarded Barcelona’s Parc de la Ciutadella that houses the elegant 18th century parliament as it prepared to convene at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT). About 20 armoured Catalan police vans blocked every entrance to the park and the entrance to parliament itself was guarded by three armoured vans and officers wearing balaclavas.Spanish national police, denounced by separatists for their use of force to hinder the region’s Oct. 1 referendum, were not to be seen. However, the Spanish government was reinforcing security at airports and rail stations in Catalonia.Pro-independence activists were gathering around the parliament, where big screens had been set up for them to watch proceedings. Farmers parked half a dozen tractors near the assembly, flying the separatist Catalan flag.A declaration of independence would deepen Spain’s biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 and would almost certainly draw a crackdown from Madrid, possibly including suspension of Catalonia’s autonomous government.Both Spain’s government and European Council President Donald Tusk appealed to Puigdemont not to proclaim independence.“I ask you to respect, in your intentions, the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible. Diversity should not, and need not, lead to conflict, whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for the whole of Europe,” Tusk said in a speech in Brussels.The government of Spain’s wealthiest region says 90 percent of those who voted on Oct. 1 backed independence, but turnout was only 43 percent as many opponents of statehood stayed at home.The Spanish government appealed to Puigdemont to reflect and not to take an irrevocable step by declaring independence.“I want to ask Mr. Puigdemont not to do anything irreversible, not to take a path of no return, not to carry out any unilateral declaration of independence and to return to legality,” Madrid government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo told reporters.French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU should not play a mediating role in the Catalonia crisis, expressing confidence in Madrid’s ability to handle the situation.The Catalan parliament and other buildings, such as the regional high court building, could become a focus of contention between Spanish and Catalan authorities.Thousands of national police reinforcements sent by Madrid for the referendum remain in the area, many of them in two cruise ships docked in Barcelona harbour.Supporters of independence were already congregating near the parliament hours before a pro-independence rally called for 6 p.m. to coincide with Puigdemont’s speech to the assembly.“We’re very excited, it’s another historic day and we’re hoping they will declare independence,” said Laura Moreno, a 21-year-old literature student, sitting wrapped in a Catalan flag near the parliament.If independence is not declared, she said, “the fight will go on and we’ll try again ... If it doesn’t happen now, it will in the future.”Aitor Llado, 30, walking near the Catalan parliament carrying a Catalan separatist flag, also said it was an historic day. “Today is the day they are going to declare independence and we hope to leave Spain because it’s an oppressor country.”The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Opinion polls conducted before the vote suggested a minority of around 40 percent of residents in Catalonia backed independence.Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports.Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Barcelona against independence at the weekend, waving red-yellow Spanish flags through the city centre.That rally occurred a week after some 900 people were injured when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt a referendum ruled illegal in Madrid.Puigdemont has said he is determined to apply a law passed by the Catalan assembly that called for a declaration of independence within days if Catalans voted “yes” on Oct. 1.Puigdemont could ask the parliament to vote on a motion of independence, which lawmakers say would start a period of up to six months during which Catalonia would write a new constitution and negotiate a divorce with Spain. Or, he could make a statement of intent on a future independence declaration.Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull refused to disclose what Puigdemont would say but told a news conference after the cabinet meeting he would be “clear and explicit” and Tuesday would be an historic day.The Madrid government has said it will respond immediately to any unilateral independence proclamation.Spanish ruling party lawmakers said Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was considering taking the unprecedented step of dissolving the Catalan parliament and triggering new regional elections, the so-called “nuclear option”.The European Commission repeated its call for dialogue in Spain to end the crisis in Catalonia. Puigdemont has also called for talks and international mediation, but Rajoy has said he will not negotiate with the Catalan leaders unless they abandon plans to declare independence."
1442,"LISBON: European champions Portugal qualified for next year’s World Cup with a convincing 2-0 home win over Switzerland on Tuesday, ending their rivals’ perfect record in Group B after an own goal by Johan Djourou set them on their way.With Bernardo Silva giving one of his best performances for his country, the Portuguese did not even need a goal from their captain Cristiano Ronaldo as they pulled level on 27 points with Switzerland and won the group on goal difference.Djourou put the ball through his own net four minutes before halftime and Andre Silva sealed the victory in the 57th minute with his ninth goal of the campaign.The Swiss had led the group since beating Portugal 2-0 in Basel in their opening match in September last year and gone on to win all nine matches before Tuesday’s encounter in Lisbon, while Portugal had won their subsequent eight.Aside from a penalty shootout defeat by Chile at the Confederations Cup in June, the defeat by Switzerland was the only competitive game Portugal have lost since Fernando Santos took over as coach in September 2014.Switzerland will now enter a playoff over two legs with another European group runner-up in November for a place in Russia. The draw for the playoffs will be held next Tuesday.Ronaldo should have scored his 16th goal of the qualifying campaign when he was sent clear in the 78th minute but he over-elaborated as he tried to get around Yann Sommer and allowed the goalkeeper to claim the ball.The Swiss were cool and comfortable for the first half hour, stringing together some neat moves in midfield, while Portugal were let down by poor crossing and struggled to get the ball to Ronaldo.But after Silva had a rasping drive tipped away by Sommer, the hosts moved up a gear and went ahead with the help of some defensive misfortune for the visitors.Eliseu fired in a low cross which Sommer parried, only for the ball to ricochet off Djourou into the net.The hosts took control after the break and scored again with a superbly-worked goal. A quick exchange of passes freed Silva on the right and his low cross was turned in by Andre Silva at the second attempt to send the Estadio da Luz into raptures."
1443,"ATHENS: A mental health emergency is unfolding in migrant camps on Greece’s islands, fueled by poor living conditions, neglect and violence, charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Tuesday.Medical staff have seen a sharp increase in people trying to get help after attempting suicide, harming themselves or suffering psychotic episodes, it said in a report.More than 13,000 migrants and refugees, mostly Syrians and Iraqis fleeing years of war, are living in five camps on Greek islands close to Turkey, government figures show.Four of those camps are holding two to three times as many people as they were designed for.“Every day our teams treat patients who tell us that they would prefer to have died in their country than be trapped here,” said Jayne Grimes, manager of MSF’s mental health activities on the island of Samos.The charity said six or seven new patients had visited its clinic on the nearby island of Lesbos each week over the summer following suicide attempts, self-harm or psychotic episodes, 50 percent more than the previous three months.Violence which many experienced on the journey or in Greece was one factor aggravating mental distress, MSF said.“I know I need to find hope, but when the night falls and I see where I am, I feel like I‘m going crazy,” it quoted a Syrian man as saying.The 25-year-old said he was haunted by the images of people dying of hunger in front of him in the long-besieged town of Madaya. “I still remember the taste of the leaves and the smell of death,” he said.On Samos, more than 3,000 people are crammed into facilities designed to hold 700, and about 400 live in the woods. In one Lesbos camp, about 1,500 people are in makeshift shelters or tents without flooring or heating, the U.N. refugee agency says.In August, MSF found nearly three-quarters of new mental health patients on Lesbos needed to be referred to a psychiatrist, up from just over a third in the nine months from October 2016 to June 2017.The report quoted a 41-year-old man, who said he had been tortured in a Syrian prison. When he visited a Lesbos hospital, he said he was told he would have to wait eight months to see a psychiatrist. “When I heard that, I felt like dying,” he said.A 29-year-old Syrian woman, on Lesbos with her family, told the MSF researchers the uncertainty over the future was “crushing us. It is killing us inside.”While the number of arrivals to Greece has slowed significantly since a European Union deal with Turkey to block the route in March last year, a recent sharp rise in arrivals has put pressure on government-run facilities."
1444,"LONDON: London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Tuesday, announced his plans to visit India and Pakistan.He expressed that democracy is the only way forward for Pakistan.The London Mayor said he was on a mission to drum up trade links between the capital and the two subcontinent countries.Khan is due to meet not only politicians and business leaders but also figures in the film industries as well as representatives of the sports, tech and education sectors during his six-day visit to six cities towards the end of this year.According to his office, Mr Khan would be the first Mayor of London to visit India and Pakistan in a single trip, as well as the first major British politician to carry out a trade mission to both countries in recent times.Responding to a question regarding people buying properties in the UK, he said, these issues are for the Pakistani courts and the British Government to settle. But of course living in a democracy, judges can hold the executive accountable if there is any wrongdoing, he said.Sadiq Khan said, in Pakistan, democracy is the only solution. He said, there are challenges but democracy gives people opportunities and influences who governs us.Sadiq Khan said bilateral trade between the UK and Pakistan is valued at £2bn and in 2015 five Pakistanis companies were listed on the London Stock Exchange with a combined market value of £10.5bn. He said he was deliberately going Pakistan and India because British politicians go either to Pakistan or India and if they go to Pakistan they only go to Islamabad but “we will set a record”.He said, “in Pakistan, I will go to Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi. Lahore is the cultural capital, Islamabad is the political capital and Karachi is the commercial capital of Pakistan, and I will go all these places."" The London Mayor said, ""We will go to six cities in six days in India and Pakistan, we will not be sleeping. I want to send the message to Pakistan and India that London is open for talent, business and friendships.”Only two cities in the world provide more investment in Pakistan than London, and 44% of the fastest growing Indian companies now have a base in London.Khan said, ""As someone whose grandparents were born in India, and whose parents moved to London from Pakistan, I feel a deep affinity for the subcontinent.""""But what excites me most about this trip is that I know it can deliver real benefits for Londoners — benefits in terms of business and trade, jobs and investment, and in terms of cultural and technological exchange,"" he added.""This is a really important mission as there are so many areas in which London can work with its counterparts across India and Pakistan, not only in business but in tackling some of the biggest challenges we all face - such as air pollution and climate change.""""I am passionate about showing that my city will always be open to engaging with partners from around the world, and I look forward to strengthening the bonds between London and our friends in India and Pakistan later this year,"" said the London Mayor.Accompanied by his deputy mayor for business, Rajesh Agrawal, Sadiq Khan is due to visit Mumbai, Delhi and Amritsar in India, before heading to Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi in Pakistan."
1445,"Griezmann opened the scoring and then set up Olivier Giroud before the break while Belarus reduced the arrears on the stroke of halftime through Anton Saroka.The result put France, who will take part in their sixth consecutive World Cup finals, on 23 points after 10 games, four ahead of second-placed Sweden.Four days after a decisive 1-0 win in Bulgaria, Didier Deschamps’s team were never really under pressure and avoided having to go through the playoffs, as they had to reach the 2010 and 2014 finals.“We did the job, our goal was to qualify first in our group,” France coach Didier Deschamps told a news conference.Belarus boss Igor Kriushenko said the hosts controlled the game.“They had speed and they were very careful at the back,” he added.Deschamps switched from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 formation with Giroud and Griezmann up front, pushing Kylian Mbappe and Alexandre Lacazette onto the bench.France were the early aggressors but Belarus had the first clear chance when Yuri Kovalev’s low angled shot whizzed just past Hugo Lloris’s right-hand post in the 12th minute.The hosts went close in the 18th when Rafael Varane’s point-blank header was tipped over the bar by Sergei Chernik.Kingsley Coman was a constant menace on the right flank and his fine cross in the 21st minute was met by Giroud, whose header crashed onto the bar.The hosts were rewarded for their efforts six minutes later, however, when Griezmann beat Chernik from close range after a Blaise Matuidi through ball tore the Belarus defence wide open.They doubled their tally six minutes later as another through ball, this time from Griezmann, was collected by Giroud in the area and the Arsenal forward clinically slid it past Chernik.It was Giroud’s 28th goal for France.France’s concentration levels dipped, however, and they were punished on the stroke of halftime when Saroka’s cool finish allowed the visitors to grab a route back into the game.Yet France maintained control in the second half as Mbappe came on as a substitute for Coman, but made little impact.Belarus threatened on the break and Deschamps, sensing danger, replaced Griezmann with the more defensive Moussa Sissoko.From then on, the hosts were just content to keep their foot on the ball and look to hit their opponents on the break."
1446,"Olivier Giroud’s scorpion kick strike for Arsenal against Crystal Palace last season was shortlisted for FIFA’s goal of the year award on Monday, alongside efforts from Venezuelan teenager Deyna Castellanos and goalkeeper Oscarine Masuluke.Giroud scored with an improvised volley in the Premier League match on Jan. 1, producing an acrobatic flick with his left heel to convert Alexis Sanchez’s cross into the net off the crossbar while tumbling forward.Arsenal won the match 2-0 and Giroud, who admitted afterwards that he had a bit of luck with his connection, said it was the best goal he had ever scored.The 31-year-old is the seventh Frenchman to be nominated for the award but the first to make the final shortlist of three, world soccer’s governing body said on its website. Castellanos is the second Venezuelan woman in successive years to make the final three and was nominated for her strike from the halfway line against Cameroon at the U-17 Women’s World Cup in Jordan last year.The 18-year-old follows in the footsteps of compatriot Daniuska Rodriguez, whose goal made the final three for last year’s award but lost out to Malaysian Mohd Faiz Subri’s spectacular 35-metre, swerving free-kick.South Africa’s Masuluke is the first goalkeeper as well as the first player from Africa to make it to the final three for his last minute bicycle-kick equaliser for Baroka FC against Orlando Pirates last year.The winner of the award, named after the late Hungary captain Ferenc Puskas, will be decided by the public and announced at FIFA’s annual player of the year ceremony in London on Oct. 23."

Of course it is not the positive thing, because it's better don't have injuries.""But at the same time the injuries, the only positive thing about injury is when you come back and when you have success, you appreciate it even much more.""Nadal, a 16-time Grand Slam winner who has suffered with knee problems for several years, plays unseeded American Jared Donaldson in his opener in Shanghai. The final is on Sunday.He said on the eve of the match that he has learnt to adapt his playing style as he reaches the climax of one of the great tennis careers.""Of course the essence of my game... is probably the same, but during the years and during your career, I always say the same, of course you lose things.""On your way you lose things that you have when you are younger, so you need to act on other things to keep being competitive."""

We call on the Catalan government to take all necessary measures to make possible and fully effective this declaration of independence and the measures contained in the transition law that founds the republic.”Puigdemont told the assembly earlier that the effects of the declaration would be suspended to allow time for talks to reach a negotiated solution to the standoff over the northeastern region.

Amblin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The deal is the first to be made public since Apple hired veteran Sony executives Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg in June to expand the iPhone maker’s push into original programming, a field crowded with streaming services and traditional networks.It is unclear how people will be able to watch “Amazing Stories” or when it will debut. Apple has not divulged if it will put its own TV series in the iTunes Store, where it sells shows made by other companies, or on another platform.The deal with Spielberg fits with a strategy Apple executives have outlined in meetings with Hollywood executives. Apple has emphasized in the discussions that it wants prestigious programming and to work with A-list actors, producers and writers, according to sources with knowledge of Apple’s plans.The company already has placed bids on other projects, including for a comedy series about morning television starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, sources said.“They are looking for really high-end premium stuff they feel is creatively in line with the Apple brand,” one source said of Apple’s strategy.The technology company is competing with several established players that have hooked big name stars, such as Netflix Inc and Time Warner Inc’s HBO, plus newer entrants like Facebook Inc FB.N.Apple has committed $1 billion to start its programming push, the sources said.

1453,"Although the name of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, emir of the Hizb-e-Islami group, has been dropped from the list of blacklisted individuals by the United Nations' Security Council, uncertainty still prevails and chances of peace in Afghanistan are bleak because of several reasons, including divisions at the local, national, and international level which are yet to be overcome.The kind of international support shown by the developments today is likely to increase the worth of President Ashraf Ghani and his coalition government, which was not taken seriously by the local rival groups and the international community.It was a general perception that the Ghani government was not capable or independent enough to decide about the peace and stability related problems because of its dependence on foreign support for survival. The government had to consider the interests of the allies, both local and international, before proceeding in any direction.An ethnic Pashtun, Ghani has been jointly running the government with the Persian runner-up in the 2014 presidential election, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Ghani had agreed to a national unity deal and now the two are ruling the country as coalition partners. Those familiar with governance issues in Kabul, were well aware that this Pashto-Persian coalition government was also one of the biggest hurdles in the settlement of disputes with the Pashtun-dominated groups of the Taliban and Hizb-e-Islami (Hekmatyar).""The reconciliation process will take time to complete in Afghanistan,"" said Najam Burhani, a renowned Afghan journalist who has a thorough understanding of affairs in Kabul.""There are three major reasons which may further deteriorate the situation. First of all, the Afghan government needs to improve its authority and confidence level to satisfy opposing groups. The Afghan government's dependency on foreign and local allies has reduced its value for the Taliban and Hizb-e-Islami,"" he explained.The war between Pakistan and India in Afghanistan also needs to be stopped without further destruction, he said.""But only a regional ceasefire is not enough as world powers, particularly the US and Russia's interests, are also restricting Afghanistan from reaching a better conclusion,"" he said.Also read: UN lifts sanctions on Afghan warlord Gulbuddin HekmatyarBurhani was not too excited about the new development regarding Gulbadin Hekmatyar, saying members of the group were already present in the government and even part of the peace process in Afghanistan.A recent report released two days ago says the growing presence of Daesh and Taliban in almost half of the country has shocked those eying a better tomorrow. The report clearly indicates that currently 50 districts, or almost half of the country, are under the influence of the Taliban or Daesh. It also mentions that the Taliban have imposed Shariah or an Islamic way of life in these areas.""In this whole scenario, Pakistan has the responsibility to assert for peace and play a positive role in Afghanistan to trim-down a serious trust deficit with its immediate neighbor,"" Shamim Shahid, a Peshawar-based senior journalist and expert on Afghan affairs, said while talking to Geo News.It is the right time, he maintained, for us to go away from the wars in Afghanistan and win the hearts and minds of Afghans.""This will increase the Afghans' dependency on Pakistan and we can take long term benefit from the situation. This is the only solution for Pakistan to get rid of the implications of terrorism in Afghanistan,"" he said.Speaking to Geo News through telephone from Kabul, Sharafat – Hekmatyar's trusted man in Pakistan, was optimistic about the change in the situation and said that, after the removal of Hekmatyar's name from the black-list, they now expect the release of almost 80 arrested members of the group.""Iran and India had been pressing Russia to push against removal of Hekmatyar's name from the list. Indians had assumed that bringing Hekmatyar back to Kabul would serve the Pakistani interest. We made it possible through negotiations with former superpower Russia while contacts with the French government were also made,"" he said.Afghan Taliban spokesman, Zabeehullah Mujahid, however, declined to accept that they were part of talks with the Ghani-led Afghan government.""We can only negotiate the aggressors' withdrawal from Afghanistan and our political office is available for this purpose,"" said the Taliban spokesman replying to a written question about their engagement in peace talks with the Afghan government.""It will take time to bring peace back to Afghanistan. The superpowers, neighbours, and local political and militant groups are fighting to benefit from the situation,"" said senior journalist Saleem Safi responding to a question regarding the possible solution of the Afghan crisis.""Internal Afghan political groups, Iran, India and the world powers are opposing Hekmatyar's return,"" he said."

Although they had finished last, let’s not forget they had bagged the Fair Play trophy nevertheless.Following last year’s PSL, the Lahore Qalandars management made some big and bold decisions. Notably, it took on board Mudassar Nazar as advisor. Nazar, who played 76 Tests and 122 ODIs for Pakistan, has served as the national team’s coach and was also associated with the ICC Global Cricket Academy.Qalandars also appointed Aaqib Javed as director. The 44-year-old Javed, who played 22 Tests and 163 ODIs for Pakistan and was part of the 1992 World Cup winning side, called in New Zealand star Brendon McCullum to replace Azhar Ali as captain. The appointment of McCullum, a former Black Caps captain who has smashed two centuries in 71 T20Is, to Lahore Qalandars was hailed by all.Team owner Fawad Rana called McCullum’s addition to Qalandars “big news” and expressed hope that this would prove to be the first step in the team’s journey to success.Lahore Qalandars’ 20-member squad comprises seven foreign players, including former Black Caps all-rounder James Franklin, West Indies’ Sunil Narine, England opener Jason Roy who are renowned for their expertise in the T20 format of the game.Pakistan pacer Sohail Tanvir, who represented Karachi Kings in last year’s edition, will be seen in action in Lahore Qalandars’ colours this time. The 32-year-old, who won the best bowler award in IPL 2008, is the fourth Pakistani bowler to bag 50 wickets in T20I.Leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who missed out on representing Lahore Qalandars in last year’s PSL due to a doping ban, is available this time.Umar Akmal, who won the best batsman award in last year’s edition for smashing 335 runs along with four half-centuries in the eight matches, is ready to make life difficult for rival bowlers this time as well.Lahore Qalandars will play their first match of PSL 2017 on February 10 against Quetta Gladiators.Qalandars CEO Rana Atif is full of optimism ahead of the contest. “Whatever happened in the last edition is in the past now,” he said. “All you Lahore fans, get ready!

1456,"WASHINGTON/DAMASCUS: US President Donald Trump on Saturday denounced a judge who lifted the travel ban he had imposed on citizens of seven mainly Muslim countries, taking an unusual jab at an independent branch of the US government as he vowed to bring back the restrictions.Trump's personal attack on US District Judge James Robart went too far for some who said he was undermining an institution designed to check the power of the White House and Congress.As the ban lifted, refugees and thousands of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who had been stopped in their tracks last weekend by Trump's executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the United States.The Justice Department on Saturday filed a formal notice that it intends to appeal the ruling made by Robart in Seattle late on Friday. The judge appointed by former Republican President George W. Bush questioned the constitutionality of Trump's order.""The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" Trump said on Twitter early on Saturday. Trump has said ""extreme vetting"" of refugees and immigrants is needed to prevent terrorist attacks.Eight hours later, Trump showed no signs of backing down when he tweeted ""What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into US?""Trump’s tweets criticizing the judge’s decision could undermine the credibility of Justice Department attorneys as they seek to defend the executive order in Washington state and other courts, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University, adding that presidents are usually circumspect about commenting on government litigation.""It’s hard for the President to demand that courts respect his inherent authority when he is disrespecting the inherent authority of the judiciary. That certainly tends to poison the well for litigation,"" Turley said.SEPARATION OF POWERSIt is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the U.S. Constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and Congress.Reached by email, Robart declined comment on Trump's tweets.Democratic Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said Trump went too far by attacking the judge and the integrity of the judicial branch.Iraqi refugee Nizar Kassab and his family pose for pictures with their passports in their temporary home in Beirut, Lebanon February 4, 2017. REUTERS/ Jamal Saidi""He is undermining the entire system of government, not only the decisions with which he disagrees,"" Cardin said in a statement.""Read the 'so-called' Constitution,"" tweeted Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee.In an interview with ABC scheduled to air on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence said he did not think that Trump's criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers.""I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them,"" Pence said, according to an excerpt of the interview.The court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to Trump's push to clamp down on immigration. His order set off chaos last week at airports across the United States where travelers were stranded and thousands of people gathered to protest.Americans are divided over Trump's order. A Reuters/Ipsos poll this week showed 49 percent favored it while 41 percent did not.Wes Parker, a retiree from Long Beach, California, held a sign saying ""Trump is love"" at the Los Angeles International Airport, and said he supported the tighter measures.""We just have to support the travel pause,"" said Parker, 62. ""If you were a new president coming in, wouldn't you want what you feel safe with?""Rights groups, Democrats and U.S. allies have condemned the travel ban as discriminatory. On Saturday, there were protests against the immigrant curb in Washington, New York, Los Angeles and other cities.At the White House, hundreds of protesters chanted ""Donald, Donald can't you see? You're not welcome in D.C.""TRAVELERS MOVE WITH HASTEThe sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would-be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the United States will remain open.In Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Fuad Sharef and his family prepared to fly on Saturday to Istanbul and then New York before starting a new life in Nashville, Tennessee.""I am very happy that we are going to travel today. Finally, we made it,"" said Sharef, who was stopped from boarding a New York-bound flight last week.The Department of Homeland Security said on Saturday it would return to its normal procedures for screening travelers but that the Justice Department would file for an emergency stay of the order ""at the earliest possible time.""Some travelers told Reuters they were cautious about the sudden change.""I will not say if I have hope or not. I wait, watch and then I build my hopes,"" said Josephine Abu Assaleh, 60, who was stopped from entering the United States after landing in Philadelphia last week with five members of her family.""We left the matter with the lawyers. When they tell us the decision has been canceled, we will decide whether to go back or not,"" she told Reuters in Damascus, speaking by telephone.Virtually all refugees also were barred by Trump's order, upending the lives of thousands of people who have spent years seeking asylum in the United States.Friday night's court decision sent refugee advocacy and resettlement agencies scrambling to help people in the pipeline.Iraqi refugee Nizar al-Qassab, 52, told Reuters in Lebanon that his family had been due to travel to the United States for resettlement on Jan. 31. The trip was canceled two days before that and he was now waiting for a phone call from U.N. officials overseeing their case.""It's in God's hands,"" he said. "
1457,"DUBAI: A Revolutionary Guards commander said Iran would use its missiles if its security is under threat, as the elite force defied new US sanctions on its missile programme by holding a military exercise on Saturday.Tensions between Tehran and Washington have risen since a recent Iranian ballistic missile test which prompted U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to impose sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the Revolutionary Guards.Trump's national security adviser Michael Flynn said the Washington was putting Iran on notice over its ""destabilising activity"", and Trump tweeted Tehran was ""playing with fire""""We are working day and night to protect Iran’s security,"" head of Revolutionary Guards' aerospace unit, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hajizadeh was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency.""If we see smallest misstep from the enemies, our roaring missiles will fall on their heads,"" he added.Despite the heated words, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Saturday he was not considering raising the number of US forces in the Middle East to address Iran's ""misbehavior"", but warned that the world would not ignore Iranian activities.Iran's Revolutionary Guards is holding the military exercise in Semnan province on Saturday to test missile and radar systems and to ""showcase the power of Iran's revolution and to dismiss the sanctions,"" according to the force's website.Dismissing Trump's comments that ""nothing is off the table"" in dealing with Tehran, the commander of Iran's ground forces said on Saturday that the Islamic Republic has been hearing such threats since its 1979 revolution.""The defence capability and the offensive prowess of Iran's armed forces would make America or any other enemy regretful of any incursion,"" Ahmad Reza Pourdastan was quoted as saying by ISNA.BALLISTIC TESTIranian state news agencies reported that home-made missile systems, radars, command and control centres, and cyber warfare systems would be tested in Saturday's drill.Iran has one of the Middle East's largest missile programmes and held a similar exercise in December to showcase its defence systems, including radars, anti-missile defence units, and short and medium-range missiles.Tehran confirmed on Wednesday that it had test-fired a new ballistic missile, but said the test did not breach the Islamic Republic's nuclear agreement with world powers or a U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing the pact.Iran has test-fired several ballistic missiles since the nuclear deal in 2015, but the latest test was the first since Trump entered the White House. Trump said during his election campaign that he would stop Iran's missile programme.The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on Tuesday and recommended the missile testing be studied at committee level. The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called the test ""unacceptable"".The Security Council resolution was adopted to buttress the deal under which Iran curbed its nuclear activities to allay concerns they could be used to develop atomic bombs, in exchange for relief from economic sanctions.The resolution urged Tehran to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Critics say the resolution's language does not make this obligatory. "

1459,"JOHANNESBURG: Cricket South Africa on Saturday announced plans for a Twenty20 league which it hopes will attract major international investment and big-name players.The #T20 Global League appears to be based on the successful Indian Premier League and Australia´s Big Bash League, although there were limited details about the structure of the tournament.Eight franchises will be sold and the teams are expected to be city-based, with the tournament being played in late 2017, when all South Africa´s leading players and many world stars are likely to be available.A tender has been issued with a deadline of March 3 for expressions of interest.""We are confident that the window we have chosen will make it possible for franchises to attract top-class players to South Africa,"" said CSA chief executive Haroon Lorgat.Plans for the league were revealed to International Cricket Council member countries during ICC meetings in Dubai which ended on Friday.""Our vision is to drive the creation of a new T20 destination league in South Africa that would energise the sport of cricket in South Africa by creating a global platform for the best-in-class to perform and showcase their talent to a global audience,"" said CSA president Chris Nenzani.""We have received a very favourable response to our plans from the ICC and member boards and look to their support."""
1460,"LONDON: The International Cricket Council has moved closer to a radical shake-up to pave the way for Afghanistan and Ireland to become Test nations and restrict the power of the ´Big Three´ of India, England and Australia.Following a meeting at its Dubai headquarters, cricket´s global governing body said Saturday it had reached ""agreement in principle to constitutional and financial change, further progress on future international cricket structures and agreement around the consistent use of DRS (the Decision Review System).""Among key proposals are that the top nine Test-playing countries will compete among themselves in a rolling two-year league and against the three lower-ranked teams.Those three would comprise Zimbabwe, with Ireland and Afghanistan also in line to become full or Test members provided, the ICC said, they met ""membership criteria"".Meanwhile a 13-team one-day international league would be run over a three-year period leading into qualification for the 2023 World Cup.Plans are also in place for a regional Twenty20 competition structure to be developed as a pathway to qualification for the ICC World T20.The ICC statement said: ""A scheduling summit will now be held in March before a detailed proposal is put to the ICC board in April.""The aim is to provide greater ""context"" for bilateral matches and ICC chief executive David Richardson added: ""The ICC chief executives´ committee has explored a whole range of solutions to the future structure of bilateral cricket ranging from the status quo to two tier leagues and every possible option in-between.""The former South Africa wicket-keeper added: ""The model the group has agreed on enables us to provide context for all three formats of the game and in the case of the ODI and T20 solutions the approach goes beyond the full members and aligns bilateral cricket with qualification for ICC events.""Promoting equalityIn 2014, control of the ICC was effectively ceded to the ´Big Three´ with many observers arguing they took too large a share of the game´s global revenue.But under the guidance of India´s Shashank Manohar, the current ICC chairman, the governing body has been trying to curb the power of the ´Big Three´.The ICC said the ""broader principles"" that have been agreed included a ""revised financial distribution ensuring a more equitable distribution of revenues"" and the ""equal weight of votes for all board members regardless of membership status"".""Today was an important step forward for the future of the ICC and cricket around the world,"" said Manohar.""The proposals from the working group to reverse the resolutions of 2014 and deliver a revised constitution and financial model were accepted by the ICC board and now we will work collectively to refine the detail for final sign-off in April.""I want the ICC to be reasonable and fair in our approach to all 105 Members and the revised constitution and financial model does that,"" he added.The ICC´s announcement came just days after India´s Supreme Court appointed a top anti-corruption troubleshooter on Monday as head of a team to oversee the Board of Control for Cricket in India -- the financial powerhouse of the global game -- after sacking its top officials for failing to implement reforms.Former government auditor Vinod Rai, who exposed major corruption scandals under the previous government, will head the new committee of administrators to run the Indian board."

1462,"HAMILTON: Trent Boult took career best one-day figures as New Zealand completed a tense 24-run win over Australia in Hamilton on Sunday to regain the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy with a 2-0 series victory.Boult took 6-33 as Australia, who only needed to square the series to retain the trophy, were dismissed for 257 on the final ball of the 47th over as they chased New Zealand´s 281 for nine.The home side´s innings had been built on Ross Taylor´s 16th ODI century with Dean Brownlie adding his maiden half century in his first ODI innings in more than two years.Stand-in captain Aaron Finch (56) and Travis Head (53) had put Australia on track for victory but the visitors lost quick wickets after good partnerships before Boult returned to run through the tail.""I think the collective bowled really well and we managed to take wickets throughout and put pressure on them,"" man-of-the-match Boult said.""It was a good series and great couple of games and we´re happy to have (the trophy) back.""New Zealand won the first game at Eden Park by six runs but the second in Napier on Thursday was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to an unsafe, wet outfield.Marcus Stoinis, whose 146 not out in the first game almost singlehandedly clinched victory for Australia, looked like being the key wicket again on Sunday when he was well set on 42 with his side 198-6 in the 40th over.The 27-year-old, however, did not quite get hold of a flighted delivery from left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner and holed out to Jimmy Neesham at long on.Pat Cummins (27) and Mitchell Starc (29 not out) threatened to get the visitors home with a 51-run partnership in five overs before Boult struck with three wickets.""Australia showed why they are number one in the world,"" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said.""We felt like we had them under pressure but they kept coming at us.So credit to our guys to soaking up that pressure and taking the games deep and coming out the other side.""Earlier, Taylor´s 107 and Brownlie´s 63 laid the foundation for New Zealand´s innings but the latter´s dismissal sparked a middle order collapse and the hosts slumped to 209-6 in the 41st over.Santner then provided a valuable 38 runs including two fours and a six to end the 50th and final over, which started with Starc taking two wickets from the first two balls.""We felt that it was a target we could chase down,"" Finch said.""While we had a couple of guys get 50s, they don´t win games at this level."
1463,"NEW YORK: From London and Paris to New York and Washington, thousands of people took to the streets Saturday in American and European cities to protest US President Donald Trump's travel ban amid a fierce legal battle over the order.The biggest demonstration by far took place in the British capital, where an estimated 10,000 people turned out, chanting ""Theresa May: Shame on You"" to denounce the British prime minister's support for the new US leader.Brandishing placards declaring ""No to scapegoating Muslims"" and ""Socialism not Trumpism,"" the protesters moved from the US embassy toward May's Downing Street office.In an executive order issued on January 27, Trump slapped a blanket ban on nationals of seven mainly Muslim countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen -- barring their entry to the United States for 90 days.Refugees were also barred from entry for 120 days, except those from Syria, who were blocked indefinitely.On Friday, a US federal judge suspended the ban, a move which the Republican president -- who took office on January 20 -- condemned and vowed to fight.Late Saturday, the Justice Department filed its motion to appeal the judge's order, though the legal brief detailing its arguments has yet to come.""We'll win. For the safety of the country, we'll win,"" Trump told reporters.'Dump Trump'About 3,000 people demonstrated in New York, Trump's hometown, where protests against the property magnate-turned-world leader take place almost daily.Activists and supporters gathered outside the historic Stonewall Inn, a landmark of the gay rights movement in New York's Greenwich Village, to show support for Muslims and others affected by Trump's immigration order.Democratic Senate minority leader Charles Schumer led the crowd -- which carried rainbow flags and Americans flags -- in cheers of ""Dump Trump.""In Washington, hundreds marched from the White House to Capitol Hill to show their solidarity.""Donald, Donald can't you see, we don't want you in DC,"" chanted the demonstrators in the largely Democratic-leaning US capital.Many waved homemade signs with slogans like ""Love knows no borders"" and ""Will swap Trump for 1,000 refugees.""""I was born and raised here, and for the first time in my life, I don't feel safe,"" said Abu Bakkar, 26, whose parents are originally from Pakistan.The Department of Defense consultant said the new president ""has revealed hate that's been underground for so long.

1466,"Lionel Messi and Argentina will be fighting for their World Cup lives here Tuesday as the South American heavyweights take on Ecuador aiming to avoid a humiliating failure to qualify for next year's finals in Russia.The eyes of the football world will turn to Quito's Estadio Olimpico Atahualpa to see if the once unthinkable prospect of a World Cup without Messi is to become a stunning reality.The two-time World Cup winners head into the final round of South American qualifiers in sixth place, outside the top four positions which grant automatic qualification and trailing fifth-placed Peru, who occupy the playoff spot, on goal difference.Yet with only two points separating third-placed Chile (26 points) from seventh-placed Paraguay (24), any number of permutations are possible.Argentina can simplify the equation for their nervous fans, however, if they manage to take all three points in Quito when the action kicks off at 6:30pm local time (2330 GMT).A victory would guarantee they finish no worse than fifth place, putting them into a two-legged play-off against New Zealand they would be expected to win.But winning in the thin air of Quito, which is 2,850 metres (9,350 feet) above sea level, may be easier said than done.The Argentinians have an abysmal record in away games against Ecuador, with their last victory in Quito coming in 2001.Since then in World Cup qualifying games, they have been beaten twice, in 2005 and 2009, before scraping a 1-1 draw in 2013.Barcelona star Messi also has a record of struggling in games at altitude, vomiting on the pitch during a draw in the rarefied air of Bolivia four years ago.The 30-year-old five-time Ballon D'Or winner also heads into the game knowing that next year's finals in Russia may be his final chance to emulate Diego Maradona by winning a World Cup.The 2014 World Cup finalists face their moment of truth after a series of uninspiring performances that has the sporting world scratching its head at how a squad bristling with so much attacking talent has found scoring so difficult.Despite being able to call upon Messi, Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain, Paulo Dybala, Mauro Icardi and Angel Di Maria throughout the campaign, Argentina have only scored 16 times in 17 games.Last Thursday's 0-0 stalemate with Peru in Buenos Aires was Argentina's third consecutive draw. The Albiceleste have now scored only once in their past four qualifying games.Beleaguered coach Jorge Sampaoli -- the third of the qualifying campaign -- has called on his players to follow Messi's example.""If everyone is at Messi's level against Ecuador, we will qualify,"" he said on Monday. ""I have a lot of hope.""For some Argentines, the troubles of the national team have been a long time coming. Sergio Batista, a member of the 1986 World Cup-winning team, was scathing in his assessment.""Argentina is all at sea. But this didn't happen recently. It's the end of a movie I've been watching for 10 years,"" Batista said.""I believe in projects and planning, but in our football, there's nothing. Seven managers in 10 years? And three in a single qualifying campaign? It wouldn't happen anywhere else.""Elsewhere on Tuesday, Chile could seal their qualification with victory over Brazil in Sao Paulo. Brazil have already qualified for the finals and are guaranteed top spot.Uruguay meanwhile need only take a point in their home qualifier against already-eliminated Bolivia to be certain of progressing.One of the most high-stakes games comes in Lima, where Peru will aim to qualify for their first World Cup finals since 1982 when they take on Colombia."

1469,"BERLIN: Volkswagen will make its three mass-market brands more distinct to reduce overlaps and defuse tensions within the carmaking group, its chief executive said on Thursday.The German company is striving to make savings and become more efficient to help fund a costly shift to electric vehicles in the wake of its diesel emissions scandal.CEO Matthias Mueller said the automaker’s executive board had set out a new focus for its mass-market VW, Skoda and Seat brands based on 14 customer groups in its core European market.“The key challenge is [to achieve] a perfect market coverage with clear territories for the brands,” he told a strategy meeting of about 400 managers in Wolfsburg.“We must now be able to better use the synergies that our unique alliance of brands offer than we have done to date.”The move may help to smooth relations between the brands.VW sources told Reuters last week that managers and unions were seeking to curb competition from lower-cost stablemate Skoda, move some of its production to Germany and make the Czech brand pay more for shared technology.That sparked a backlash at Skoda. Concerned about the possibility of losing work to Germany, the Czech brand’s main union threatened to cut back on overtime work. Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka also demanded talks on the issue with Skoda’s leadership.The positioning of the brands is “an emotional theme that recently made waves,” Mueller said.“Of course, it is an extreme challenge sometimes to steer this tanker and to balance the (different) interests,” he added.In a next step, Volkswagen will pursue greater differentiation between its premium brands and expand the strategy to other regions, Mueller said, without being more specific.Separately, Mueller said the group expected to make major savings in development costs at premium brands Audi and Porsche through their new shared PPE production platform for electric cars.“On balance we expect 30 percent less workload” compared with the current MLB and MSB platforms operated separately by Audi and Porsche, the CEO said, without being more specific."

In response, Washington halted issuing non-immigrant visas from its missions in Turkey, prompting Ankara to hit back with a tit-for-tat move.Appearing to have no regrets despite the row, Erdogan said Turkey was ""fully behind its decision"" on the visa suspensions.Although Turkish officials blamed the ambassador for the spat, the State Department said Bass had been operating with the full authority of the US government. Bass is due to leave Turkey at the weekend after he was named the US envoy to Afghanistan earlier this year.""If the giant America is ruled by an ambassador in Ankara, what a shame,"" Erdogan said.On Monday, Turkish prosecutors summoned another local employee working at the US consulate in Istanbul. Erdogan on Thursday claimed that he was hiding in the consulate, but Bass had denied this the day before, telling reporters: ""No one´s hiding at any of our facilities.""Turkish authorities this week detained his wife, his son and his daughter.Turkish Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said the man currently in police custody made a request the day before to see his lawyer and would meet with them on Friday.""There had been no request until yesterday (Wednesday),"" he said. Erdogan said the US response to the arrest of the consulate employee was ""unfair"" and ""disproportionate"", and urged for common sense.Ankara wanted to open a new page in relations with the US under Trump but a spate of issues have raised tensions, including the US refusal to extradite Gulen and American support for Kurdish militias in Syria.Erdogan said that Turkish police forces would no longer use guns made by US-based arms manufacturer Sig Sauer and would ""take steps"" towards using Turkish-produced weapons instead.""From now on our police department ... will not and should not use Sig Sauer weapons,"" he said.Last month, the US government froze arms sales to Erdogan´s bodyguards after Turkish security officials clashed with Kurdish protesters in May following a meeting between Erdogan and President Donald Trump.The move blocks a deal with Sig Sauer for $1.2 million (1.1 million euros) worth of small arms."
1472,"WASHINGTON: She was a small-town American woman yearning to explore. He once married a Guantanamo inmate´s sister.Together they backpacked into war-ravaged Afghanistan, were taken hostage, and bore three children in captivity before their shock rescue.Caitlan Coleman and her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle's ordeal has remained largely a mystery and one of the strangest hostage dramas since the day they were snatched by a Taliban-affiliated group in 2012 and spirited away to a hideout in Pakistan´s semi-autonomous tribal belt.Five years after their capture, during which a 2016 hostage video showed Coleman pleading for an end to ""the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves,"" the family is free, according to statements Thursday by the Pakistani military and the White House.But little is known of the couple's reasons for striking out to Central Asia in the first place, with seemingly no end game in focus.""Only God knows exactly where it will lead or what all can be accomplished, seen, experienced or learned while we travel,"" Caitlan wrote in an email in July 2012 on the eve of her departure, according to Caitlan's neighbor Holly Otterbein, who wrote an article for Philadelphia magazine last year.""So we put ourselves in His hands.""Their adventures took them to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan, where they befriended locals in the countryside and joined caravans with other travelers. They sent postcards home chronicling their adventures.But they reportedly did not tell their parents they were going into Afghanistan.Coleman grew up in the tiny community of Stewartstown, Pennsylvania. She is described by friends as soft-spoken, individualistic, an all-American sweetheart.In September 2012, one month before her capture, she wrote to friends to describe her joy in ""getting to know some of the most unique, quirky people I have ever met, and learning from them. It really gives you a different perspective on the world.""Boyle was raised in Ottawa. They met as teenagers online, shared a passion for science fiction and the Star Wars movies, and got married in 2011 during a trip to Central America, according to Canadian press reports.""How did a self-described 'pacifist Mennonite hippy-child' from rural Canada end up as a prisoner of the most brutal terrorist group in Central Asia? Not even his family is sure,"" Boyle's friend Alex Edwards wrote in a blog post in 2015.""He was a rebel, an iconoclast, a Robin Hood. I hope he still is.""Boyle was drawn to politics, extremist personalities, and justice issues surrounding the detentions in Guantanamo, according to Edwards.He closely followed the case of Canadian-born Omar Khadr, who at age 15 was taken to Afghanistan by his father, an associate of Osama bin-Laden. Khadr was captured in battle and detained for a decade in the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay. He was repatriated to Canada in 2012.During Khadr's detention, Boyle grew close with his sister Zaynab Khadr, herself a controversial figure who once defended the 9/11 attacks on the United States.They married in 2009 but divorced about a year later. Even so, the ties between the son of a Canadian judge and a woman with extremist sympathies stirred controversy.Boyle's parents were given occasional glimpses of their son's and daughter-in-law's life in captivity, in correspondence delivered through intermediaries.Boyle recounts in one letter how he helped deliver his second son in the darkness, with a flashlight between his teeth.""Ta-da!"" he wrote his parents, according to a September 2016 report in the Toronto Star. ""The astonished captors were good and brought all our post-partum needs, so he is now fat and healthy, praise God.""In two videos from last December and January that the hostages' families shared this year, the couple's two sons appear healthy but disheveled. Caitlan's smile has disappeared, her wavy brown hear covered by a black headscarf.According to the Toronto Star, Boyle called his parents on Thursday to say they had been rescued, that their third child, a girl, was born two months ago, and that plans were underway for their return to North America, ending the most agonizing journey of their lives."
1473,"NEW DELHI: A young Indian woman has proved in court she was illegally married off as a minor after submitting evidence from her husband's Facebook page, a child rights activist said Thursday.Sushila Bishnoi, 19, appealed to a court in Rajasthan state to dissolve her underage marriage, an illegal but rife tradition in many parts of rural India.But her husband denied the couple were ever betrothed, threatening to scuttle her case.The teenager, aided by an activist, trawled her husband´s Facebook accounts until they found the smoking gun that proved their marriage occurred when she was underage.""Many of his friends had posted congratulatory messages on his Facebook page,"" said Kriti Bharti, an activist whose Sarathi Trust charity has annulled many child marriages in Rajasthan.""The court accepted the evidence and declared the marriage invalid,"" she said of the ruling Monday.The couple were married in a secret wedding ceremony in Barmer district in 2010 when both were just 12 years old.Girls married off in Rajasthan often remain with their parents after the wedding ceremony until reaching 18 years of age, when they are sent to live their husbands.Bishnoi said her parents were forcing her to move to her husband´s house and consummate the marriage.""I wanted to study but my family and my in-laws wanted me to live with a drunkard,"" Bishnoi told AFP.""It was about life and death, and I chose to live.""She ran away from home to a shelter where she met Bharti, who helped her begin legal proceedings to dissolve the union.India´s highest court Wednesday declared sex with a minor akin to rape even if the couple was married, a landmark ruling that closed a legal loophole around child marriage.Nearly half of all girls in South Asia marry before 18 years of age, according to a UNICEF report released in 2014. "
1474,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Thursday said the recent statement by Captain (retd) Safdar was pointless and no one in the ruling party agrees with his point of view.In an interview on Thursday, PM Abbasi said, ""Neither Nawaz Sharif nor the party or I am responsible for what Capt (retd) Safdar said [in the assembly].""The premier said he would inquire from the son-in-law of the ousted prime minister with whose permission he made the statement.""I must tell Safdar to refrain from provocative statements. As the son-in-law of Nawaz Sharif, he has a lot of responsibility on his shoulders.""The prime minister said Safdar does not represent the government's policy and he will have to furnish an explanation.He further said that any measure which causes instability in the country is deemed as a conspiracy.Abbasi said the July 28 verdict, in which the Supreme Court disqualified Nawaz Sharif as the prime minister, should be left to history, for it will better judge the decision.Speaking about the finance minister, he said Ishaq Dar used to work up to 16 hours a day, but now he works for 12 hours. ""Dar now spends those 4 hours on the cases made against him,"" he said, terming the finance minister best individual in the assembly.He also denied the rumours of having asked Dar to step down saying reports suggesting so are ""baseless.""Responding to Sheikh Rasheed's accusation against him, the prime minister said only a person, who has his own hands clean, should level an allegation against him.Commenting on economic situation of the country, the PM said challenges are there, however his government is trying to deal with them.""Economic challenges are there, but we will overcome them. There are exports issues as well; we are trying to increase our exports, but the export policy does not get implemented in a day,"" he said, maintaining that after the incumbent government took over the country is in better position.The prime minister also lauded Saad Rafique for bringing railways out of deficit.Speaking of Pakistan International Airlines, he said he admits PIA's failure first of all and maintained the only way to improve the situation of the national flag-carrier is to privatise it."

""It is in my mind to perform well for Pakistan's victories.""Fakhar mentioned that he is returning to international cricket after a long break but he has been playing domestic cricket in Pakistan.Pakistan face Sri Lanka in their first international cricket one day match after almost 4 months since the final of Champions Trophy in London, which was played in June earlier this year.The Man of the Match of that final, Fakhar Zaman believes that he is now more confident after scoring a century in the final and hopes that he will continue that form.Speaking to Geo News, Fakhar said that senior players especially Azhar Ali, Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez always guided him.""Captain Sarfraz Ahmed also supported me to let me play my neutral game,"" he added.The left-handed opener was a part of the Lahore Qalandars side during the 2nd edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), where the former skipper of New Zealand Brendon McCullum led the franchise and appreciated the batting skills of Fakhar Zaman.""It was an honour for me whenever McCullum used to praise my technique during practice and matches,"" said Fakhar. Fakhar says the confidence he gained from playing with McCullum in the Lahore Qalandars side during PSL has helped him to hasten his progression."

1477,"ABU DHABI: The white-ball cricket season is set to kick off Friday after a months-long hiatus following the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy final held back in June in Oval, London.Thursday evening brought with it the trophy exhibiting ceremony of the Pakistan-Sri Lanka One Day International (ODI) series — organised at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.The trophy for the five-match series was unveiled by Sarfraz Ahmed — the captain of the Pakistan cricket team — alongside Sri Lanka's Upul Tharanga.Prior to the ceremony, Ahmed noted that new players have joined the squad, which, in turn, offers renewed energy for better performance in the ODI.""Our one-day team is balanced and our record is quite good. We will have some senior players in the squad [this time] and I hope we play better cricket [this time],"" he said.Understanding the mounting pressure subsequent to losing his first Test series earlier, the captain promised an improved show in the limited-over matches.Ahmed, however, revealed that youngster Imam ul Haq, fast-bowler Usman Shinwari, and middle-order batsman Haris Sohail will not among the playing XI against Sri Lankans.Responding to a question by this correspondent, the stressed captain said the toss is not likely to impact the result, while weather — especially dew — can pose challenges.The Dubai International Cricket Stadium's management usually takes certain measures — including a spray — to minimise the dew's effects. The rest, however, is up to the sportsmen.Once the trophy was unveiled, Sri Lankan captain Tharanga expressed hopes for a decent game without their experienced cricketers Angelo Mathews and Lasith Malinga — the latter of whom was dropped from the ODI squad over fitness-and-form issues.The remaining ODIs are slated for October 16 and 18 (in Abu Dhabi) and October 20 and 23 (Sharjah).Pakistan's playing XI for the first ODI: Sarfraz Ahmed, Fakhar Zaman, Ahmed Shehzad, Babar Azam, Mohammad Hafeez, Shoaib Malik, Imad Wasim, Shahdab Khan, Hasan Ali, Ruman Raees, and Junaid Khan."
1478,"Jose Mourinho’s unbeaten Manchester United face the biggest test yet of their title credentials when they visit Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday -- a fixture that always has a little extra spice.United are second in the Premier League, level on 19 points with neighbours Manchester City, but so far Mourinho’s side have yet to face any of last season’s top five.Six wins from their opening seven games, with 21 goals scored and only two conceded, have raised expectations at Old Trafford, but the coming weeks should give a stronger indication of just how ready United are for a real push for the title.Spurs visit Old Trafford on Oct. 28 and then a week later United travel to Stamford Bridge to take on defending champions Chelsea, Mourinho’s former club.The North West derby has always had an extra edge and even though the lack of local players for both clubs could take away some of the needle from the game, the passion from the stands continues to create a special atmosphere.“Anfield away is the ultimate test, mentally and physically with the intensity,” former United captain Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“There’s obviously less home grown talent but the atmosphere will be brilliant and it is a game which you dare not lose as a player.”Particular focus will be on United’s 75 million pounds ($98 million) Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, who has been in prolific form, scoring in 12 of his last 13 games for club and country.The powerful forward joined United from Everton during the close-season and has been an instant success - but there are still some who question whether he can be just as effective against better opponents.While Lukaku - and United - will want to prove that they are the real deal, Liverpool badly need to kick-start their campaign after a shaky beginning.Juergen Klopp’s side have taken just five points from their last four games, leaving them seven points behind the Manchester clubs.The exciting attacking talent in the team, despite the loss to injury of Sadio Mane who is out for six weeks with a hamstring injury, should test the United defence that has had a relatively comfortable campaign so far.Former Liverpool striker and manager Kenny Dalglish expects Mourinho to protect his defence with a cautious approach, similar to how they played in last season’s 1-1 draw on Merseyside.“Last year, when United came to Liverpool, Jose Mourinho parked the bus. But it wasn’t just the one bus, I think it was a couple of double deckers he put there,” said Dalglish.”I think United will come and set up quite defensively...”I think Jose will try to make sure the pressure is on Liverpool, but the pressure is on everyone when it comes to a game like that.”"
1479,"Bollywood superstar, Kareena Kapoor Khan, thinks her son, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, is the “most gorgeous man in India technically.” The diva said she is enjoying the new phase of life, reported Hindustan Times.Kareena, who made her acting debut in 2000 war film Refugee, said she is learning to balance her time between her career, husband, and how she can look glamorous in track pants.  Talking about motherhood, the actress said she was looking forward to this new phase of life. The new mother said transition to the new role for her has been amazing.  Commenting on a statement made by Kareena’s friend and film-maker, Karan Johar on his talk show, she said she’s not one of those celebrities who have a well-thought out wardrobe to put together looks. The actress said she wears what she is most comfortable in; it could be a dress, a pair of jeans or even a track pant and sweatshirt. Kareena shuns the idea of looking perfect from head to toe at all times, and thinks it is an undue pressure on stars.When asked about how she’s finding juggling between work and home, she said, “I think women love to multitask.” She noted how most women in her family and in-laws have worked after getting married and having kids, and she believes she’s always been able to balance work and personal life and there’s not a big difference now.In response to a question about her beauty regimen, the actress said that she does nothing to take care of her skin and that she has been blessed with good skin because of her genes.Kareena has publicly owned her changed body and has clearly not been afraid of body-shaming that a lot of celebrities have had to face on a regular basis. Discussing the topic, she said she is very confident about how she looks and it’s only natural to put on weight after childbirth. She said she has been following a strict routine that’ll take 2-3 months to get her back into shape but she doesn’t care.The actress said giving birth is the most natural thing ever and “understanding and embracing it is the greatest part of womanhood.”          "

It is regular practice for the management of the Dubai stadium, however, to spray the ground to minimise the dew's effects.After the trophy unveiling, Tharanga expressed hope that the Lankans would play better cricket without the experienced Angelo Mathews and pacer Lasith Malinga.Sri Lanka have dropped Lasith Malinga from the one-day international squad to face Pakistan due to his fitness and form related issues.The remaining ODI matches are in Abu Dhabi (October 16 and 18) and Sharjah (October 20 and 23).

1481,"ISLAMABAD: On the second day of his official visit to Islamabad, State Commissioner for Counter-Terrorism and Security of the Peoples’ Republic of China Cheng Guoping once again reiterated China’s full support to Pakistan in its fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism.“The state commissioner appreciated Pakistan’s support to China on its core issues, and for ensuring the safety and security of Chinese citizens working on various CPEC projects in Pakistan”, Cheng Guoping was quoted in a statement issued by the Foreign Office.The Chinese support to Pakistan’s fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism came when the Chinese dignitary met Adviser to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz at the Foreign Office today. “Pakistan on its part will continue to support China on all its core issues. There is need to maintain the momentum of high-level contacts between the two countries,” Aziz told the state commissioner.Taking cognizance of the fact that “profound changes are taking place both internationally and regionally”, Pakistan stressed that strengthening cooperation between China and Pakistan would serve the fundamental interests of the two countries and help promote regional peace and development.“Both sides agreed on deepening cooperation in existing areas of interest, while exploring new avenues for practical collaboration in line with the vision of leadership of the two countries”, read the statement.Cheng Guoping’s meeting with Aziz came at a time when Beijing bailed out Pakistan at the United Nations blocking a move by the United States and supported by the UK and France. On Tuesday, the US took to the UN Sanctions Committee for banning the alleged mastermind of the Pathankot terrorist attack, the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar.China is the only country among the 15-member 1267 counter-terrorism committee of the UN Security Council which has objected to India's application to list Azhar who is accused of masterminding the Pathankot terror attack, as a global terrorist by the UN.According to reports from New York, the US proposal was finalised after consultations with New Delhi, which had wanted JeM to be designated a terror outfit.  The Chinese action came just before the expiry of the 10-day deadline for any proposal to be adopted or blocked or to be put on hold. The 'hold' remains for six months and can be further extended by three months. During this period, it can be anytime converted into a 'block', thereby, ending the life of the proposal. The visit of Cheng Guoping, to Islamabad is of great significance as it comes immediately after Pakistan put under house arrest the head of Jamaat-ud- Dawa, Hafiz Saeed.Saeed is alleged to be the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack. After the arrest, ISPR had claimed that this move came as the result of a “policy decision”. Pakistan has at the start of the State Commissioner’s visit  appreciated China's position on Pakistan's counter-terrorism strategy and the far-reaching successes achieved by Pakistan, while thanking China for its support to Pakistan's national security and territorial integrity,While several reports spoke of Chinese pressure on Pakistan to arrest Saeed, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang denied these reports saying Beijing supported international cooperation on counter-terrorism with Pakistan, provided it is conducted with Islamabad’s consent.“China supports the independent strategies made by Pakistan on counter-terrorism and engaging in international cooperation on counter-terrorism. China supports the international community in conducting cooperation on that and we maintain that it must be based on mutual respect,” he said.Last Friday, Lu Kang also announced that the Chinese state commissioner for counter-terrorism and security would be visiting Islamabad. Cheng Guoping who arrived for a three day visit , in his meeting with the special assistant , Syed Tariq Fatemi  on Monday said China attaches great importance to its relations with Pakistan, and supports its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity.“He also lauded the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan and its security forces in its fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism, which has also helped maintain regional peace and stability”, Cheng Guoping said according to a statement from the Foreign Office.Cheng Guoping was also appreciative of Pakistan consistent support to China on issues of core interest and lauded the sacrifices rendered by Pakistan and its security forces in its fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism, which has helped maintain regional peace and stability,The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) also came under discussion at the Foreign Office on Monday and in a meeting with Fatemi ,both sides reviewed bilateral economic development and other aspects of the bilateral relationship.“Noting the importance of CPEC for the economic development of Pakistan, the two sides stressed that timely completion of CPEC projects would not only give a boost to Pakistan’s economy, but would also significantly contribute towards regional connectivity, peace and development.Pakistan was fully committed to the timely and effective implementation of all the projects under CPEC”, added the statement.  Some reports have also linked the arrest of Hafiz Saeed with the CPEC saying Beijing was aware of and receptive to tensions between India and Pakistan over this alleged Mumbai attacker.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has clearly told China that it has concerns over the CPEC which passes through Azad Kashmir and told the Chinese at the G20 summit in India that China needs to be “sensitive” to India’s strategic interests, as ‘terror’ is emanating from the region. Originally published in The News"

1486,"For Manal al-Sharif, the self-described ""accidental activist"" who spearheaded the campaign against the ban on female drivers in Saudi Arabia, the time for women to be silent is over.Overjoyed by a royal decree last month allowing women to finally get behind the wheel in the ultra-conservative kingdom, the eloquent 38-year-old has now set her sights on the next battle: abolishing the system of male guardianship.""There is no time for us to be silent anymore,"" Sharif told AFP at the Frankfurt book fair, where she presented the German translation of her bestselling memoir Daring to Drive.""Speak up, that is the only way to bring awareness and change things in Saudi Arabia.""In a country that adheres to strict gender segregation and an austere vision of Islam, the guardianship system requires Saudi women to get permission from a designated male family member on anything from travel to enrolling at university.Like the driving ban, the male guardianship ""has stopped a lot of women from pursuing their dreams"", said Sharif, who has drawn comparisons with the late US civil rights activist Rosa Parks.To show how serious she is about her new campaign, Sharif rolls back her sleeve to reveal a plastic blue bracelet that reads ""I am my own guardian"", alongside a picture of a car.""We are not minors. We are capable of driving our own lives,"" she said, smiling at the pun.In her book, Sharif charts her unexpected journey to rebellion, culminating in her arrest after she filmed herself driving and posted the video on YouTube as part of the ""Woman2Drive"" campaign in 2011.Charged with ""driving while female"", she spent nine days in jail in a case that sparked global uproar.With unflinching honesty, Sharif recounts the hardships she faced growing up in relative poverty in Mecca and the struggles she encountered later on as a divorced single mum.She credits her strict parents with pushing her to excel academically but also expresses anger over the painful female genital mutilation she had to endure as a child and the domestic abuse she suffered at home, as well as at the hands of her first husband.She admits to succumbing to radicalism in her youth, even burning her brother´s Backstreet Boys cassettes in what she calls her ""extremist days"". ""In this book I was very open, I tried to break every single taboo that I could,"" Sharif said.Her top grades eventually led her to become the first female information security specialist at the Saudi national oil company Aramco, where women are allowed to drive within the firm´s compound.But trying to get around outside as a woman ""who had no man in her life"" was a constant battle, forcing her to rely on her brother, colleagues or taxi drivers.One day, after failing to find a ride after a doctor´s appointment, she decided to walk home alone. But a car followed her along the way, leaving her terrified -- and fed up.Emboldened by the Arab Spring sweeping through the region at the time, she decided enough was enough. It was time to drive.""So it was really a personal struggle,"" Sharif said.""It was really from the fear of being helpless in my own country.""The memoir ends before the ban is lifted, but Sharif is more than happy to update the epilogue.""I cried, I was so excited,"" she said about hearing the news of King Salman´s decree.""The first thing I tweeted was ´Saudi Arabia will never the same again´, I call it the new Saudi Arabia for women,"" said Sharif, a prolific social media user.The decree comes into effect next June, and Sharif is already looking forward to getting in the driver´s seat, legally this time.""I think it will be the most liberating thing,"" she said.Her book is due to appear in Arabic in November, and Sharif -- who divides her time between Saudi Arabia and Australia, where her new husband works -- is bracing for the reaction in her home country.""I know the personal price I will pay for speaking up will be high,"" she said.""Women in my country are always told to be quiet,"" she added. ""This has led to so many injustices when it comes to women´s rights.""But the mother-of-two says she has been encouraged by recent changes in the Gulf kingdom.Men and women danced in the streets of Riyadh last month after they were allowed to celebrate the country´s national day together for the first time, and Sharif excitedly talks about the prospect of women being allowed to study engineering soon.The changes, which risk upsetting religious hardliners, come as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is introducing economic and social reforms as part of his ""Vision 2030"" programme aimed at diversifying the kingdom´s oil-dependent economy.And that includes getting more women into the workforce.""So many things are happening right now that people are saying: ´Has Saudi Arabia been hacked?´"" Sharif said with a smile."

1488,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Tuesday passed the much needed Compulsory Blood of the Relatives of Thalassaemia Patient Bill and the National Commission on the Status of Women (Amendment) Bill.The Compulsory Blood of the Relatives of Thalassaemia Patient Bill, 2014 on which discussion in the concerned standing committee was going on for the last over two years, is aimed at taking concrete steps for controlling the spread of hazardous disease of Thalassaemia in the country.The bill moved by Dr. Afzal Pechuho of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) would be implemented in the federal capital on becoming Act of the Parliament. The bill also adopted some minor amendments in the legislation.According to the bill, all clinics, hospital, and centers handling and treating Thalassaemia patients would ensure that blood relatives of these children are all screened for Thalassaemia. “This test is to be made compulsory for siblings, first cousins and uncles and aunts who are blood relatives,” the law said.In this regard, it is compulsory for those blood relatives of Thalassaemia patients who are getting married to get a pre-martial screening to ensure that they do not carry the Thalassaemia trait.The bill says that ante natal tests would be carried out on pregnant women who are known carriers and whose partner is also a carrier of the trait. The prevalence of disease in Pakistan is 3.8% and the country is seeing a large increase in Thalassaemic patients due lack of screening and genetic counseling.The details of the bill say that a recent study in Thalassaemia strongly suggests that due to consanguineous marriages, the genes of disease are trapped within the family. Families with a history of Thalassaemia have a high carrier rate of 30%.The National Commission on the Status of Women (Amendment) bill, 2016 moved by Dr. Nighat Shakeel Khan and others is aimed at giving a time frame to the government to appoint chairperson of the commission.“A vacancy of chairperson shall be filled as provided in this Act within 30 days of the occurrence of the vacancy,” the amendment said. Speaking on the occasion, Minister of State for Health Saira Afzal Tarar and Minister of State for Capital Administration (CAD) Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that Islamabad had taken the lead in executing the historic legislation.Dr. Tariq Fazal said the federal government fully supported the private member bill of the PPP parliamentarian saying the provinces should follow suit.

1490,"Ljubljana: European Union member Slovenia has been suggested as a possible model for Catalonia's efforts to split from Spain, having emerged as an independent nation in 1991 in the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia.Large sections of Slovenia´s media and public opinion have backed Catalonia breaking away. ""Many Slovenian hearts beat for the Catalan people,"" says President Borut Pahor.Slovenia held a referendum in December 1990 after Belgrade refused more autonomy. The vote, which Yugoslavia did not try to prevent, saw 88.2 percent choose independence. Turnout was 95 percent.Fresh talks between Slovenia and Belgrade failed and after Slovenia´s parliament laid the groundwork for breaking away, it declared independence on June 25, 1991 -- the same day as neighbouring Croatia.Yugoslavia´s army mobilised and 62 people were killed in 10 days of violence. EU-sponsored mediation secured on July 7 a truce, a military withdrawal and an agreement to halt independence efforts for three months.Afterwards, Slovenia introduced its own currency and adopted a national constitution in December. Beset by multiple crises, Belgrade acquiesced. International recognition gradually followed.Slovenia joined the European Union in 2004.According to Dimitrij Rupel, independent Slovenia´s first foreign minister, the country in southern Europe bordering Austria, Italy and others seized ""a very suitable moment"".""We gained independence in the middle of the European ´spring storm´ or, if you like, in the middle of the Yugoslav or Soviet crises at the end of the Cold War,"" Rupel told AFP.Slovenia, like Catalonia, had a strong economy, but had a greater degree of autonomy with its own ministries except for defence and interior affairs.Slovenia, Rupel said, took things slowly: ""We had a plebiscite that nobody tried to prevent, we carried it out in a peaceful manner, then waited six months before declaring independence.""""All together, nine months passed from the plebiscite until the end of the crisis. The process of international recognition extended then until the spring of 1992,"" he said.But more important was EU mediation and the three-month transition period. For Spain and Catalonia, such a period could allow ""all hostilities and threats to be suspended to allow talks"", he said.""The EU should set the framework for such a dialogue and then we could help with our experiences and sympathies,"" he added.Officially, Slovenia´s government has called for a peaceful solution to the Catalan crisis, saying it is an internal issue. But some leading politicians have made it clear where their sympathies lie.""As president I have to be aware that my position could be seen as an intrusion into domestic affairs of other states,"" Pahor said, insisting he backed Ljubljana´s official stance.""But it´s also right to say we Slovenians are aware that we reached independence through self-determination and that other peoples have that right too.""Independent Slovenia´s first prime minister Lojze Peterle has underlined that the circumstances in Yugoslavia then and Spain now are different.""We wanted to get rid of a non-democratic regime while Catalonians live in a democratic Spain,"" Peterle said last week.He also noted that although the Catalan government said 90 percent of voters backed independence in its October 1 referendum, turnout was below 50 percent. The vote was also not recognised by Madrid."

1499,"WASHINGTON: White House Press Secretary, Sean Spicer during a press briefing on Tuesday said the administration of US President Donald Trump was not looking at adding other countries to the temporary travel ban list.Spicer added that the administration is still in the review process and looking at all other countries. “As of this moment, there is no immediate aspiration to add any other country but we have measures and systems in place to check them and nothing is final until the end of the review period,” Spicer said.The US Justice Department faced tough questioning Tuesday as it urged a court of appeals to reinstate President Donald Trump´s travel ban targeting citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, put on hold in a legal challenge last week.The latest twist in the showdown comes four days after a federal judge suspended Trump´s decree, re-opening US borders to the thousands of refugees and travellers who had been suddenly barred from the country.Three judges from an appellate court in San Francisco chaired an hour-long telephone hearing followed online by more than 130,000 people -- a record, the court said -- and broadcast live to millions more on television.During the high-stakes hearing, an attorney for the government argued that Trump´s immigration curbs were motivated by national security concerns and that the federal judge had overstepped his authority in suspending them.""This is a traditional national security judgment that is assigned to the political branches and the president,"" Justice Department lawyer August Flentje argued.He said Trump had acted within his constitutional powers and those delegated to him by Congress in issuing the January 27 executive order in the interest of the United States.Tuesday´s hearing was focused on whether to lift the suspension of the ban, not on the constitutionality of the decree itself -- a broader battle that looks likely to go all the way to the Supreme Court.The appeals court would probably rule later this week, a court spokesman said.The three-judge panel often appeared skeptical during the hearing, with Judge Richard Clifton at one point calling the government´s argument ""pretty abstract.""The judges questioned Flentje about the evidence connecting the seven targeted countries to terrorism and pressed him on whether the ban amounts to religious discrimination, as its opponents claim. "

Morgan, who will be playing for Peshawar Zalmi in the second edition of PSL, told Geo.tv that he’s looking forward to the action packed league, hoping that Pakistan’s prestigious T20 tournament would provide entertainment for fans.“I am happy and excited to be here and being part of Pakistan Super League and Peshawar Zalmi. It has been a good three-four days meeting with everyone at the team, we got few days of practice ahead of the tournament and I am looking forward to it,” Morgan told Geo.tv in an exclusive chat in Dubai on sidelines of Peshawar Zalmi vs Quetta Gladiators warm-up match at the ICC Academy Ground.Morgan, a dependable middle order batsman with an experience of 173 ODIs and 67 T20Is for England, termed Peshawar Zalmi as the strong team of the tournament.“On paper, we are a very strong team which is always encouraging. Producing performance in early stage and getting on a roll early can be important, it builds confidence within the team,” he said.“Early signs (of team’s performance) are very good,” he said, referring to Zalmi’s performance in the practice T20 game against the Quetta Gladiators, which Zalmi won by 22 runs.The 30-year old aggressive cricketer aims to give his best for the team and said personal goals are never important than the team’s success.“My personal ambitions always revolve around success of the team, so putting a performance worthy of winning game, scoring 10 and winning the match is good than scoring 100 and losing the match,” said Morgan who scored 51, 17 and 40 in three T20I games against India before coming to Dubai for the Pakistan Super League.Morgan said the key to success would be the team efforts, adding that collective efforts would make it an easy sail for the team to move towards the target of winning the trophy.The English batsman said that it would be premature for him to compare PSL with other leagues of the world as he has yet to play matches in Pakistan Super League, but hopes that the league would provide a good arena to youngsters to showcase their talent."
1502,"ISLAMABAD: Electronic machines will be used for polling during the NA-4 by-election in Peshawar, a development in the country’s voting system taking place for the first time. “Around 100 electronic voting machines, along with technical staff, have reached the constituency, NA-4 Peshawar-IV, under a proper security mechanism,” stated a press release issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan on Saturday. “These machines will be used at 100 polling booths of 39 polling stations for the first time in the history of the country.”The technical staff of ECP will hold a session to demonstrate how the electronic voting machines can be used. The session will be conducted in the presence of the election commissioner of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, district returning officer, returning officers and 14 contesting candidates.Moreover, media persons would also be briefed on the machines use, which will reduce the duration of casting a vote to around 18 seconds.A pilot testing session would be held to check the machines, but it would not affect the official results, and a detailed report on its performance would be shared with the Parliament and media.Besides using machines for voting, ECP has decided to use mobile phones to send results of NA-4 Peshawar by-election from polling stations to the returning officer.According to an official of ECP, under the pilot project, the presiding officer will send the result of respective polling stations to the returning officer through use of this new technology, “which is more efficient and fast”.He said the result could be sent directly to the computer system of the returning officer. The ECP would be able to receive the results from polling stations faster through this system, the official added. Earlier, ECP had introduced this project in Karachi for the by-election of PS-114 on July 2017, which was successful.The ECP official said the commission had its own mobile phones which would be used in Peshawar by-election and that they had developed the software to receive the by-election results from 269 polling stations of Peshawar.A training session to explain proper use of the system to presiding officers will be held next week in Peshawar, the official said. Moreover, he added, ECP’s high-ranking officials will also be able to check the election results on their mobile phones.The seat of NA-4 in Peshawar for which by-election has been scheduled on October 26 fell vacant after Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s Gulzar Khan passed away due to a heart ailment. In the 2013 general elections, Gulzar won the constituency on a PTI ticket by garnering around 55,000 votes.

1503,"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump has gambled with US diplomatic credibility by attacking an Iran nuclear deal that his European allies cherish as a benchmark for international cooperation.And in doing so the US president has underlined the risk that his ""America First"" foreign policy will translate to one of ""America Alone"" as he confronts future crises.Between nationalist speeches, protectionist gestures and high-octane Twitter outbursts, observers have struggled to identify a coherent strategy behind Trump´s decisions.But one thread does stand out as he pulls out of trade deals, provokes allies and tears up international accords -- he seems determined that no international ties will bind him.The United States emerged as the indispensable superpower in the wake of World War II in part through its leadership in a global rules-based system of treaties and alliances.But, as Trump made clear last month in a speech to the UN General Assembly, his vision is of a world where America is just the most powerful in a network of sovereign nations.""Trump foreign policy has found its theme: ´The Withdrawal Doctrine´,"" quipped Richard Haass, the influential president of the Council on Foreign Relations.Trump has not yet withdrawn from the Iran deal, although he made it clear that he is ready to do so if Congress and sceptical US allies do not agree to new sanctions.He did quit the UN cultural organisation, this week. He has collapsed the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and appears to be poised to destroy the bigger NAFTA treaty.Time and again his bluster has put in question America´s commitment to its NATO allies, and time and again he has ordered reviews into the utility of remaining in UN agencies.He has even declared that America will drop out of the biggest -- and arguably most important -- accord in world history, the 196-member Paris climate deal.As might be expected, former members of President Barack Obama´s administration are furious and bewildered at what they see as an abdication of US leadership.""Once again, Trump is throwing into question the ability of the US to keep its commitment to international agreements,"" former top aide Ben Rhodes said.""Other nations will not want to enter into agreements with the United States,"" he warned.Former secretary of state John Kerry, who negotiated the Iran deal, called Trump´s decision a ""reckless abandonment of facts in favour of ego and ideology.""Trump, he said, ""weakens our hand, alienates us from our allies, empowers Iranian hardliners, makes it harder to resolve North Korea and risks moving us closer to military conflict.""But Democrats are not the only ones criticizing the Republican billionaire's stance.Nicholas Burns a professor at Harvard´s Kennedy School of Government and, like Haass, a veteran of George W Bush´s administration is scathing.""We´re withdrawing as global leader under Trump,"" he said, dubbing the decision to dump the TPP and Paris and undermine the Iran deal ""historic mistakes.""Washington´s traditional allies in Europe were at first cautious in their approach to Trump, hoping he would mellow as he grew into the Oval Office role.But they were outraged by his Iran gambit, and united in their response.""It is clearly not in the hands of any president of any country in the world to terminate an agreement of this sort,"" declared EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini.""The president of the United States has many powers (but) not this one.""In Washington, having failed to get through to Trump despite the support of some of his top advisers, European diplomats are now lobbying Congress to save the Iran deal.Nevertheless, the Iran decision at least has some strong supporters in Washington.An outspoken group of foreign policy hawks, backed by influential senator Tom Cotton and Trump´s UN ambassador Nikki Haley, had been pushing for ""decertification.""And they, at least, agree with Trump that his tougher stance could give America more leverage, rather than less, with its foreign partners.""If anything, the decision to decertify but keep the US in the deal could serve to bolster US credibility,"" argues Behnam Ben Taleblu, of the Federation for Defense of Democracies.Trump, he says, is ""sending a message that the US will not be a party to agreements where it feels it has a material disadvantage.""This theory will be put to the test almost immediately.In the weeks to come Trump and senior US officials will attempt to build a coalition to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear program."

The survival benefit ranged from about 1 to 6 months, and half the time was no more than 2.7 months.The evidence was even weaker for quality of life improvements, which at the time of approval were documented for just 7 of the 68 new uses of these new medicines, researchers found.“This does not necessarily mean that patients are taking unsafe or ineffective medicines,” said lead study author Dr. Courtney Davis of Kings College London.“What it means is that for around half of all new drugs coming on the market in the European Union, patients and physicians will not know whether the drugs offer survival or quality of life benefits over existing treatment options, or in some cases over no treatment,” Davis said by email. “It also means that where survival benefits have been shown, they may not be worth the risk of side effects or additional toxicity for some patients.”Many newer, targeted cancer medicines have offered fresh hope to patients with tumors that don’t respond to older drugs, but many of these new medicines carry hefty price tags in excess of $100,000 a year.Because some cancers grow slowly and can affect a large proportion of the population, studies to prove a survival benefit may need to run for decades and include large numbers of participants. This has prompted many new cancer drug trials to focus on different goals. For example, instead of proving that a drug helps patients live longer, studies may aim to show how long the drug keeps the tumor from growing larger.This has led doctors and regulators to question the necessity of some new treatments, particularly medicines approved based on studies that don’t document an overall survival benefit.“While it makes sense to use drugs that shrink cancer and slow growth, the reality is sometimes we do that, but a person doesn’t live any longer,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.For some recently approved cancer drugs, companies agreed to do additional studies testing for overall survival benefits as a condition of winning permission to sell the drugs.In the current study, after at least 3.3 years on the market, most of the new medicines still lacked conclusive evidence that they helped people live longer or offered patients a better quality of life.Among the 23 new uses out of 68 studied that had a survival benefit that could be assessed by researchers, only half were found to be clinically meaningful for patients, the study also found.“Some of these medicines probably do offer benefits, but we don’t know how much because trials are not done,” Prasad said by email. “But I also think many of these medicines don’t offer benefits, only harms and side effects.”Patients considering treatment with these newer medicines should focus on what proof there is that the drug will achieve the goal that’s most important in their situation, whether it’s survival or quality of life, Prasad advised.“Forget about asking your doctor how a new drug works,” Prasad said. “Forget all the hype you read. The only question to ask is what is the proof this drugs makes patients better off.”"
1507,"RAWALPINDI: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor on Saturday said the armed forces pose no threat to democracy in Pakistan.""There is no threat to democracy from the Pakistan Army, but there could be a threat to democracy if its requirements are not being met,"" he said.""I want to add that there needs to be stability. The government needs to continue and an established democratic system needs to continue,"" said the military spokesman. ""I have to say this because there are a lot of rumours about martial law and the installation of a technocratic government.""""We will play our part as and when required but whatever we do will be done by staying in our defined legal and constitutional limits,"" Major General Asif Ghafoor said while addressing a press conference. Referring to an earlier statement about the country’s economy that garnered harsh criticism from Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Ghafoor said that he felt disappointed by the minister’s reaction.“I was disappointed, both as a soldier and citizen, at what was referred to as an irresponsible statement by me,” he said. “The country’s security and economy are closely interlinked and directly related.""He added that the recently held seminar on the interplay of security and economy included all relevant stakeholders.”He insisted that all of the stakeholders, including the business community, have to come together to jointly tackle the current challenges to Pakistan’s economy.“The security situation plays a key role in the country’s economy and all stakeholders must jointly work to improve the country’s situation,” Ghafoor said. “I have never said in any of my press conferences that only the armed forces have worked hard against the current challenges; I have always said that all institutions have made great efforts to move towards a better future.”He added that all stakeholders will continue to make joint efforts to counter all challenges, adding that he stands by his earlier statement as that was the army’s stance and not his ‘personal view.’ Maj Gen Ghafoor, elaborating on the recently held seminar on Pakistan's economy in which the Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa delivered a keynote address, said that Gen Bajwa had also asked the attendees of the conference to pay taxes and play their role in strengthening Pakistan's economy. ""Last year, the taxes recovered were only 39pc, and from the private sector, the recovery was only 40pc. It is too meagre. That is all I said, that the tax base needs to be increased and I stand by it.""The army spokesman added that if Pakistan's economy follows the model of a borrowed economy than vital decisions, including decisions on security, can be compromised. ""If the economy is stable than out decision making will be stronger too.""The army spokesman said during the press conference that all decions made in the country are taken by the country's civilian leadership.“The state institutions work in collaboration with one another but decisions are taken by the elected civilian government,"" stated the spokesman.He further added that all decisions, whether it's concerning Rangers operations in Karachi or Punjab to the appointment of heads of armed forces, are sanctioned and approved by the civilian government. Discussing the regional security situation, the Army spokesman said that there is no more room to 'do more' in the fight against terrorism at the behest of other countries.Ghafoor said that the armed forces have done a lot in Pakistan and 'will do more for the motherland in collaboration with our institutions' but there is 'no more room to do more’ for other countries.""Pakistan has done a lot to improve its security situation in the past 15 years, especially during the past eight years,"" he said. ""Only trust-based relations with the international community can take us forward.""""If we have to move towards enduring peace and stability, only cooperation can take us forward,"" said Ghafoor. Talking of the recently conducted intelligence-based operation which resulted in the rescue and safe recovery of the Canadian-American couple, along with their children, Ghafoor said better intelligence sharing and cooperation can ensure better security. Describing the operation, DG ISPR said a call was received by the American ambassador at 4:10pm, informing us that the family was being transferred to Pakistan. On the information we received, we sent our troops and used surveillance means to detect the vehicles transporting the hostages. Elaborating further, Maj Gen Ghafoor said the army has a very heavy presence in the area ""but obviously we dont cover every inch"". ""We traced the two cars and cordoned them and fired on their vehicle. Our first priority was that the captives are brought out safely and wanted to isolate the captives and the terrorists so that the captives remain safe."" He added that the objective was to ensure the terrorists, a driver and three gunmen, don't fire on the hostages. ""Personnel of the ISI and the Army came between the terrorists and the fleeing terrorists so they could shield the hostages from gunfire. There is an Afghan refugee camp nearby, and the terrorists fled to it.""""We have been saying repeatedly that the Afghan refugees need to be sent back. It is difficult for us to distinguish who is a terrorist and who is a refugee in such situations.""After detailing the rescue operation, the Army spokesman played a clip of Joshua Boyle, one of the rescued hostage, who praised the professional conduct of the men who saved him and his family and also thanked the Pakistani Army and government for ensuring his family's safety during the rescue operation. ""It was incredibly professional and we thank the Pakistanis who rescued us,"" said Boyle in the video clip. ""It was tremendously professional and they took every effort to safeguard us. The car was riddled with bullets, the ISI and Army came in between us and the terrorists. There are good Muslims and those who are not Muslims. These guys [terrorists] are guided by external agendas,"" added the rescued Canadian. ""In the five years that we were held captive, we saw no presence of Afghan soldiers and there are areas in the country where there is no [Afghan] government presence.""""Pakistanis are doing everything to help the problem. Western media will look at Pakistan a bit different now, the country is on the frontline of the war against terrorism,"" further said Boyle. The Army spokesman, referring to the statement issued by President Donald Trump after the rescue, said that: ""You have seen the results, and you also saw Trump's statement. We feel happy that there is a level of trust and confidence that the US leadership has shown in Pakistan and Pakistan's security forces.""""We take it as a good start, and if a trust-based relationship continues, there will be positive results.""Referring to a question, Ghafoor said the Afghan war could not be won without Pakistan. ""We need to cooperate in ways that are mutually beneficial. Engagement builds trust. You can have apprehensions, which could be debated about but security cooperation is ongoing and will continue.""In response to a question regarding Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif's statement about joint operations between US and Pakistani forces against the Haqqani network, the DG ISPR said there is no concept of a joint operation on Pakistani soil. ""In military terminology, a joint operation means forces of both countries conduct an operation. There is no question of it. Full stop,"" said Ghafoor. ""There has never been and never will be any joint operation on Pakistani soil."""

1510,"A cautious Manchester United frustrated hosts Liverpool as a lacklustre North-West Premier League derby ended 0-0 on Saturday with neither side able to find the creative touch.The draw leaves United alone at the top of the table on 20 points although Manchester City, who are now a point behind, can regain first place when they host Stoke City later on Saturday.Those hoping for a classic blood-and-thunder clash of the two most successful clubs in English football were probably being overly optimistic but few would have predicted such an uninspiring 90 minutes at Anfield.United manager Jose Mourinho’s team selection suggested that, as last season, he would adopt a cautious approach to taking on Juergen Klopp’s side.Instead of Spanish craftsman Juan Mata on the right, the more defensively diligent Ashley Young started in the role and Marcus Rashford, carrying a slight knock from England duty, was left on the bench.With United’s Romelu Lukaku left alone - and isolated - in attack and French forward Anthony Martial shunting up and down the left with little inspiration, United sat deep and waited to see what Liverpool could do with the possession.The answer was not very much.Brazilian Philippe Coutinho drifted into pockets of space and from time to time threatened to produce something eye-catching, while Egyptian Mohamed Salah’s pace and dribbling caused some awkward moments for United left-back Matteo Darmian.But those glimmers of flair were not enough to create any sustained pressure on United and, as the second half drifted towards a goalless draw, neither side could find another gear or the inventiveness to create a clear opening.Liverpool’s best chance came in the 35th minute but United keeper David De Gea pulled off a superb save with his legs to keep out a shot from Joel Matip and Salah’s follow up was wide.United created little beyond a Lukaku shot two minutes before the interval which was well dealt with by keeper Simon Mignolet.The only half-chance of a poor second half came when Liverpool’s Emre Can tried to get on the end of a floated ball from Jose Gomez but could not turn his effort goalwards."
1511,"NEW YORK: US investors including Digital Currency Group have taken part in a pre-sale of basecoin, a crypto-currency to be created by three Princeton University computer science graduates, Intangible Labs CEO and co-founder Nader Al-Naji said.The other investors in Intangible Labs’ basecoin include Bain Capital Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and AngelList CEO Naval Ravikant, Al-Naji told Reuters.Digital Currency Group confirmed its investment in basecoin. Bain Capital, Pantera, and Andreessen Horowitz were not immediately available to comment.The investors had bought a unit of Intangible Labs, which entitled them to basecoin - a token with a rules-based monetary policy built into its blockchain system - in the future, Al-Naji said in an interview with Reuters on Friday.He did not disclose an investment figure.Blockchain, a digital ledger of transactions, underpins crypto-currency bitcoin and can be used to track, record, and transfer assets across all industries.Intangible Labs is one of many blockchain start-ups creating and distributing tokens to investors to raise funds for their projects. Start-ups typically hold a token pre-sale to institutional investors before opening the token offering to the public.Al-Naji, who founded the company with Lawrence Diao and Josh Shen, said basecoin essentially worked the same way as the Federal Reserve.“We found a way to keep the price stable while keeping all the other great features of crypto-currencies such as decentralized, private, and international,” he added.It originated from Al-Naji’s blog, called Nader Theory, in June in which he broached the idea of a stable coin that can shrink and grow its supply on the blockchain.The blog went viral and Ravikant of AngelList - a website that connects startups and investors - and Bain came to see him to discuss his idea. That set the wheels in motion, he added.Intangible Labs will release its whitepaper on Tuesday and the network will be launched anywhere between six months and two years’ time, Al-Naji said.“The problem we’re solving is simple: because bitcoin is so volatile, your mom is never going to buy her morning coffee with it,” Al-Naji said.“And you’d never even think about keeping all your savings in it. The fact is that bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are just playgrounds for speculation right now.”"
1512,"SARGODHA: Yet another labourer lost his life while working at a stone crushing site on Saturday, taking the death toll due to similar incidents to 16 over a span of 23 days. According to rescue sources, 33-year-old Gulzar was working, along with other labourers, up a hill at the stone crushing site in 120 South when a boulder took him down. The labourer died on the spot. He was a resident of Sargodha’s village 48 South. The labourers were working on a stone crushing site when the incident occurred A similar incident took place on September 27 that killed six on-duty labourers on the spot. The market where the incident took place in said to be the largest stone crushing site of Punjab, where building material of various sorts is prepared. The deaths usually take place when labourers climb the hills to place explosive material for blasting. They rush down to hide in a safe spot — usually a nearby cave — within a certain time period. But miscalculation on the direction of falling rocks claims their lives. Although offices of the mines, social welfare and security departments are present in Sargodha, they have not yet taken any step to put in place safety measures for the labourers, around 20,000 of which work at the stone crushing site daily. It is also said that families of over 60 labourers — who died in similar incidents earlier — have not yet got money under their death claims. "

It´s unfortunate,"" said Turkana police chief Ronald Opili.The Kenya Red Cross said it had evacuated those injured in the school attack by plane for emergency treatment.Turkana, an arid region bordering South Sudan, is awash with small arms and violent clashes between competing communities over resources and territory are common, as is armed raiding of cattle and livestock."
1514,"DAMASCUS: Syria on Saturday demanded the ""immediate and unconditional withdrawal"" of Turkish troops that have deployed in the country´s northwestern province of Idlib, state media said citing a foreign ministry source.Turkish troops entered Idlib on Thursday night as part of efforts to enforce a so-called ""de-escalation zone"" agreed by rebel backer Ankara and regime allies Russia and Iran at talks in Astana earlier this year.But the Syrian foreign ministry source slammed the ""Turkish aggression"", saying it had ""nothing whatsoever to do with the understandings reached by the guarantor countries in the Astana process.""The source added that the deployment was ""a violation of these understandings and a departure from them.""""The Turkish regime must abide by what was agreed in Astana.""Turkey´s military said Friday it had begun ""activities to establish observation posts on October 12"", days after Turkish troops launched a reconnaissance mission in Idlib.On Friday, Turkey´s Hurriyet daily reported over 100 soldiers including special forces, and 30 armoured vehicles, had entered Idlib.And a new convoy entered on Saturday, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor.The province is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group led by Al-Qaeda´s former Syria affiliate, which has ousted more moderate rebels in recent months.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkish troops had entered Syria with the Free Syrian Army, the name Ankara uses for rebels seeking Syrian President Bashar al-Assad´s ouster.Turkey says it is backing Syrian rebels in a bid to oust HTS members in the area and allow Iranian, Russian and Turkish forces to implement the zone.The ""de-escalation"" zone in Idlib is the one of four agreed in Astana and the last to be implemented, after.Idlib is one of the last major areas of Syria beyond the control of the government, which has recaptured vast swathes of territory from opposition fighters since its ally Russia intervened on its behalf in September 2015.Turkey has intervened in Syria before, last year launching its operation Euphrates Shield targeting Daesh and Kurdish fighters.More than 330,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests."
1515,"ABIDJAN: Four Moldovan nationals were killed on Saturday when a transport plane chartered by the French army crashed off Ivory Coast, firefighters said.Another six people were injured in the crash of the Antonov aircraft which had 10 people on board, firefighter Colonel Issa Sakho told local television.Four French nationals were among the injured, a French military source said, indicating that the plane had been chartered as part of the anti-jihadist Operation Barkhane.""There were 10 people on board, Moldovans and French people. The four victims who died are Moldovan nationals,"" Sakho said.The plane had taken off from Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso and crash-landed in the sea near Abidjan, breaking in half, he explained.Local forces were hoping to secure the wreck before it drifted away ""so investigators can do their job"", he said.A French military source said the Antonov was chartered as part of Barkhane, under which France maintains a 4,000-man mission in the region.The operation aims to shore up fragile Sahel countries against jihadists who have carried out a wave of bloody bombings, shootings and kidnappings.The French military base in Abidjan provides logistical support for the operation which is headquartered in N´Djamena, the capital of Chad. French special forces are stationed in Ouagadougou.Every year, around 100 sorties are flown out of Abidjan airport as part of Barkhane, often by former Soviet army pilots in Ukrainian-made Antonovs.The planes frequently carry French military personnel and sub-contractors accompanying their cargo.There was a heavy storm over Abidjan early Saturday, but it was unclear whether the heavy weather was the cause of the accident.France keeps around 950 military personnel in Ivory Coast as part of the FFCI force based in the biggest French army base on Africa´s Atlantic coast. Other bases are in Libreville, Gabon and Dakar, Senegal.One of their key missions is to extract French or other western civilians in case of trouble in Ivory Coast or neighbouring countries.Abidjan is strategically well-placed in the region as most French-speaking African countries can be reached by air in under three hours."

1519,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued on Thursday non-bailable arrest warrants of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in relation to a contempt of court case against him.The five-member ECP, bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Justice (retd) Sardar Raza Khan, heard the case. The ECP ordered the police to arrest Imran and present him before the commission on October 26.However, the PTI has said it will challenge the decision in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).Imran Khan should show that he respects the institutions, said the opposition leader Addressing the media, PTI's Babar Awan said the ECP has issued a non-bailable warrant in a case where a bailable warrant has already been dismissed by the IHC. Moreover, the petitioner in the case, Akbar Babar, said Imran challenges the authority of every institution that takes action against him. He said Imran cast aspersions against a constitutional body. At the last hearing, on September 27, the ECP had adjourned the case until the IHC decides on the party's petition regarding the proceedings.The CEC had observed that it will issue its order in the contempt case if the IHC does not decide the case on October 11.At the previous hearing on September 25, the PTI chief, in his reply submitted through his lawyer Babar Awan, stated that ""I respect the ECP and believe in the supremacy of institutions.""Khan stated that he confirms the apology tendered by his previous counsel, Saqlain Haider, regarding the ""contemptuous"" remarks, adding that the contempt of court matter is a ""closed transaction belonging to the past.""The PTI chief's counsel then requested the ECP to withdraw the show-cause notice issued on September 24.On September 14, the ECP had issued bailable warrants against Imran to ensure his presence in the case.PTI chief was directed at last hearing to submit response to fresh contempt petitionThe ECP had ordered Imran to submit a surety bond of Rs100,000 until September 25 and nominate two persons who would ensure payment of the amount and be held responsible otherwise.Imran was also ordered to appear on that day in the commission in person.However, the PTI approached the IHC which, on September 20, suspended the bailable arrest warrants. Hearing the case, Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a three-member larger bench, directed the PTI chief to reply to the ECP's show-cause notice.Babar Awan assured the court that the PTI chairman would reply to the ECP's show-cause notice with regards to contempt proceedings against him.The ECP had issued the contempt notice to Khan on January 24 over his “scandalous remarks” about the commission.Babar, the petitioner who had filed the foreign funding case against the PTI leadership, had informed the ECP that the PTI chief had accused it of being biased in the foreign funding case following which his counsel tendered an apology with the commission.Babar is also one of the founding members of the PTI. Several times since then, Imran has accused the ECP, among other government bodies, of being compromised and working for the benefit of Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister and head of the ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. "
1520,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) offered to hold talks with Iraqi authorities on the status of Kurdish airports, border posts and banks, on which they placed restrictions following an independence referendum.Baghdad took the measures in an attempt to isolate the KRG after last month’s referendum.The government in Baghdad, which declared the vote illegal, imposed a ban on direct international flights to the northern region. It also demanded that the KRG hand over control of its border posts, and stopped selling dollars to four Kurdish-owned banks.“To avoid this collective punishment, we invite (Iraqi Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi, again, that we ready to any from of dialogue and negotiations in conformity with the Iraqi Constitution,” the KRG said a statement published overnight.It offered discussions “regarding the crossings, internal trade, providing services to the citizens, the banks and the airports.”The statement marked a change of tack by Kurdish authorities, which on Wednesday accused Iraqi forces and Iranian-trained Iraqi paramilitaries of “preparing a major attack” on the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and near Mosul in northern Iraq. An Iraqi military spokesman denied any attack on Kurdish forces was planned, saying government troops were preparing to oust Islamic State militants from an area near the Syrian border.Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council issued arrest warrants on Wednesday for the chairman of the Kurdish referendum commission and two aides for “violating a valid (Iraqi) court ruling” banning the independence vote as against the Constitution.Neighboring Iran and Turkey back Iraq’s uncompromising stance, fearing the spread of separatism to their own Kurdish populations.Kirkuk, a Kurdish-held multi-ethnic region, has emerged as a flashpoint in the crisis between Baghdad and Erbil as it is claimed by both sides.Iraqi forces and Shi‘ite paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, in areas previously under the control of Islamic State.The area around the border post of al-Qaim, in western Iraq, is the last Iraqi region still under the control of the militants who overran a third of the country in 2014."

1523,"BARCELONA: A senior Catalan official said Saturday that an offer of talks with Madrid over his region´s independence push was aimed at negotiating secession from Spain, not halting it.The central government has given the Catalan president Carles Puigdemont until next Thursday to abandon designs on independence, failing which it may trigger unprecedented constitutional steps that could see Madrid take control of the semi-autonomous region.Puigdemont´s number two Oriol Junqueras said Saturday that dialogue with the central government ""must have at its heart the formation of the (Catalan) republic and our commitment to independence"".""We need to be clear that the best way of achieving an independent republic is to talk to everyone, including the international community,"" Junqueras told members of his Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) party in Barcelona.The wealthy region´s drive to break away from Spain has unleashed the country´s worst political crisis in a generation.After staging a banned referendum on October 1, in which separatists say 90 percent of people voted for secession, Catalan president Carles Puigdemont said last week he had accepted a ""mandate for Catalonia to become an independent state"".He immediately suspended the declaration, however, ostensibly to allow time for dialogue with Madrid.Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who has repeatedly said Catalan independence is not up for discussion, responded by giving Puigdemont a deadline to make up his mind.The journalist-turned-politician now has until Monday morning to declare Catalonia independent or not.If he does, he has until October 19 to change his mind or Rajoy has said Madrid will start taking direct control over the semi-autonomous region.As the standoff drags on, dozens of companies have moved their legal headquarters out of Catalonia, and concerns are rising that the crisis will severely damage the region´s economy and even dampen Spain´s growth prospects.Spain´s deputy prime minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria warned Friday that if ""there is no quick solution, we see ourselves having to lower economic forecasts for 2018"".The International Monetary fund has also voiced concern and ratings agency Standard and Poor´s said the region´s economy risked sliding into recession if the crisis persists.Spain´s Association of Registrars said Friday that 540 firms had sought to relocate their legal addresses from Catalonia from October 2-11.Puigdemont is under pressure from Madrid and EU states to remain part of Spain but also from his allies in the Catalan parliament who want the region to break away immediately.Adding to tensions, Catalonia is deeply divided over independence, and those who want to stay in Spain are increasingly making their voices heard, having staged two mass rallies in just five days.""The Spanish government is rejecting every day,"" the chance of international mediation in the crisis, Junquera said.But Madrid has never countenanced talks on a push it insists violates the constitution.It is ready to invoke article 155 of Spanish law, a never-before-seen provision that allows Madrid to take direct control of its devolved regions if it deems them to be acting against the national interest.The head of Rajoy´s Popular Party in Catalonia, Xavier Garcia Albiol, said Friday that measures could include changing the structure of the local Mossos d´Esquadra police force, as well as imposing more direct rule over education.Officials in Madrid are waiting to see what Puigdemont decides by the Monday deadline, but it is thought the Catalan leader could deliver what the central government deems another ""ambiguous"" response to the question of independence.""If that´s the case, that will show that he doesn´t want dialogue and so the Spanish government will need to take necessary measures to return to normality,"" said interior minister Juan Ignacio Zoido Alvarez on Saturday.Junqueras, who is under investigation for civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds over the referendum, said Catalans needed to be united ""for the good of (Catalonia)."""

1527,"HANOI: At least 37 people have died and another 40 are missing as floods and landslides ravage north and central Vietnam, destroying homes and leaving rescuers scrambling to find survivors, disaster officials said Thursday.Tens of thousands were evacuated after heavy rains lashed swathes of the country this week, as forecasters warned of more bad weather to come.Northern Hoa Binh is the hardest hit with 11 dead and 21 missing, prompting a state of emergency to be declared.""We are mobilising all forces to search for the missing,"" a disaster official told AFP by phone, declining to be named.Rescue efforts were hampered as water and mud submerged roads in several areas, including in Hoa Binh where eight died in an overnight landslide. ""People should be evacuated from dangerous areas, the safety of people and their belongings must be ensured,"" deputy prime minister Trinh Dinh Dung said on state-run Vietnam television. A terrified resident described severe flooding in another part of the province. ""The flash flood was terrible. Water poured down from the hill, like a surge three metres high. Traffic has been blocked because of the floods,"" Phan Ba Dien told state-controlled VNExpress news site. A journalist from Vietnam News Agency reporting on the storm was swept away along with four other people as an overflowing river demolished a bridge in northern Yen Bai province Wednesday. One survived and authorities were still looking for the other four on Thursday.Images on state media showed people wading through knee-deep waters and tracts of forests that had been wiped out by landslides. Road access was completely cut off in some areas. ""Water was just rushing downstream... it´s been a long time since I witnessed that kind of flooding in mountainous areas. I didn´t feel safe driving at night, it was scary,"" Hanoi resident Nguyen Vu Ngoc, who was travelling in the north on Wednesday, told AFP.The disaster has killed 37 people in six provinces, with more than 18,800 houses damaged or destroyed along with tens of thousands of hectares of farmland, Vietnam Disaster Management Authority said. Officials said they were focused on rescuing dozens of missing people Thursday as rain subsided in most areas.Residents desperately ferried furniture and other belongings over flooded roads in Son La province, where houses were demolished and electricity poles torn down. At least 400 millimetres (16 inches) of rain have swamped northern and central Vietnam since Sunday, the disaster agency said.Vietnam is routinely hit with severe weather, with nearly 170 people killed or missing in disasters so far this year. A massive typhoon slammed into the central coast last month, killing 11 people and devastating entire towns. The country is routinely slammed by tropical storms in the May to October period. Last year, nearly 250 were killed or reported missing in weather-related disasters. Forecasters said a tropical depression east of the Philippines is expected to enter the South China Sea and strengthen in the next few days as it heads toward Vietnam. "
1528,"YANGON: Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the US ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.“They are not the natives, and the records prove that they were not even called Rohingya but just Bengalis during the colonial period.”The UN human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar security forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.The UN rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced what she called a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military puts sufficient accountability measures in place.The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.Suu Kyi is due make a speech on television later on Thursday.She was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.Insurgents’ opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the attacks, he said.“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said. “They might have fled ... assuming that they would be safer there.”He said it was an exaggeration to say the number fleeing to Bangladesh was “very large” and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.He did not elaborate, or say how many people he thought had fled, but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community.UN political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit Myanmar on Friday.Min Aung Hlaing repeated a promise from Suu Kyi that refugees would be accepted back under an agreement with Bangladesh in the early 1990s, adding that details were being worked out.Many refugees doubt their chances of going home fearing they will not be able to prove their right to return."
1529,"HONG KONG/BEIJING : China said on Thursday it had the right to bar people from Hong Kong, a day after a British activist was denied entry into the former British colony, and that it had complained to Britain after it demanded an explanation.Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” principle that promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.But critics have accused the government of bending to the will of Communist Party leaders in Beijing and of a gradual watering down of the territory’s freedoms, including freedom of speech and right to protest.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he was “very concerned” that Benedict Rogers, a co-founder of the Conservative Party’s Human Rights Commission, was denied entry to Hong Kong on Wednesday and demanded an “urgent explanation” from Hong Kong and China.It came a week before a sensitive Communist Party leadership meeting starts in Beijing.Johnson also said Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms were “central to its way of life”.Rogers has been a vocal critic of China-ruled Hong Kong’s treatment of political activists, including that of jailed student leader Joshua Wong. He believes the decision to bar him was made by Chinese officials after the Chinese Embassy in London had warned him earlier, through a British member of parliament, that he wouldn’t be allowed in.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the central government had a responsibility for foreign matters related to Hong Kong.“The central Chinese government and the special administrative region government handle the relevant issue in accordance with the law,” Hua said. “Allowing or not allowing people in is China’s sovereignty ... Hong Kong affairs are a purely internal matter for China.”She said China had lodged a solemn representation with Britain, meaning an official complaint.When asked about the incident on a radio talkshow, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam agreed.“Ultimately, under the Basic Law (Hong Kong’s mini-constitution), the central government is responsible for foreign affairs,” Lam said.Asked if immigration controls fell under Hong Kong jurisdiction, Lam said: ”It has to be considered whether foreign affairs are involved during the process of immigration.“If you say everything falls under Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy, this is not what the Basic Law says.”The case has raised questions over the promise of autonomy and the former head of Hong Kong’s civil service turned pro-democracy activist, Anson Chan, said the case was a “serious breach” of the Basic Law.Article 154 of the Basic Law says Hong Kong “may apply immigration controls on entry” of foreigners into Hong Kong.“The Immigration Department must have sought instructions from on high,” she told Reuters. “They (Beijing) are sending a message that if you dare speak out on Hong Kong ... you will not be allowed in.”Amnesty International’s East Asia director, Nicholas Bequelin, suggested China’s definition of what constitutes national security is creeping into Hong Kong.“In China if you’re critical of the political system, you’re committing a national security crime and this is exactly the type of thing ‘one country, two systems’ should protect against.”Hong Kong’s Immigration Department didn’t immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether China was involved in Rogers’ denial of entry.China has admitted asking a group of British MPs to cancel a visit to Hong Kong in 2014 during the massive pro-democracy protests, of which Joshua Wong was a leader, that paralyzed highways for 79 days.Hong Kong has, on occasion, barred entry to individuals including dissidents, such as former leaders of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing and a Danish sculptor, Jens Galschiot, who made a Tiananmen sculpture."
1530,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court resumed hearing on Thursday the petition filed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Hanif Abbasi seeking the disqualification of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Jahangir Tareen today. Sikandar Bashir Mohmand, Tareen's counsel, is presenting his arguments to the three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar.During the court proceeding, Tareen's counsel said that the court should tell where his client lied in his nomination papers.In response to the question, the chief justice said that Tareen didn’t disclose his ownership of an agriculture land. He added that the counsel should read Representation of People Act's Section-12 to know what action can be taken on misdeclaration.The chief justice said that the court is taking into consideration matters related to integrity and honesty.  The chief justice observed that though the agriculture land in question was on lease, the earnings received from it would qualify as assets and thus had to be shown in the required documents. He added that Tareen did not mention his complete assets in the election forms. The chief justice also remarked that they are trying to understand the law and not giving a final opinion on the matter. At the last hearing on October 11, the bench observed that there is a clear difference in the assets details submitted by the PTI lawmaker in the election nomination papers and the details submitted to the Federal Board of Revenue. Tareen's counsel informed the bench on Tuesday that 18,500 acres were acquired by his client in 2010 on leasePresenting his arguments, Mohmand had informed the court that his client has declared all his assets.He argued that the bench is conducting a tax audit of his client, saying that the petitioner wants to waste time and should be told to take the case to the Federal Board of Revenue.Justice Umar Ata Bandiyal remarked that they are conducting disqualification proceedings at the core of which is the issue of misdeclarations in election nomination forms.When Mohmand objected to the questions in the forms for the electoral nomination papers, the court said it will examine the form and see if the objections hold true.However, the bench observed that regardless of the 'objections', all land holdings should have been mentioned in the form.At the core of the case is the matter of over 18,500 acres that were acquired by Tareen on a lease. Tareen's counsel has said that the PTI leader grows sugar, mangos, and cotton on his farms.The problem arises as the land, being on a lease (thaika), was not mentioned by Tareen when he submitted his nomination forms for the 2013 General Elections. "

1532,"An astonishing discovery was made by Uppsala University researchers in Sweden recently, according to which they found Arabic characters woven into funeral clothes of the Viking graves. The words were ‘Allah’ and ‘Ali’.The recent findings have opened a gateway of questions regarding the civilisation and the influence of Islam on the Vikings, whose age spanned from late 8th century to the mid-11th century.The clothes, belonging to the 9th and 10th century, were left ignored as they were considered as conventional Viking grave clothes.The researchers were trying to reconstruct textile patterns for an upcoming exhibition at the museum of Enkoping when the Kufic character patterns were discovered on the silk clothes.Annika Larsson, a researcher in textile archaeology at the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Uppsala University, spoke to Swedish science portal Forskning and said: “Presumably, Viking Age burial customs were influenced by Islam and the idea of an eternal life in Paradise after death"".She said that the possibility of the graves being of Muslims cannot be ruled out.The team is now collaborating with the university's department for immunology, genetics and pathology to ascertain the geographic origins of the bodies inside those graves."

1534,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s ferocious war on drugs will shift to a higher gear to target “big fish”, officials said on Thursday, moving away from street level operations to go after big networks and suppliers.Duterte issued a directive on Tuesday ordering the police to halt activities in the anti-drug campaign and leave all operations to the drug enforcement agency, amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct.The national police chief disbanded all 18 regional anti-drugs units on Thursday and said the resources would be channeled into fighting other crimes.“We now target higher echelons of the syndicates, as well as their protectors in government,” presidential spokesman Ernesto Abella told reporters.Abella said the street level distribution networks of the “drug lords” had been degraded due to successful police operations in the 15-month old campaign.The message will sound familiar, with similar announcements made a year ago, when the authorities launched Project Double Barrel Alpha to focus on tracking down drug producers and suppliers.Critics say that never happened and the crackdown has been fixed on peddlers and users in urban poor neighborhoods, which have borne the brunt of the 3,900 killings by police during anti-drugs operations.Police say armed suspects resisted arrest in every one of those cases and deny allegations victims were executed. Police say some 2,300 killings by unknown gunmen have also occurred, likely drug-related.Duterte has lashed out several times when responding to comments from experts, calling some “idiots” for contradicting his views, or for advocating strategies to target the source of the drugs, rather than consumers.The change in tack comes at a difficult time for Duterte, who though still hugely popular, saw a sharp decline in ratings according to an opinion poll released on Sunday.It also followed an anti-Duterte protest last month by thousands of people in Manila, and a series of surveys that point to doubts among many Filipinos about the validity of police accounts, and whether those killed were all drug dealers.Duterte’s move follows the high-profile August killing of a 17-year-old student by police, which triggered rare public outrage.The new order that sidelines the police and leaves the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) the sole agency for the drugs war could impact the intensity of the crackdown.It has only a fraction of the manpower and budget of the police. Duterte placed PDEA in charge back in January and suspended police from all anti-drugs operations, but reinstated them a few week later, arguing that drugs had returned to the streets.PDEA spokesman Derreck Carreon said the agency had about 2,000 personnel and funds for only 200 new agents next year.Its proposed budget allocation for 2018 is 2.6 billion pesos ($50.63 million) compared to 131.2 billion the police, which has 175,000 men.Nonetheless, PDEA was up to the task.“We are ready, we can do it,” Carreon said.“We will target the source, the so-called big fish. Removing these high-value targets will also eliminate the street level distribution and disrupt the entire network.”Carreon said he could not guarantee there would be less bloodshed.“We follow the procedures, we don’t want an encounter but we also have to protect ourselves if drug suspects resist and fight back,” he said.The death toll has been a source of international concern that the Philippines has not taken kindly to, with its diplomats echoing Duterte’s defiant rhetoric and complaining of Western hypocrisy.A group of lawyers on Wednesday filed an injunction with the Supreme Court to try to stop the war on drugs, calling it as an illegal campaign that lets police kill and circumvent legal procedures.Some senators on Thursday said they would still scrutinize the crackdown, regardless of who leads it.“Changing of the guard is not enough,” said Senator Risa Hontiveros. “Duterte must stop and scrap the ‘Oplan Tokhang’ anti-drug campaign.”"
1535,"Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau said Wednesday it had detained a deputy defence minister and another top military official for allegedly embezzling millions in state funding through an illegal oil-purchase scheme.The announcement was the highest-profile indictment against any official since the Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) launched a graft case against the now-deposed tax service chief Roman Nasirov in March.NABU did not identify the two defence officials but said the fraud had cost the budget 149 million hryvnias ($5.6 million / 4.7 million euros at today's exchange rate) in 2016.The bureau said the arrangement involved an oil purchase contract that was later revised to inflate the original price by 16 percent to benefit the unnamed supplier.""NABU detectives and special anti-corruption prosecutors have detained two suspected culprits -- a deputy defence minister of Ukraine and the director of the state resource procurement and supply department of the Ukrainian defence ministry,"" NABU said in a statement.Ukraine's defence ministry said an investigation into two officials whose titles matched those named by NABU was in progress but provided no other details.Corruption has long ravaged the crisis-torn former Soviet republic and been a top concern of both Ukraine's foreign partners and global financial support organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).But NABU has faced stiff resistance since its launch in December 2015 from institutions such as the general prosecutor's office and the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).Analysts view both as controlled by vested interests and incapable of leading independent probes into financial misdeeds.The IMF is pressing the pro-Western leaders who rose to power after a 2014 revolution ousted a Russian-backed regime to shore up NABU's efforts by setting up a special anti-corruption court.They say those indicted by NABU often walk free after paying bail and point to Nasirov's case as an example.Nasirov is still under investigation by the general prosecutor's office and has only been barred from leaving Kiev while he cooperates with the authorities in the slow-moving case.Poroshenko told a meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in the French city of Strasbourg on Wednesday that Ukraine had reached ""the point of no return for judicial reform"".""I know that the creation of the Anti-Corruption Court draws special attention,"" Poroshenko said in comments released by his office.""Currently, we are looking for optimal way to establish this vital body.""Poroshenko said the current draft law on anti-corruption courts had problems and required broader concensus.""That is why there is a need for all democratic political forces and civil society to get united,"" Poroshenko said."

1543,"DUBAI: Sri Lankan opener Dimuth Karunaratne hit a career-best 196 which left Pakistan fighting to avoid defeat in the second day-night Test in Dubai on Saturday.Karunaratne missed a double hundred by four runs but lifted Sri Lanka to an imposing 482 in their first innings before Pakistan finished the second day at 51-0, still trailing by 431 runs.Openers Sami Aslam (30 not out) and Shan Masood (15 not out) negotiated the 18 overs under light without any major trouble but Pakistan still needs 231 to avoid the follow-on.That leaves Pakistan in a spot of bother to square the series after losing the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi and, more importantly, save their seven-year unbeaten series record in the United Arab Emirates.It was another brilliant display by the Sri Lankan batsmen led by left-hander Karunaratne.Karunaratne deserved a double hundred during a marathon nine-hour stay at the crease but he was unluckily dismissed, playing onto leg-spinner Yasir Shah just before dinner.Karunaratne hit 19 boundaries and a six, improving on his previous best Test score of 186 made against the West Indies at Galle two years ago.When on 143 he brought up his 3,000th run in his 44th Test, the 12th Sri Lankan to reach that milestone.Shah took 6-184 in a marathon 55.5 overs of hard work and toil on a flat Dubai stadium pitch. His haul makes him the only spinner ever to take five or more wickets in five consecutive Tests.England's Sydney Barnes holds the record for most consecutive five-wicket hauls with seven in as many Tests. Australia's Charlie Turner and Englishman Alec Bedser had six consecutive five-fours - but all three were fast bowlers.Karunaratne added 146 with skipper Dinesh Chandimal (62) for the fourth wicket before another 88 were put on for the fifth between him and Niroshan Dickwella, who made a rapid 52.As if that was not enough, Karunaratne put on 59 for the sixth wicket with Dilruwan Perera, who scored a polished 58.Resuming at 254-3, Sri Lanka lost Chandimal to a leg before decision off Shah. Chandimal knocked six boundaries in another enterprising knock which followed his unbeaten 155 in the first Test.Dickwella's assured knock had five boundaries before he edged pacer Mohammad Abbas to wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed while Perera smashed seven boundaries before becoming Shah´s fifth wicket -- his 13th five wicket haul in 28 Tests.Abbas then had Suranga Lakmal for eight to finish with 2-100 while Shah ended the innings by dismissing Nuwan Pradeep for nought.Pakistan´s miseries were compounded in the morning when pace spearhead Mohammad Amir walked off the field after a recurring shin injury sustained late on Friday. He managed to bowl just three overs in the day.Pakistan trail by 1-0 in the series after they lost the first Test by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi.Pakistan, who have never lost a Test series in the United Arab Emirates, also wasted both their reviews off the second new ball to cap a woeful day for them yesterday.Chandimal's team will look to become the first to win a Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, whereas for Pakistan, it is a must-win encounter to save the series."
1544,"ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday announced pro-Ankara Syrian rebels were launching a new military operation in Syria's northwestern Idlib province to push out the militants who control the region.The move comes as Turkey, along with Russia and Iran, prepare to set up a so-called ""de-escalation"" zone in Idlib in line with accords in peace talks in Astana aimed at ending the Syrian civil war.Turkish commando units and military vehicles have reportedly massed on the border but are yet to cross, in what will be Ankara's second major Syria operation after its Euphrates Shield incursion last year.""We are taking new steps to ensure security in Idlib. Today, a very serious operation is ongoing in Idlib and this will continue,"" Erdogan said in a televised speech in the western city of Afyon.He later told reporters the operation was led by Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels and that the Turkish army was ""not yet"" operating inside Syria.Aron Lund, fellow with The Century Foundation think tank, told AFP any Turkish operation ""is likely to rely on a mix of Turkish and Syrian forces"".He said Turkey would contribute special forces, logistics, artillery and tanks but Syria rebels would make up ""much of"" the ground force.Idlib is largely controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group led by Al-Qaeda's former Syria affiliate, which ousted more moderate rebels in recent months.HTS is not party to a deal brokered by Russia, Turkey and Iran for the safe zone in the province, one of four such ""de-escalation"" zones across Syria.""If Turkey decides to go head to head with HTS, I'm sure they will meet severe resistance,"" Lund told AFP.Ousting HTS forces from the area will be needed to allow the arrival of Iranian, Russian and Turkish forces to implement a de-escalation zone.""We will absolutely not allow the creation of a terror corridor along our borders,"" said Erdogan.State-run Anadolu news agency said there was a major buildup of commando units and military vehicles around the town of Reyhanli bordering Idlib close to the Cilvegozu border crossing.The Hurriyet daily said ultimately Turkey would ensure security in Idlib city and Russia in the surrounding area.Appearing to confirm this, Erdogan said: ""Idlib is a region where we will provide protection on the inside and Russia on the outside.""Turkish army cranes had begun removing sections of the security wall Turkey has built on the border in apparent preparation for an incursion, an AFP photographer said.Turkey earlier this year wrapped up its half-year Euphrates Shield operation against militants and Kurdish militia in Aleppo province that involved both the Turkish army and Syrian rebels.""Despite all the provocations and the obstacles, we have made significant progress in Syria,"" said Erdogan.A rebel commander participating in the operation, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told AFP in Beirut that ""all the rebel groups"" who took part in Euphrates Shield are participating.""The goal of the operation is to liberate Idlib fully from Tahrir al-Sham,"" he said.Turkey has also long warned it could also move against Kurdish militia in Afrin to the east. Erdogan warned that ""new initiatives"" would follow after the Idlib operation.But Ankara is playing no part in the US-backed assault to prise the Syrian city of Raqa from the Islamic State group due to the involvement of Kurdish militia Turkey considers a terror outfit.The Idlib operation comes a week after Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with Erdogan in Ankara, with both sides agreeing to push for the Idlib de-escalation zone.Afer those talks Putin declared the right conditions now existed to end the over six-year civil war that has killed an estimated 330,000 people since 2011.Despite being on opposite sides of the conflict, Russia and Turkey have been working together intensely since a 2016 reconciliation deal ended a crisis caused by the shooting down of a Russian war plane over Syria.Russia, along with Iran, is the key backer of President Bashar al-Assad and Moscow´s military intervention inside Syria is widely seen as tipping the balance in the conflict. Turkey, however, has backed rebels seeking Assad´s ouster.Commenting on the coordination with Russia, Erdogan said: ""Relations with the regime is something looked after by Russia, and we have taken measures in other areas."""
1545,"COX’S BAZAR: A top official of the United Nations said Saturday Bangladesh’s plan to build the world’s biggest refugee camp for over 800,000 Rohingya Muslims was dangerous because overcrowding could heighten the risks of deadly diseases spreading quickly.The arrival of more than half a million Rohingya refugees — who have fled an army crackdown in Myanmar’s troubled Rakhine state since August 25 — has put an immense strain on already packed camps in Bangladesh.Hard-pressed Bangladesh authorities plan to expand a refugee camp in Kutupalong near the border town of Cox’s Bazar to accommodate the Rohingya.But Robert Watkins, the UN resident coordinator in Dhaka, told AFP the country should instead look for new sites to build more camps.""When you concentrate too many people into a very small area, particularly the people who are very vulnerable to diseases, it is dangerous,"" Watkins told AFP.""There are stronger possibilities, if there are any infectious diseases that spread, that will spread very quickly,"" he said, also highlighting fire risks in the camps. ""It is much easier to manage people, tackle the health situation and security if there are a number of different camps rather than one concentrated camp."" On Dhaka’s request the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) has agreed to coordinate the work of aid agencies and help build shelters at the new camp site.According to the IOM, the proposed camp will be the world’s largest, dwarfing Bidi Bidi in Uganda and Dadaab in Kenya – both housing around 300,000 refugees.Three thousand acres of land next to the existing Kutupalong camp have been set aside for the project. ""A camp for 700,000 is a big one... we and our partners will have our work cut out for us,"" Joel Millman, an IOM spokesperson, told reporters in Geneva on Friday.But he added UN agencies ""wouldn’t be undertaking this if we didn’t think it was feasible"".An estimated 331,000 Rohingya have already set up makeshift shelters in the area before construction begins, according to Watkins. Bangladeshi officials say the new camp will help them better handle relief operations and manage security amid fears that dispersed camps could become recruiting grounds for militants.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said some refugees would also be relocated to a new island, which emerged from the sea just a decade ago, where they would be provided with shelter, health and education facilities. ""We have some plans about the Rohingya. No one can live the way they are living now,"" she told a rally in Dhaka.The Rohingya have opposed the idea of moving to Bhashan Char island — also known as Thengar Char — saying they will be exposed to powerful and deadly cyclones that frequently hit Bangladesh’s coastal belt.But Hasina said the government would build cyclone shelters for the refugees.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said last month that any relocation to the island should be ""voluntary on the part of the refugees"".This week Bangladesh reported 4,000-5,000 Rohingya were crossing the border daily. Observers believe, according to an IOM statement on Friday, that as many as 100,000 more people may be waiting to cross into Cox’s Bazar from Rakhine’s Buthidaung Township. Watkins said the continuing influx represented ""a very big challenge"" for aid agencies. ""Just when we start to think we are getting on top of the situation, the numbers go up. We are not where we need to be right now,"" he said. ""There is still a lot more needed to be done."""
1546,"MADRID: Catalonia´s government has threatened to declare independence after the region voted in an outlawed referendum.Here are six key players in Spain´s deepest political crisis in decades:The 62-year-old leader of the conservative Popular Party (PP) has served as Spain´s prime minister since December 2011.Rajoy has headed a minority government since a 2016 general election, backed by centrist party Ciudadanos.His detractors accuse him of not having done anything to stop separatist sentiment from surging in Catalonia.Rajoy argues he could not negotiate an independence referendum in the region because it violates Spain´s constitution which declares the country indivisible.The 54-year-old president of Catalonia, a former journalist, has advocated for independence since his youth.He became head of the regional government at the start of 2016.He said Wednesday that the region would declare independence in days after 90 percent of voters who took part in the referendum backed Catalonia breaking away from Spain.Puigdemont has said he is willing to go to jail over his separatist push.He is under investigation for alleged crimes of civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds for staging the plebiscite.Spain´s deputy prime minister, 46, is in charge of the central governmen's relationship with its regions.She launched an ""operation dialogue"" with Catalonia´s separatist government but failed to convince them to drop their plans to hold an independence referendum.Spain´s central government in March promised to invest 4.2 billion euros ($4.9 billion) in Catalonia, mostly in rail infrastructure, between 2017 and 2020.That was considered by many to be too little too late in a region which has long demanded more powers and money for infrastructure.Oriol Junqueras The 48-year-old is the leader of the leftist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) party, which has called for Catalan independence since 1931.A lawmaker in the European Union parliament between 2009 and 2011, since January 2016 he has been the vice president of Catalonia.Like Puigdemont, this history professor at the University of Barcelona is also being investigated for civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds over the referendum.Carme Forcadell The president of the Catalan regional parliament since October 2015, she has for years helped organise massive street demonstrations for Catalan independence. She belongs to the ERC party.She was fiercely criticised in early September for pushing through two laws that paved the way for the referendum through the assembly with little debate.The laws were swiftly suspended by Spain´s Constitutional Court.She is also being investigated for civil disobedience, abuse of office and misuse of public funds.This 43-year-old former social activist was elected mayor of Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia, in 2015.She became well known as the spokeswoman of a group that fought housing evictions at the height of Spain´s economic crisis.Colau says she has never been pro-independence but she defends Catalonia´s right to hold a secession referendum with the agreement of Spain´s central government.Colau and her leftist Catalunya en Comu party say separatists cannot unilaterally declare independence as this would not be recognised internationally."

1548,"DUBAI: Pakistan suffered a major setback ahead of the ODI series against Sri Lanka when the fast bowler Mohammad Aamir was ruled out of the five-match series due to a stress injury in his right shin.Amir, 25, was taken off the field after bowling 19.3 overs in Sri Lanka’s first innings on Saturday, the second day of Dubai Test. He struggled with the same issue on day one of the Test as well.A statement from PCB says that the fast bowler underwent MRI scans after complaints of pain in his shin and following the scans he has been advised a rest of two to three weeks.“The fast bowler has been advised two to three weeks rest after he underwent MRI scans today following complaints of pain in his right shin,” said the statement from PCB.“Amir will not bowl in the on-going Test match at the Dubai Cricket Stadium, but would available to bat,” the statement added.His replacement in ODI squad will be announced in due course.Mohammad Aamir, since he returned to international cricket in January 2016, has bowled 821.3 overs collectively across all three formats in international cricket, third-most by a fast bowler after Kagiso Rabada (896.3) and Josh Hazlewood (846.1)."
1549,"UNITED NATIONS: Russia on Friday complained that UN investigators, who, this week, travelled to a Syrian airfield allegedly used to launch the sarin gas attack on Khan Sheikhun, did not take samples, a lapse described as ""scandalous"".Known as the JIM, the team from the joint UN-OPCW probe travelled to the Shayrat airfield ahead of the release later this month of its much-awaited report that could lay blame for the attack on the Syrian government.Russian foreign ministry official Mikhail Ulyanov told a briefing at the United Nations that four investigators visited the airfield, spoke to military personnel, and checked flight plans, but ""did not take samples.""""A reliable investigation is simply impossible without sampling,"" said Ulyanov, adding that this was ""a scandalous situation"".A spokesman for the JIM declined to comment.Ulyanov — the foreign ministry's head of non-proliferation — said the sarin attack at Khan Sheikhun was most likely caused by a bomb set off directly on the ground and not by a Syrian air strike.The United States, France, and Britain have accused President Bashar al-Assad's forces of carrying out the April 4 air assault on the opposition-held village.At least 87 people, including more than 30 children, died in the attack that drew global outrage over the use of banned sarin as a weapon.A few days later, the United States launched a missile attack on Shayrat after concluding that Syrian aircraft, loaded with sarin gas, had departed from that airfield to attack Khan Sheikhun.During the UN briefing, Ulyanov showed photographs of children with dilated pupils from sarin exposure that he said had been ""poisoned"" with narcotics ""to heighten the emotions around this chemical incident"".After showing video footage of rescuers who quickly arrived at the town, the official said he had the ""clear impression"" that the team was there ""well before it happened"", suggesting it was staged.Syria's government has denied any involvement in the Khan Sheikhun attack and maintains it no longer possesses chemical weapons after a 2013 agreement under which it pledged to surrender them.Russia — Syria's ally — helped set up the JIM investigation to identify who is behind the use of chemical weapons in Syria.Moscow, however, is weighing whether to allow the JIM to continue its investigations when its mandate comes up for renewal next month.Ulyanov said Russia will study the JIM's report on Khan Sheikhun, to be released on October 26, to ""judge if it deserves the extension""."

1551,"WASHINGTON: The Weinstein Company is exploring a sale or shutdown as it reels from the fallout of allegations of serial sexual misconduct by its ousted co-chairman Harvey Weinstein, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday.The film and television studio is unlikely to continue as an independent entity, the Journal said, citing a person close to the firm.Weinstein's film studio fired him on Sunday after an explosive New York Times report alleged he had preyed for decades on young women hoping to break into the film industry.An avalanche of sexual harassment claims has subsequently taken Hollywood in its grip in the wake of the Times report, with American actress Rose McGowan Thursday becoming the fourth woman to accuse Weinstein of raping her.Investigations are underway by police in New York and Britain.As it mulls its future after the accusations, the studio's board of directors has been talking to possible buyers, the Journal said.Some potential suitors have approached board members and others close to The Weinstein Co, but it remains uncertain whether a deal can be reached for the studio to continue operating.The alternative is that The Weinstein Co would be shut.Board members are no longer considering a previous plan that could have seen co-chairman Bob Weinstein — Harvey's brother — continue operating the studio with president David Glasser under a new company name, the Journal's source said.Harvey and Bob Weinstein — as co-founders of Miramax Films — burst onto the indie film scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s with films such as Sex, Lies and Videotape, Shakespeare in Love, and Pulp Fiction.Together the brothers went on to co-found the Weinstein Company in 2005, producing such hits as The King's Speech and The Artist."

It motivates us.“It’s something that we want. It’s something that if we could have in every match, we would have in every match.”The manager used Barcelona’s La Liga match against Las Palmas on Oct. 1 as an example. Barcelona played the game behind closed doors following clashes between police and voters in Catalonia over a disputed independence referendum.”When Barcelona played against Las Palmas in an empty stadium, do you think the players were happy with that?“ Mourinho asked. ”Do you think the Las Palmas players wouldn’t prefer to play in a Nou Camp that is full with a great atmosphere?”We go to play against a big team with a big tradition, in an amazing stadium. We know the fans have huge animosity against Manchester United historically but this is what we want.“So we are very happy in our careers to have one more opportunity to play in these beautiful conditions. It is beautiful to play at Anfield. Beautiful.”United are unbeaten so far this season with six wins and one draw, while Juergen Klopp’s Liverpool are seventh with three wins, three draws and one defeat, and Mourinho said both teams were evenly matched.“I look at them with the potential they have, the quality of their players and the team. It’s a very difficult match for us and I believe they think it is a difficult match for them,” he added."
1554,"PESHAWAR: The parents of the Army Public School massacre’s martyrs protested on Saturday against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan, announcing to hold demonstration in front of the Chief Minister House in case the inquiry report of the attack is not released within the next two weeks.The parents of the children — who were slain in the shattering incident of terrorism which took place in 2014— chanted slogans against the PTI chief at the archives library in the school.The bereaved parents also rooted up the board of the archives directorate. President martyrs forum Ajoon Khan said that Imran Khan had said that the archives library will be named in the honour of the martyrs but no step was taken in this regard. The president of the committee said that the inquiry report of the incident wasn’t produced up till now, adding that the parents have filed a plea to gain access to information under the legal framework.The parents said that their claim is against Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pervaiz Khattak and Imran Khan, alleging that their children were dead because of them.Three years ago, on December 16, 2014 147 people, including 132 schoolchildren, were massacred in the deadliest terrorist attack in Pakistan’s history when terrorists stormed Army Public School in Peshawar Cantonment and opened indiscriminate fire."
1555,"SUKKUR: Opposition leader Khursheed Shah on Saturday said that everyone, from a common man to the army chief, has the right to comment on economy—taking an opposite position to the interior minister's statement that the Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) should refrain from commenting on the country's economy.Speaking to media in Rohri, Shah said that there is nothing wrong with the army chief commenting on the state of the economy since he was the “commander-in-chief” of the army. A weakened economy means a weakened army, he said.Commenting on the scuffle outside accountability court ahead of indictment proceedings against Sharifs, Shah said that the incident ""should open the eyes of every Pakistan as to where we going as a nation"". He added that the Pakistan Peoples Party is working to ensure that the different institutions of the country are not at loggerheads, and advised Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and other politicians to do the same.Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Friday that Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) should refrain from passing comments on the country's economy.In a statement issued on Friday, the interior minister also said that irresponsible remarks can affect the international standing of Pakistan.“Pakistan’s economy is much more stable now than in 2013,"" said Iqbal. Iqbal further said that there has been an increased pressure on imports due to the investment in energy projects, but added that the pressure is bearable. The interior minister further elaborated that there has been a two-fold increase in the collection of taxes, adding that the biggest development budget in the country's history is being implemented. Referring to the ongoing security operations being conducted in the country, the interior minister said resources are being provided as needed. The interior minister, who is visiting the annual meeting of World Bank and IMF, said it is unfortunate that he has had to answer to the comments made by people due to DG ISPR’s statement.“People asked me why there was need for such a statement, what weakness does your economy have that there was a need for the statement,” said the interior minister while talking to Geo News.“Pakistan’s economy has been referred to as a turn-around economy by the world and all international organisations and segments are calling it an emerging economy.”He also quashed rumours that Pakistan would again need to approach the IMF and said it’s an effort to discredit Pakistan’s economy and added certain opposition members are making irresponsible statements.“It happens nowhere in the world that one plays with the economy for one’s politics,” said the interior minister.“Pakistan’s economy is stable and we have achieved the highest growth rate during the last decade.”“The army chief pointed out things that we are all aware of. He made a balanced statement which talked of the economic challenges and successes.”“Even we understand that tax collection in Pakistan is a challenge and if the army chief said it, than it is something that no one can disagree with but DG ISPR saying the economic situation is not bad but not good either is an unreasonable statement in my opinion,” added the interior minister.He reiterated that we should refrain from such statements as international quarters are commending Pakistan’s economy.   In a talk show on a private TV channel on Thursday, the DG ISPR Major General Asif Ghafoor stressed that there is a need to sit together and discuss the country's economy.""The security of the country and its economy are deeply linked with each other.""Major General Ghafoor said the economy is affected if the circumstances are not good.Commenting on the war against terrorism, the DG ISPR said several countries have given up their fight against terrorism.He added that the terrorists have become aware that they cannot enter into and hide in Pakistan.The World Bank, in the recently released report, 'South Asia Economic Focus Fall 2017', said macroeconomic uncertainties are increasing due to which the balance of payments is disrupted.The ongoing fiscal deficit is primarily due to lack of foreign reserves, added the report.Making the right fiscal policies can alleviate Pakistan’s economic woes, asserted the report. It suggested that an increase in exports can help improve the balance of payments.Higher exports, decrease in imports, and stable remittance flows can ensure stability vis-à-vis balance of payments, said the report.The report also mentioned that the problems pertaining to the financial framework can decrease the ratio of growth of the economy.Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf Chairman Imran Khan referred to the interior minister's statement as an absurd attack on the ISPR, ""as the dismal state of the economy is known to the world"". The PTI chief alleged that the statement from the interior minister is part of the Dawn Leaks agenda to malign the armed forces of Pakistan.Awami Muslim League Chief Sheikh Rasheed also rejected Iqbal's statement and said that the rulers are confused.“DG ISPR also shared the policy of Pakistan Army,” he said, adding that Iqbal is actually targeting the army chief with such statements."

1557,"KIMBERLEY, SOUTH AFRICA: The return of leading all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan provides encouragement for Bangladesh ahead of a three-match one-day international series against South Africa starting at the Diamond Oval in Kimberley Sunday.But Bangladesh, outplayed in two Tests against the hosts, will have to contend with a South African team strengthened by the inclusion of AB de Villiers, one of the world´s most dazzling limited-overs batsmen.Also back in international action for South Africa is JP Duminy, who retired from Test cricket after a run of low scores, but who remains a highly effective one-day player.In the most recent one-day outings for both teams, Bangladesh reached the semi-finals of the ICC Champions League in England in June, while South Africa failed to advance beyond the group stage.Bangladesh were victorious in their two most recent one-day internationals against South Africa when they won a series at home in 2015. But the hosts will start strong favourites.South Africa have won 14 of 17 one-day matches against Bangladesh and triumphed in all six previous encounters in South Africa by convincing margins.Bangladesh will be under new leadership with veteran bowler Mashrafe Mortaza captaining the side instead of Mushfiqur Rahim, who remains in the squad.Although Shakib´s return from a brief sabbatical will strengthen the tourists, they still rely mainly on the players who suffered two crushing Test defeats.Nor was there any encouragement for Bangladesh when they were convincingly beaten by an invitation team in a warm-up match in Bloemfontein on Thursday, despite Shakib top scoring for the tourists with 68.For South Africa, the series is the first step on a road to the 2019 World Cup.Faf du Plessis has replaced De Villiers as the one-day captain and together with new coach Ottis Gibson will be seeking to build a squad capable of challenging for global honours.West Indian Gibson said the intention was to give opportunities over the next year to a large number of players, effectively serving notice to players currently in the squad that they need to perform to remain in the mix.South Africa: Faf du Plessis (capt), Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock (wkt), AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Imran Tahir, David Miller, Wayne Parnell, Dane Paterson, Andile Phehlukwayo, Dwaine Pretorius, Kagiso RabadaCoach: Ottis Gibson (WIS)Bangladesh: Mashrafe Mortaza (capt), Imrul Kayes, Liton Das (wkt), Mahmudullah, Mehidy Hasan, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim (wkt), Mustafizur Rahman, Nasir Hossain, Rubel Hossain, Sabbir Rahman, Shakib Al Hasan, Soumya Sarkar, Tamim Iqbal, Taskin Ahmed.Coach: Chandika Hathurusingha (SRI)Oct 15: KimberleyOct 18: PaarlOct 22: East London"
1558,"The police are not a powerful club in Pakistan: the military is, the judiciary is, intelligence agencies are and even the DMG, but not the police. Cops probably remain the most maligned group in the state and are the easiest to scapegoat. Exhibit? Two cops being the only ones punished in the Benazir Bhutto murder case.Pending decision on their appeal, the Lahore High Court has suspended the sentences awarded to the police officers (charged under Sections 119 and 201 of the PPC for concealment of design to commit an offence that the police were duty bound to prevent, and for causing disappearance of evidence). The PPP has decided to challenge the decision. Why is the PPP making all this noise now after exhibiting almost no interest in the trial when in power? We are entering an election year. It is time for the PPP to bring back the memory of Benazir Bhutto.There are a few things we keep being told about BB’s tragic assassination. One, the police ordered that crime scene be washed after one hour and forty minutes of the attack. Two, the police didn’t order an autopsy to be conducted and thus didn’t confirm BB’s cause of death. And three, part of the police contingent on duty at Liaquat Bagh was sent to attend to the shooting incident involving Nawaz Sharif on Islamabad Highway.Put together, these three matters constitute the smoking gun that frames cops for aiding and abetting. Let us consider each one of them.The logic behind highlighting the washing down of part of the crime scene (the entire crime scene wasn’t washed, but only the part that was smeared with the blood of the victims and the bomber) is that it was done to wash away vital evidence that could help determine identity of the attackers. And so it is claimed that if you find who ordered the washing, you’ll get to the root of the conspiracy.In its order suspending the sentences against the cops the high court asked that if 28 articles of evidence were secured by the police from the crime scene, “then what kind of evidence was destroyed by washing out the spot”? What we know from the record is that the limbs and facemask of the suicide bomber, along with the gun he fired (together with empties), were recovered from the crime scene (along with blood, debris and bodies). From the evidence collected, the appearance of the suicide bomber was reconstructed.The suicide bomber’s DNA matched the blood on the gun used and the empties that were collected matched the gun. His DNA matched items of clothing recovered from the house of his handlers in Rawalpindi. The handlers, aiders and abettors charged for the assassination and later released by the trial court made admission statements and their story was backed up by phone records and their whereabouts on the fateful days (through geo-fencing).Rehman Malik, the PPP’s interior minister and in charge of BB’s security at the time of her assassination confirmed this in an article published after the trial court verdict in The News on September 7 this year:“Baitullah Mehsud fulfilled his claim to kill her with his men with the local support of anti-PPP elements. The police had arrested accused Hasnain Gul and Muhammad Rafaqat on January 5, 2008. They subsequently made confessional statement under Section 164 CrPC before a magistrate, disclosing having picked up accused Nasarullah and two suicide bombers namely Bilal and Ikramullah from Daewoo terminal Rawalpindi on December 26, 2007; providing shelter to them at the house of accused Rafaqat Hussain; having carrying out reconnaissance of Liaquat Bagh on December 27, 2007 and bringing both the suicide bombers to the crime scene for suicide attack on Benazir. Graphic forensic mobile phone confirms the interconnection and presence on the scene. The subsequent call record and RBS locations analysis had corroborated the confessional statements of both the accused Hasnain Gul and Rafaqat Hussain.” The Scotland Yard team had reached the same conclusion in February 2008:“All the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person…Body parts from only one individual remain unidentified. Expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber…Analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion. The footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber…The inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which Ms Bhutto was travelling.”Scotland Yard had critiqued procedures for collection of evidence etc, but had affirmed that “the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn” regarding the cause and circumstances of BB’s death. With the identity of the killer and handlers determined beyond doubt, along with the mode of attack, what more could be found at the crime scene?The second issue flagged is that of autopsy. The prosecution’s case was that the cause of death was skull injury caused by impact against the escape hatchet of the armoured vehicle. In its report, Scotland Yard reproduced findings of the UK Home Office pathologist, Dr Nathaniel Cary, who stated that, “the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast…in my opinion Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle.”Scotland Yard concluded that, “Ms Bhutto’s injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch. Detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence. Ms Bhutto’s head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast. She can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle. Whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained, the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred.”Asif Zardari stated on record that he did not grant permission to conduct an autopsy. There is no credible alternative theory on the cause and circumstances of BB’s death. Her head had no exit wound and the X-ray conducted at RGH confirmed that there was no bullet in the head. Given that there is neither any doubt about who attacked BB nor about the cause of death, the washing of the blood at the crime scene (which isn’t prohibited by law) or the lack of an autopsy becomes irrelevant.The third issue involved a decision to send an ASP with his team to attend to the Islamabad Highway incident. Record suggests that box security around BB’s vehicle was intact at the time of attack. The SP punished by the trial court was only meters away at the time of the attack. The attack took place outside Liaquat Bagh when BB’s jeep was on the road and a police escort vehicle that wasn’t damaged in the attack followed BB’s vehicle toward the hospital. What would another ASP and his team have done in this case?There is broad consensus amongst those who have analysed the circumstances surrounding BB’s assassination that the attack was executed by operatives of Al-Qaeda/TTP on Baitullah Mehsud’s orders, as detailed by Rehman Malik in his article. The controversy is thus limited to the motive of the attack: was Baitullah motivated by personal hate for a liberal female leader opposed to his ilk or did he do so on someone else’s behest? With Baitullah and all his underlings claimed by drones, we will never find out.The cops can only be blamed if we conclude that no suicide attack can ever be carried out without security forces being complicit. In relation to dozens of suicide attacks across Pakistan that have claimed thousands of lives, this is the only one where we have attributed blame on such flimsy basis.The writer is a lawyer based in Islamabad. Email: [email protected]"

The marriage ended and the inmate was later released to Canada.The families of the captives have been asked repeatedly why Boyle and Coleman, who was pregnant at the time, had been backpacking in such a dangerous region.Boyle´s family spent five years fighting to keep the case in the media spotlight in Canada, sharing the few ""proof of life"" videos or letters they received over the years. In 2016, a video released by an affiliate of the Afghan Taliban and later posted to YouTube showed for the first time the two sons of Boyle and Coleman.In the video, Coleman begs for an end to their ""Kafkaesque nightmare"" and is critical of both the American and Canadian governments and the family´s Haqqani captors.Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States Aizaz Chaudhry welcomed the successful rescue of the US-Canadian couple and their children from Taliban captivity, saying it was a lesson that “cooperation, and not blame game, is key to eradicating terrorism.”Speaking at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, Ambassador Chaudhry said that Pakistan's security forces acted within hours on the basis of actionable US intelligence.He also extended warm felicitations to the rescued couple’s family in the United States and Canada.""No one should have to experience the pain and anguish that Ms. Coleman and her family had been put through in the past years.

An AFP reporter said crowds in the area had fled screaming in panic.Armed police were deployed to the scene and the whole area was cordoned off.Security is high in Britain after five terror attacks since March -- four of them in London and one in Manchester -- with the bloodshed claiming 35 lives.Three of the attacks in London involved the use of a vehicle to plough into pedestrians.Prime Minister Theresa May offered her thanks to the emergency services, adding: ""My thoughts are with the injured.""London's Metropolitan Police said they were called to the scene at 2:21 pm (1321 GMT) after reports of a collision.One witness, identified only as Katy, told LBC London radio she had seen two people injured, including a young boy whose leg was hurt and a woman.Another who gave his name only as Leonard, told AFP: ""I was near South Ken station and there were many police.""Suddenly a policewoman officer shouted at the crowd to run, and everybody flew in panic, many people screaming.""A spokesman for the Natural History Museum told AFP: ""I can confirm that there has been a vehicle collision with pedestrians on our Exhibition Road entrance.""Not far away, tens of thousands of football fans took part in a silent protest ""against extremism"", walking from Park Lane past Downing Street and to parliament.The Football Lads Alliance was formed after the London Bridge attack in June and brought together supporters of rival teams with military veterans.Ahead of the march, founder John Meighan said the group wished to ""show our concern at the recent upsurge in terror attacks taking place across the UK and Europe"". "
1568,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said there is a need to ensure the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) works in an honest, impartial manner, instead of expanding its ambit to the army and judiciary.In a statement, Shehbaz said that the judiciary and army already have a system for accountability in place.NAB has failed to hold accountable corrupt people and looters of the national exchequer and needs to work impartially, the statement said. The chief minister said that a strict accountability system is needed in the country.New commission will only have jurisdiction over federal institutions The leaders of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) in August agreed to form a new body to replace NAB, although no major development on the matter has happened so far.Pertaining to the jurisdiction of the new commission, PPP had claimed that judiciary and the Army should also be investigated by the commission."
1569,"KARACHI: At least three including a woman and a child were injured after a collision between an oil tanker and truck caused oil spillage near Saeedabad area of Baldia Town, in the wee hours of Tuesday. According to details, the oil tanker was carrying around 25,000 litres of furnace oil when it crashed with a truck near Hub River.The driver of the oil tanker fled the scene after the collision ignited a fire on the oil tanker.The crash left a hole in the oil tanker, causing oil to spill over onto the road. Due to the oil spillage, a car slipped off the road and fell into a ditch, resulting in serious injuries to the passengers. Three, including a woman and a child, were reported injured in the car crash. The injured were shifted to Murshid Hospital.The traffic police moved the oil tanker away from obstructing the road, while the police started search for the absconded driver."
1570,"WASHINGTON: US Supreme Court justices on Monday expressed scepticism towards part of an immigration law requiring the deportation of immigrants who commit violent felonies because of uncertainty over which crimes fit the bill and which do not.The justices heard arguments in the government’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that language in the Immigration and Nationality Act calling for the deportation of legal immigrants convicted of a “crime of violence” was so vague that it violated their rights to due process of law under the US Constitution.The case involves a Filipino legal immigrant named James Garcia Dimaya who federal authorities ordered deported after he was convicted in two California home burglaries, though neither crime involved violence.The ruling in the case could help clarify the crimes for which non-citizen immigrants may be expelled, affecting the Trump administration’s policy of stepping up the removal of those with criminal records. There has been an intense focus on immigration issues since Republican President Donald Trump took office in January.Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee who joined the court in April, could cast the deciding vote.Monday’s arguments marked the second time the court has tried to tackle the case. It heard arguments in January when the nine-seat court was one justice short, but decided in June after Gorsuch brought the court to full strength to have the case re-argued.Several justices questioned the role of courts in judging certain crimes as violent. “Lots of burglaries are done with open doors or with jimmying without injuring a lock,” liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.Gorsuch told Trump administration lawyer Edwin Kneedler it was up to the US Congress to clearly specify who is covered by laws it passes “when it’s going to put people in prison and deprive them of liberty and result in deportation.”Kneedler said Congress had reasonably identified a category of crimes that carry the risk of violence, and suggested that the justices should defer to the immigration authorities.Conservative Justice Samuel Alito appeared to back the government, suggesting that too loose a standard for finding non-criminal laws vague might cause many other laws to fall. “We might do a wonderful job of pruning the United States Code,” he said, referring to the compilation of federal criminal and civil offences.Dimaya came to the United States from the Philippines as a legal permanent resident in 1992 at age 13. He lived with his family in the San Francisco Bay area, and had worked in several retail store jobs, including as a manager.He was convicted in residential burglaries in 2007 and 2009 in crimes in which no violence was used and no one was injured. He was sentenced to two years in prison for each conviction.In 2010, the government began a process to deport Dimaya. The Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals, the highest US administrative body for interpreting and applying immigration laws, refused to cancel his expulsion because the law involved defined burglary as a “crime of violence.”In the federal criminal code, a “crime of violence” includes offences in which force either was used or carried a “substantial risk” that it would be used.The San Francisco-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2015 that the definition as applied to non-citizen immigrants was unconstitutionally vague and can lead to arbitrary enforcement of the law.The appeals court relied on a decision that same year by the US Supreme Court, which found that a similar provision in a federal criminal sentencing law was overly broad.The case was argued on the first day of the court’s new term. A ruling is due by the end of June."
1571,"Stephen Paddock appeared to be settling into a quiet life a few years ago when the 64-year-old apartment manager and avid gambler bought a home in a quiet Nevada retirement community about an hour’s drive from the Las Vegas Strip and his beloved casinos.Those who knew Paddock say there was no sign he was capable of holing up in a room on the 32nd floor of a casino hotel, the Mandalay Bay, and opening fire with multiple guns on a country music festival, killing at least 59 people and wounding more than 520 in the worst mass shooting in modern US history.“He was a wealthy guy and he liked to play video poker and he liked to go on cruises,” the gunman’s seemingly baffled brother Eric Paddock told reporters from his doorstep in Orlando, Florida, on Monday.“He’s never drawn his gun, it makes no sense,” Eric Paddock said. He said he was aware that his brother had a couple of handguns he kept in a safe, perhaps a long rifle, but no automatic weapons.Police say they recovered a total of 34 weapons belonging to Paddock, including 16 from the hotel room and 18 at his home in Mesquite, a small desert town popular with golfers and gamblers. Some were automatic weapons or semi-automatic rifles illegally modified into machine guns.Eric Paddock described his brother as peaceful, saying he moved back to the red desert hills of Nevada because gambling is legal there and he hated Central Florida’s humidity.Police identified the gunman as area resident Stephen PaddockPaddock apparently lived in Mesquite with his girlfriend, who was in Tokyo at the time of the shooting. Las Vegas police said they were seeking to interview her when she returned. Authorities said she had no connection with the attack.The brothers were last in touch in early September, exchanging text messages about power outages after Hurricane Irma slammed into Florida, where their mother still lives.“He had nothing to do with any political organisation and religious organizations”, Eric Paddock said.Their father was Patrick Benjamin Paddock, a bank robber who was on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Most Wanted list in the 1960s and essentially unknown to his sons. The shooter himself had no criminal record, Las Vegas police said.In recent weeks, Paddock made gambling transactions worth tens of thousands of dollars, although it was unclear whether they were wins or losses, NBC News reported, citing unidentified law enforcement officials.Public records point to an itinerant existence across the American West and Southeast: Florida, a few years in California, a few years in other parts of Nevada.A spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin said Paddock worked for a predecessor of the company from 1985 to 1988, but offered no other details.Paddock had a hunting licence in Texas, where he lived for a while. He got his pilot licence and had at least one single-engine aircraft registered in his name.In early 2015, he bought a modest two-story home in a new housing development for retirees on the dusty edge of Mesquite, which straddles Nevada’s border with Arizona.“It’s a nice, clean home and nothing out of the ordinary,” Quinn Averett, a Mesquite police department spokesman, told reporters on Monday.The FBI said Paddock had no connection with international militant groups.Before moving to Mesquite, Nevada, he lived in another town called Mesquite, in Texas, where he worked as the manager of an apartment complex called Central Park. The Washington Post reported that Paddock had also worked as an accountant and had real estate investments.Records as recent as 2015 list Paddock as single, though it appears he may have married while living in California in the 1980s.Paddock’s age places him in the minority of mass shooters, said Laura Dugan, professor of criminology at the University of Maryland.“Most shooters are fairly young,” Dugan said. “Right now with this particular case, it’s baffling. Why would a guy in his 60s who seems to be well-off, go and do a thing like that?”"
1572,"ROME: The Italian Football Federation (FIGC) yesterday unveiled its new logo with four stars representing the country’s World Cup triumphs ahead of the 2018 finals in Russia.The Azzurri won the trophy in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006 and are second only to Brazil who lead the way with five titles.“The FIGC’s new visual identity completes a process of renewal that began three years ago, we look to the future by valuing our history,” said FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio.“The new logo has made the four-star world triumphs more visible because they represent the pride of the whole country.”The logo — which includes the word ‘Italia’ — features a more modern design than the crest introduced after the 2006 World Cup victory and will appear on the new Italy 2018 home jerseys to be released later this month.Italy first started using the blue jersey of the Azzurri in 1911."
1573,"WASHINGTON: The Trump administration will order nearly two-thirds of Cuba’s diplomatic personnel to leave the United States after months of mysterious “attacks” that have damaged the health of American embassy staff in Havana, according to a congressional source and a person familiar with the plan.The US State Department is expected to announce the expulsion on Tuesday, the sources said on Monday.The decision follows an announcement on Friday that the United States was cutting its diplomatic presence in Cuba by more than half as it warned US citizens not to visit because of unexplained incidents that have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in US embassy personnel.The latest plan was first reported by the Miami Herald, which cited a source as saying the expulsion of Cuban personnel was in “reciprocity” for the US drawdown from Havana.The steps being taken by President Donald Trump’s administration mark a further blow to his predecessor Barack Obama’s policy of rapprochement between Washington and Havana, former Cold War foes.The State Department declined to comment on an expulsion plan, except to say that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson “continues to evaluate steps that the Department can take to ensure the Cuban government is accountable to its responsibility to protect diplomats.”Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be expelled in retaliation for the Cuban government’s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks.Trump administration officials planned to brief lawmakers on their Cuba policy on Tuesday, another congressional aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The State Department announced on Friday that in addition to drawing down staff in Havana to essential personnel, the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to US citizens.At least 21 US embassy employees in Cuba have been injured and reported symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues, and difficulty sleeping, the State Department said on Friday.Cuba’s Foreign Ministry Chief for US Affairs Josefina Vidal said last week that the US decision to reduce staff at its Havana embassy was hasty and will affect bilateral relations.Cuba, the United States and Canada have investigated the attacks, but the probe has not yielded any answers about how they were carried out or who was responsible for them.Cuba has denied involvement in the attacks. The State Department has not directly blamed Havana for them but asked two Cuban diplomats to leave Washington in May.The US measures will stop short of breaking off relations or closing the two countries’embassies, which reopened in 2015 following more than five decades of hostility.But the bizarre case has brought simmering US-Cuba tensions since Trump took office to a boil.Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama, called the Cuban government “corrupt and destabilizing” in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month.He said he would not lift the US trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made “fundamental reforms.” Cuba described his comments as “unacceptable and meddling.”"
1574,"LAS VEGAS: At least 59 people were killed and 527 injured when a gunman opened fire on concert-goers Sunday night in Las Vegas.Here's what we know about the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history:A crowd of more than 22,000 people was listening to country music star Jason Aldean at the Route 91 Harvest Festival when bursts of automatic gunfire erupted around 10:08 pm (0508 GMT).Police said the lone shooter opened fire with multiple weapons on concert-goers from his 32nd floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel-casino across the street on the famed Las Vegas Strip.""People started grabbing their loved-ones and just strangers, and trying to help them get out of the way,"" said Ralph Rodriguez, IT consultant who was at the concert with a group of friends.Police identified the gunman as Stephen Craig Paddock, a wealthy retired former accountant from Mesquite, Nevada, around 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of Las Vegas.The sole suspect in the shooting, the 64-year-old Paddock killed himself in his hotel room as a police SWAT team was about to break in.Police recovered at least 16 rifles from his room, and later found a weapons cache including over 18 firearms, explosives and several thousand rounds of ammo at his home in Mesquite.A former accountant and a licensed private pilot, police said Paddock had had no known brushes with the law.Eric Paddock, the gunman´s elder brother, told local media he could not fathom what motivated him.Stephen Paddock regularly played high-stakes video poker but was wealthy and had ""no religious affiliation, no political affiliation,"" the brother said.Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said 59 people had been confirmed dead and 527 wounded.The toll could yet rise but the Las Vegas Strip shooting is already the deadliest ever in the United States, exceeding the toll of 49 killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016.In a televised address, Trump described the massacre as an ""act of pure evil"" but said it would not shatter the nation´s ""unity.""Trump refrained from addressing the unproven claim of responsibility from Daesh, or calls for gun control and the White House said it would be ""premature"" to reopen the US debate on tighter gun restrictions.Trump led White House staff and senior US officials in a moment of silence on the South Lawn of the White House, and announced he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday."
1575,"NEW YORK: Fans of rocker Tom Petty poured out their grief Monday on reports he had died of a heart attack -- until it turned out that he hadn´t.The 66-year-old rocker appeared to have serious health problems, but his daughter angrily dismissed news organization´s reports that he had died.TMZ, the Los Angeles celebrity news site known for its scoops, first broke the story with news that Petty had been found unconscious at his home in Malibu on Sunday night.TMZ later reported that he had been taken off life support. CBS television, quoting an unnamed police source, soon afterward said definitively that the rocker had died.But the Los Angeles Police Department denied it was the source of the information. Writing on Twitter, the department said that ""initial information was inadvertently provided to some media sources.""""We apologize for any inconvenience in this reporting,"" it tweeted.Music magazine Rolling Stone, quoting CBS and TMZ, ran an obituary of Petty complete with a quote from rock legend Bob Dylan, who played with him in the former Traveling Wilburys supergroup.The rocker´s daughter, artist Annakim Violette Petty, flatly denied he was dead and lashed out at Rolling Stone.""How dare you report that my father has died just to get press because your articles and photos are so dated?"" she wrote in a profanity-laden Instagram post along with an image of Tom Petty on a 1979 cover.But she suggested in other posts that her father was indeed facing health issues. She thanked well-wishers, saying, ""This has been the longest day of my life"" and writing, in a nod to the Black Lives Matter movement, ""Dad Lives Matter.""Representatives for Petty did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the coroner´s office said he had no information of Petty´s death, while a police official said the department would not normally comment on a death unless there were suggestions of foul play.The embarrassing mix-up brought stunned reactions to social media as well as some light-hearted remarks.""Leave it to Tom Petty to Not Back Down,"" screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer tweeted, referring to one of Petty´s best-known songs.Numerous fans and celebrities had already posted remembrances of Petty without any official word on his dead.""I loved Tom Petty and I covered his songs because I wanted know what it felt like to fly,"" tweeted singer John Mayer, quoting from his song ""Wildflowers"": ""You belong somewhere you feel free.""""You hang in there, Tom Petty.

1577,"LOS ANGELES: Three films are essentially tied at the top of the weekend box office, as of Sunday morning.Warner Bros. and New Line’s “It” appears to be back on top with $17.3 million (£12.9 million) from 3,917 locations. But Universal’s “American Made” and Fox’s “Kingsman: The Golden Circle” are trailing just behind with $17 million each. Since the numbers are so close, some studios are waiting until later in the day to make the official call. Meaning this one likely won’t be settled until Monday morning.What’s certain is that Sony’s remake of “Flatliners” is coming in below expectations. After getting killed by critics (0% on Rotten Tomatoes) the horror flick is opening to $6.7 million from 2,552 locations.“American Made” stars Tom Cruise as a commercial airline pilot who’s recruited by the CIA to fly reconnaissance missions over South America. A $17 million opening is modest for movie starring Cruise, but the studio is hoping for a long runway based on positive reviews and word of mouth. The movie has been earning money overseas for the past few weekends, giving it $64.7 million in international grosses so far. 55% of the domestic audience is male, and 56% is over the age of 30.“There were people out there who had us at a little less. It’s not a disappointment -- it’s an overachievement,” said Universal’s distribution chief Nick Carpou, who also addressed opening the film against so many others with R MPAA ratings. “I think that the rating of the film is secondary to the content of the film,” he said. “To me, it feels like a fall release.”If “It” returns to the top spot after taking second place to “Kingsman” last weekend, it would be a feat. The horror movie smashed records for the month of September when it opened and went on to become the highest grossing horror movie of all time. After this weekend, “It‘s” domestic total stands at $291.2 million.“The Lego Ninjago Movie,” from Warner Bros., looks to land in fourth ahead of “Flatliners” with $12 million from 4,047 locations. Fox Searchlight’s “Battle of the Sexes” expanded to 1,213 where it’s earning $3.4 million. The rest of the top ten is “American Assassin” ($3.3 million, 3,020 locations); “Home Again” ($1.8 million, 2,370); “Til Death Do Us Part” ($1.5 million, 562 locations); and “Mother!” ($1.5 million, 1,840)."
1578,"Manchester United’s injuries gives team mates the opportunity to prove their worth and flourish for the starting side, the Premier League club’s manager Jose Mourinho has said.Frenchman Paul Pogba is the latest to join United’s long-term injury list with a hamstring problem but the club have won five consecutive games without the playmaker, including Saturday’s 4-0 league win over bottom-side Crystal Palace.United have been dominant over the last five games, scoring 17 goals and conceding just two, and Mourinho is focused on the players on the pitch rather than those absent from it.“When we moan all the time about injuries it looks like we don’t trust the other people and we have to. We never miss the players that are injured, that’s our way of seeing,” Mourinho told British media.“They are injured, we don’t think about them. It’s an opportunity for others, is a moment for others to step up and to get the chance, so I think that’s good.”Pogba scored two goals and provided two assists in four league appearances before sustaining the injury and his midfield partner Nemanja Matic is confident that the 24-year-old will regain his form once he recovers.Matic also echoed his manager’s words, saying that United had “great players” that could help them win despite the absence of key players.Last year’s top-scorer Zlatan Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo are yet to return from serious knee injuries sustained last season, while midfielder Michael Carrick has missed the previous two games with a knock.Mourinho also said that it was too early to assess United’s title chances as they lie second in the league table, behind local rivals Manchester City on goal difference, after seven games.After the international break, United renew their fierce rivalry with Liverpool when they travel to Anfield on Oct. 14."

Two-time World Cup champions Argentina haven't missed the tournament since 1970, but five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi and his compatriots, runners-up in Brazil three years ago, are currently languishing in fifth place.While that would not spell the end of the road for Argentina, instead sending them into a two-legged play-off against New Zealand, even that is far from assured with Copa America holders Chile lurking just a point behind in sixth.Europe will provide 14 of the 32 competing teams in Russia, the hosts included. But so far only Belgium have punched their ticket to the finals going into the last two sets of fixtures.World champions Germany, who need just a draw in Northern Ireland on Thursday, lead a handful of other sides who can wrap up qualification this week.England are five points clear in Group F, while Serbia are in control of their section and 2010 champions Spain have the edge over Italy in their two-horse race.The nine group winners progress automatically, while all but one of the runners-up advance to the play-off round to determine the final four qualifiers.Portugal, while sure of at least making the play-offs, face a critical final match at home to Switzerland as Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates look to overturn a three-point deficit in Group B.France hold a tentative one-point cushion over Sweden in Group A and will be all too aware of the dangers posed by a trip to Bulgaria, the country responsible for their absence at the 1994 World Cup.Five places are on offer in Africa, but none as yet have been claimed. Nigeria are closing in on a sixth World Cup appearance, with reigning continental champions Cameroon and Algeria out of the running in a challenging section, but Zambia could still deny the Super Eagles.Tunisia are well positioned to end a 12-year World Cup exile, leading nearest rivals the Democratic Republic of Congo by three points, while Egypt are in control of their destiny.But other groups remain wide open with just the first-place finishers qualifying for Russia. Ivory Coast top Group C on seven points, but both Morocco (six) and Gabon (five) still harbour genuine hopes.It is a similar situation in Group D after FIFA's decision to annul South Africa's 2-1 win over Senegal from November 2016 -- a match manipulated by a Ghanaian referee. Burkina Faso and Cape Verde head the pool on six points, but Senegal trail by just a point with their match against Bafana Bafana to be replayed in November.Iran, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia will represent Asia in Russia next year, but Syria and Australia will attempt to join them via the play-offs.Syria prolonged their fairytale World Cup campaign with a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser in their final group match to set up a double-header against Australia on October 5 and 10.The Socceroos are bidding for a fourth straight finals appearance while Syria, who have never reached the World Cup before, have kept their dream alive despite the brutal civil war that has forced them to play all their home games abroad.They will take on Australia in Malaysia in the first leg before travelling to Sydney for the return. The winner of the tie will meet the fourth-placed team from CONCACAF with a spot in Russia at stake.Mexico will compete at their seventh straight World Cup next summer, with Costa Rica also on the verge of direct qualification. But a third automatic berth is still in play, while the fourth-placed side can also qualify through the inter-continental play-offs.Panama, in third, lead the United States and Honduras by a single point with two rounds of games still to play."

1581,"  LONDON: Pakistan’s military is intensifying security cooperation with Russia in a remarkable and historic turnaround for the two countries that for many decades considered each other rivals, leading British think-tank Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has said in an analytical report.The report said that since independence in 1947, Pakistan has been a frontline state for US dominance of the region and the US used Pakistan’s military and its airspace to monitor Soviet activity, but now as Pakistan marks its 70th year, there seems to be a strategic shift towards Russia by Pakistan’s military leadership.“This is a remarkable turnaround for two militaries that were virtually at war for many decades. It was in the 1980s that Pakistan’s enmity towards Russia peaked, and there were regular border skirmishes with the Pakistan Air Force shooting down a Russian intruder, piloted by a future vice-president of Russia, Alexandr Rutskoi.""“Ironically, the pilot who shot down the Russian fighter became the vice-chief of the Pakistan Air Force, and Air Marshal Athar Bukhari, now the incumbent Pakistani ambassador to Syria, has praised Russian air power in the Middle East,” noted the report.The main protagonists of this strategic turnaround have been the Pakistan Army and Air Force, starting in 2012, when the then chief of army staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani became the first military chief from Pakistan to visit Moscow.“The Pakistan Air Force, which has always been equipped with US fighters is now in consultation with an eye to buying the latest Russian aircraft. It has already signed deals on engineering procurement and Russian engines for its joint fighter produced with China, the JF-17,"" said the report. “It is no secret that the US has made it harder for Pakistan to buy its F-16s and military aid has been drastically cut in the past two years. Pakistan has, therefore, had to look to Turkey and Jordan for procuring used F-16s which are not quite the standard required to counter-balance the Indian Air Force,"" added the report. The RUSI report further said that Pakistan’s shifts comes in view of the almost monthly amendments and legislation on Capitol Hill in Washington against military sales to Pakistan which has prompted Islamabad to look elsewhere.“The Russians have stepped into the gap, providing military attack helicopters – a historic first, given Pakistani reliance on American aircraft for six decades. And the embrace is widening. Last year saw the first military drills between the Pakistani and Russian militaries. This was followed by the country’s special forces exercising in the Caucasus with Russia. The drills covered mountain warfare, countering urban terrorism and engaging in broader land warfare,” said the report.The report said that Kremlin is uneasy about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s deep embrace of the US and closer military ties with Washington. And, as the Indians now buy US and French fighters, Russia too is looking elsewhere, including Moscow’s participation in the alliance with China and Pakistan over rising tensions in Afghanistan and Central Asia, it said.The RUSI report noted that Russia’s strategic turnaround in Afghanistan has also been most remarkable as gone are the old zero-sum game theories applied to the Taliban and the fighters of the Northern Alliance, to be replaced by the courting of both Russia and Pakistan of the Taliban.The two militaries are cozying up and strategic objectives are aligning in the Middle East and Central Asia, it said.It also said that Pakistan Army Chief of Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s plans to visit Moscow as Russia bids to capitalise on a deteriorating relationship with the US.“US Secretary of Defense James Mattis arrives in Islamabad right on the heels of Bajwa’s Moscow visit and the Americans could have their work cut out. Rapprochement with Russia could be a sign of things to come, if the US keeps threatening the Pakistani military with sanctions and if Washington continues to stall military sales,” said the report."

That caused fumes,"" Pierre Meys, a spokesman for Brussels emergency services, told AFP. He said the symptoms included ""sore eyes and vomiting"".A European Council spokesman told AFP that 20 people were taken ill. Nine people were hospitalised and five were later released.""We continue to monitor closely the medical condition of the four contractual staff who remain under observation in hospital,"" the council said in a statement.The EU said that emergency services had ""determined that the problem was caused by a chemical reaction between two industrial cleaning products"" in the kitchen ventilator system.""We expect to re-open the Europa building on Monday. Meetings will resume as scheduled and our plans for next week´s European Council meeting remain unchanged,"" the statement said.The summit of 28 European Union leaders, which will have Brexit and the future of Europe on the menu, is scheduled for October 19-20.Staff from the Europa building were evacuated to the neighbouring Justus Lipsius building ""applying the principle of safety first"", the council added.Meys said ambulances were deployed as part of an ""emergency medical plan"" created by local authorities for any incident involving more than 10 people.The Europa building opened in January after a series of delays.It was commissioned in 2004 with a projected cost of 240 million euros but ended up costing 321 million euros in what officials said was a ""small over-run"".Designed by Belgian architect Philippe Samyn, it features a curved glass lantern-shaped structure inside a giant cube made of 3,750 recycled window frames sourced from across the 28-nation bloc."
1583,"LONDON: Dozens of prominent Pakistani figures “who reject the idea of permanent war with neighbouring countries” and do not accept what liberal Pakistanis consider an extremist orientation came together for the conference titled 'Pakistan- the way forward’.The conference was the second such organised under the banner of South Asians Against Terrorism and for Human Rights (SAATH). It was hosted by columnist Dr Mohammad Taqi and former ambassador of Pakistan to the United States, Husain Haqqani. ""Liberal, progressive, nationalist and secular visions of the country need to be reinstated in Pakistan's political arena if the country is to overcome the current local and international threats,"" Haqqani, one of the hosts, told Geo News. ""We must change the narrative that only religious extremists or intolerant bigots represent Pakistani patriotism. Pakistan belongs to various schools of thought, various ideologies and diverse opinions that’s its real beauty.""He maintained Pakistan faced critical challenges and needed a 360-degree change in policies — rather than gimmicks — and an alternative suggesting the way forward.Besides Haqqani and Taqi prominent participants included Rashed Rehman, Abbas Nasir, Senator Latif Afridi, Arif Jamal, Marvi Sirmed, Beena Sarwar, Atif Tauqeer, Farhat Taj and several leading journalists.Last year, the conference was marred by opinions of hard-line nationalists and supporters of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London’s leader Altaf Hussain. However, this time, the agenda and list of participants was more mainstream, organisers said.They added that the conference was themed with the purpose of creating a network of Pakistanis in the country and abroad who reject the idea of permanent war with neighbouring countries. While sharing their opinions, some experts said the conference should also explore and highlight issues of human rights and extremism in other parts of South Asia as the forum’s primary focus is the entire South Asian region.  "
1584,"LONDON: Drug use and drug dependence are known causes of premature deaths, with drug poisoning accounting for 16 percent of deaths among people in their 20s and 30s.“There were 3,744 drug poisoning deaths, involving both legal and illegal drugs in England and Wales, registered in 2016” revealed Office for National Statics (ONS) in a report.This is the highest number of deaths since comparable statistics began in 1993. A two percent increase was noted as opposed to 2013, according to the report.Drug-related deaths occur in a variety of circumstances, each with different social and policy implication.The number of deaths from heroin and morphine (473) are at the highest level since comparable records began in 1987.The report states that £10.7billion is the estimated social and economic cost of drug supply in organised crime in the UK. “On average in 2016, every five hours someone died after using heroin and/or morphine. It’s time for a radical solution,” the report urged.Report pointed out that use of drug slowly declined from 1993 to 2000, but in 2010 death rates started to rise sharply again.Statistics for England and Wales from the Ministry of Justice reveal that about 45,000 adult offenders were identified as drug users in 2010 to 2011.“Every drug overdose death is a tragedy and it has made it easier for addicts to receive naloxone, a medicine that reverses the effects of a heroin overdose,” report claimed, adding “the drugs are easy to buy in streets, one can get it from any back street in any colliery village, and the only problem is getting cash”.The government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) warned this year about funding of drug treatment falling.The ACMD said if resources were spread too thinly, there could be increased levels of blood-borne viruses, drug-related deaths and drug-driven crime.A local charity said that the heroin found on the streets of the UK in 2010 was low grade and had often been cut with other substances, such as paracetamol or caffeine.By 2014, the drug had reached 40 percent purity in some areas, while today purity levels are thought to occasionally be as high as 60 percent. This puts addicts at an increased risk of overdose.Stopping the problem at source seems to be near impossible, but is there a more radical solution?In a recent statement, Home Office said that any heroin or crack addict not in a treatment programme commits crime costing an average of £26,000 a year.The annual cost in England of looking after children of drug-addicted parents is more than £42 million.Authorities have claimed that there are high chances that heroin being sold in UK is coming from Afghanistan.UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said, in a report, Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin.“Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities. The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities.”The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine. However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade.The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye.The local government knew about his crop, but ""they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money.""The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54 percent of the entire national opium production.Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation.The region was a contested area between the Taliban and Nato-led forces, before the latter withdrew in 2014.Meanwhile, Lancet medical journal has updated the situation and says: Shortages of morphine and palliative care are leaving 25 million people a year dying in “horrendous and preventable pain” including millions of children, journal further says that some governments are gripped by an “opiophobia”, a fear that letting morphine into hospitals will lead to addiction in the community.In other countries cost is the main issue, or authorities are simply indifferent to the suffering of impoverished, terminally ill patients. Morphine can and should be made available for “pennies”,"
1585,"MEXICO CITY: A 5.4 magnitude quake struck southern Mexico on Friday, according to the US Geological Survey, but there were no immediate reports of damage.It was not immediately clear if the tremor was an aftershock from a powerful series of quakes last month that destroyed buildings in Mexico City and killed nearly 500 people.The epicentre of Friday’s tremor was just off the coast of Oaxaca state, in Mexico’s southwest, and it struck at a depth of 59.5 kilometres (37 miles), according to the USGS.An 8.1 magnitude earthquake struck Oaxaca on Sept. 7 near the town of Juchitan, flattening thousands of buildings in the humid market town.Fausto Lugo, Mexico City’s emergency services chief, said on local television that Friday’s earthquake was felt lightly in the capital, but there were no reports of damages."
1586,"DUBAI: Pakistani bowlers tore through the Sri Lankan batting order, taking the team to an 83-run victory in the first ODI at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.Hasan Ali and Rumman Raees spearheaded the Pakistani assault with their impressive performances, taking 3-36 and 3-49 respectively to restrict Sri Lanka to 209 in 50 overs.The victory was a good response by Pakistan after losing the preceding two-match Test series 2-0, in their first ODI since winning the Champions Trophy in England four months ago.Lahiru Thirimanne was the only Sri Lankan top-order batsman who played with any authority for his 53 as Pakistan took regular wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.Akila Dananjaya (50 not out) and Jeffrey Vandersay (25) delayed the result as they took Sri Lanka from 132-7 to 200-8 during their 68-run eighth-wicket stand but it was too little, too late.Earlier, Pakistan scored 292 for six in their 50 overs, led by a brilliant 103 by Babar Azam and helped by a quick-fire 81 off 61 by Shoaib Malik.Azam faced 131 deliveries for his sixth ODI hundred, as the pair added 139 for the fourth wicket after Sri Lanka had won the toss and opted to bowl first.Malik joined Azam at 124-3 and smashed five fours and two towering sixes before holing out at deep midwicket off the last ball of the 47th over.Azam completed his hundred off 128 balls in the next over with a single, but three runs later miscued a drive off paceman Suranga Lakmal, who finished with 2-47 from his ten overs.Azam managed a poor 38 runs in the preceding 2-0 Test-series defeat but batted with guts to prove his credentials as a limited-overs batsman.Pakistan got off to a poor start when opener Ahmed Shehzad fell for a 12-ball duck, caught off Lahiru Gamage in the fourth over of the innings.Fakhar Zaman and Azam took the total to 75 before Akila Dananjaya bowled the opener with a googly.The left-handed Zaman played well during his 45-ball 42 though, hitting four fours and a six.Pakistan are counting on a change in format and players to overcome a resurgent Sri Lanka in the five-match one-day series, after facing a 2-0 upset in the preceding Test series.But they are hoping to change their fortunes and carry the limited over form which helped them win the eight-nation Champions Trophy held in England in June this year.They only have skipper Sarfraz Ahmed, batsmen Haris Sohail and Babar Azam and fast bowler Hasan Ali from the Test series, while experienced all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez and opener Ahmed Shahzad amongst the 11 who joined the squad.Pakistan cricket team will face Sri Lanka in their first international cricket one day match after almost 4 monthsPakistan also have a young crop of fast emerging players in opener Fakhar Zaman -- who hit a century in the Champions Trophy final against India -- leg-spinner Shadab Khan, all-rounders Imad Wasim and Faheem Ashraf, and pacers Rumman Raees, Junaid Khan and Usman Shinwari.Spearhead Mohammad Amir was ruled out of the series with a shin injury sustained in the second Test in Dubai.Pakistan´s loss in the Test series was their first in United Arab Emirates in 10 attempts since they were forced to play at a neutral venue amidst security fears sparked after 2009 attacks on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore.But their one-day record in UAE has been abysmal, having lost nine of the 12 series since 2009, only winning twice against Sri Lanka and once against the West Indies.Sri Lanka have come from wretched one-day form, having lost 16 of their last 21 games, winning four with one no result. That included a 5-0 whitewash against South Africa and India and first-ever series defeat against minnows Zimbabwe.The remaining matches are in Abu Dhabi (16 and 18 October) and Sharjah (October 20 and 23).

In response, Washington had reportedly invited Asif for a meeting with Secretary Tillerson on October 4."

1590,"ABU DHABI: Wily left-arm spinner Rangana Herath was left delighted as he joined the 400-wicket club with a six-wicket haul that helped Sri Lanka to a narrow 21-run win over Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Monday.The 39-year-old finished with 6-43 -- 11-136 in the match -- to help Sri Lanka dismiss Pakistan for 114 after they were set a target of 136 to win on the fifth and final day at Sheikh Zayed Stadium.Herath´s dismissal of last batsman Mohammad Abbas was his 400th wicket in his 84th Test, becoming the 14th most successful bowler and fifth spinner in the five-day format to reach the milestone.He also completed 100 wickets against Pakistan in 20 Tests when he took the fifth wicket. He is the first bowler to take a century of wickets against Pakistan, beating Indian paceman Kapil Dev who fell one short with 99.Herath was delighted at reaching the milestone.""I´m so happy with the remarkable achievement of 400 wickets,"" said Herath after the match. ""All credit should go to the people behind me, from my parents to the team and the supporting staff.""Herath, who took 5-93 in Pakistan´s first innings of 422, admitted there was help from the pitch on which 16 wickets fell on the last day.""There was some assistance from the surface. There was something for the spinners so I got this success,"" he said.Herath took 23 wickets against Pakistan in 2014 -- a world record in a two-match series, and he said he had no clue why he was continually so successful against the nation.""I have no idea. I´ve played nearly 20 Tests, maybe that´s why,"" he said.He is the second Sri Lankan to take 400 or more wickets behind Muttiah Muralitharan who is the highest wicket taker in all Test cricket with 800.He also became the fourth fastest to the milestone behind Muralitharan (72 Tests), New Zealand´s Richard Hadlee (80 Tests) and South Africa Dale Steyn (80 Tests).The second Test -- a day night affair -- will start in Dubai from Friday."
1591,"WASHINGTON: Over 1.1 billion people mainly in Asia and Africa lack official proof of identity that would get them access to public health care, education and finance, according to the World Bank.More than a third of these ""invisible"" people are children, the Bank said in a report issued for its annual meeting in Washington this week.That is particularly hard on groups of people forcibly displaced by unrest and disasters.To address the problem, the World Bank has launched its ID4D programme to expand digital identification programs in ways that can help fight poverty.The poverty-fighting institution has digital identification and civil registration projects worth more than $500 million in more than a dozen countries.It says such programmes can also help governments decrease waste and boost innovation in delivering crucial services.""We are at an exciting point of technology, collaboration and commitment converging to make unprecedented improvements in the lives of the 1.1 billion people living without identification,"" said World Bank Group Chief Executive Kristalina Georgieva.ID4D advisory council member Eric Jing, CEO of China´s AliBaba group payment unit Ant Financial, added that ""families are left without access to health care, education and social and financial services."
1592,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump launched a tougher strategy to check Iran’s regime on Friday and warned that a landmark international nuclear deal could be terminated at any time.In a much-anticipated White House speech, Trump stopped short of withdrawing from the 2015 accord, but ""decertified"" his support for the agreement and left its fate in the hands of Congress.And, outlining the results of a review of efforts to counter Tehran´s ""aggression"" in a series of Middle East conflicts, Trump ordered tougher sanctions on Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps and on its ballistic missile program.Trump said the agreement, which defenders say was only ever meant to curtail Iran’s nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, had failed to address Iranian subversion in its region and its illegal missile program.The US president said he supports efforts in Congress to work on new measures to address these threats without immediately torpedoing the broader deal.""However, in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,"" Trump said, in a televised address from the Diplomatic Room of the White House.""It is under continuous review and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time,"" he warned.Simultaneously, the US Treasury said it had taken action against the Islamic Revolutionary Guards and added four companies that allegedly support the group to its sanctions list.Trump’s criticism of the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) -- the nuclear control accord reached between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- had raised global concerns.World governments feared any US move to sabotage the arrangement could dash Washington’s diplomatic credibility and relaunch Iran’s alleged quest for a nuclear weapon, in turn provoking a new Middle East arms race.But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson made clear ahead of the president’s speech that his decision does not necessarily mean an end to the accord.""The intent is that we will stay in the JCPOA, but the president is going to decertify,"" Tillerson said.""We’re saying, fine, they’re meeting the technical compliance,"" he said, indicating that the broader agreement would remain intact for now, and that US lawmakers will have an opportunity to revisit the US sanctions regime.Trump had repeatedly pledged to overturn one of his predecessor Barack Obama’s crowning foreign policy achievements, deriding it as ""the worst deal"" and one agreed to out of ""weakness.""The agreement stalled Iran’s nuclear program but opponents, and even some supporters, say it also prevented efforts to challenge Iranian influence across the Middle East.But since coming to office, Trump has faced intense lobbying from international allies and much of his own national security team, who argue the JCPOA should remain in place.Both the US government and UN nuclear inspectors say Iran is meeting the technical requirements of its side of the bargain, dramatically curtailing its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief.US concerns about the Guards could also weaken the deal. Trump stopped short of designating the powerful military faction a global terror organisation, as some hawks demanded, but his announcement of targeted sanctions is still likely to trigger an angry Iranian response.""We have considered that there are particular risks and complexities to designating an entire army, so to speak, of a country,"" Tillerson said.Instead the US will squeeze those directly supporting the corps’ “activities, whether it’s weapons exports or it’s weapons components, or cyber activity, or it’s movement of weapons and fighters around."" Still, Trump’s tough-guy approach could yet risk undoing years of careful diplomacy and increasing Middle East tensions.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani lashed out at his US counterpart saying he was opposing ""the whole world"" by trying to abandon the landmark nuclear agreement.""It will be absolutely clear which is the lawless government. It will be clear which country is respected by the nations of the world and global public opinion,"" he added. Congress must now decide whether to end the nuclear accord by ""snapping back"" sanctions, which Iran demanded be lifted in exchange for limiting uranium enrichment. Trump will not ask Congress to do that, Tillerson said. ""A re-imposition of the sanctions,"" he said, ""would, in effect, say we’re walking away from the deal.""But lawmakers may yet decide to torpedo the agreement. Proposals by Republican Senators Tom Cotton and Bob Corker to introduce ""trigger points"" for new sanctions and extend sanctions beyond a pre-agreed deadline have spooked allies, who believe it could breach the accord.But it remains unclear if their proposals can garner the 60 votes need to pass the Senate."
1593,"BARCELONA: Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde paid tribute on Friday to Lionel Messi’s “permanent competitiveness”, after the five-times world player of the year dragged Argentina into next year’s World Cup with a hat-trick against Ecuador last Tuesday.Messi has been in free-scoring form for his club this season, hitting 11 goals in seven Liga games and 14 in all competitions.On Saturday he faces one of his favourite opponents in Atletico Madrid, having scored 27 goals in 34 games against them, as Barca look to extend their 100 percent start to the league season.Tuesday’s talismanic display in the high altitude of Quito answered the surprisingly large number of critics Messi has in his home country, who have claimed that he does not replicate his performances for Barcelona when playing for Argentina.Valverde, however, said no-one at Barca has ever doubted their all-time top scorer.“If he has any critics they are few and far between, but when you see great things over and over again you stop being surprised,” the coach told a news conference on Friday.”Messi does what he did the other day (in Ecuador) permanently and we all expected him to deliver and he did. Most of all I‘m impressed with his permanent competitiveness and the responsibility he takes on his shoulders.“You know that he is capable of deciding every game on his own and he always tries to. He wears the tag of being the best player in the world but he doesn’t just carry it, he demonstrates it every single day. That takes a huge level of competitiveness.”Despite Messi’s record against Atletico, Valverde said he expected a typically tough game against Diego Simeone’s side as Barca aim to pick up an eighth consecutive Liga win and maintain their five-point lead at the top of the standings.“You always mark out the fixtures with Atletico on the calendar, they are always very important games, historically very close and you never know what could happen,” the coach said.”Atletico know how to make their goals count. They have their share of goalscorers but they are one of the hardest teams to score against.“It’s true we have got a good scoring record at the moment, but we know we’re facing an uncomfortable opponent. If they score first, it could cost us a lot to get back into the game, we’re very clear about that.”"
1594,"BRUSSELS: Military intervention against North Korea would have ""devastating consequences"", NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned Friday, after US President Donald Trump said diplomatic efforts had failed.Tensions over North Korea's weapons programmes have soared in recent months, with Pyongyang launching a flurry of missiles and conducting its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last month in defiance of international sanctions.Trump's continued threats of military action against Pyongyang to tame its weapons ambitions have fuelled fears of a conflict on the Korean peninsula and next week the US and South Korea will begin a major naval drill as a show of force against the North.Stoltenberg, who will visit South Korea and Japan in the coming weeks as a show of support, stressed that Washington had the right to defend itself and its allies, but called for greater diplomatic efforts.""The use of military force will have devastating consequences, I think nobody really wants that, therefore we need to continue to push for a negotiated solution,"" Stoltenberg said in an interview at NATO HQ in Brussels.""The US has the right to defend itself, to defend its allies, but at same time I am absolutely certain no one wants a military solution, so we still see a united effort to try to step up the pressure against North Korea.""Trump met his national security team on Tuesday and discussed a ""range of options"" to respond to Pyongyang's repeated recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests.The meeting came days after Trump, who last month threatened to ""destroy"" North Korea, said on Twitter that years of talks with Pyongyang had achieved nothing and ""only one thing will work"".Next week's naval drills in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea will feature the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier and two US destroyers alongside South Korean Navy vessels, part of a flurry of military hardware movement in the region in recent days.Earlier this week two supersonic US heavy bombers flew over the Korean peninsula, staging the first night-time joint aviation exercises with Japan and South Korea, the latest in a series of flyovers.NATO's covenant of self-defence, under which an attack on one member triggers a response from all, does not apply to South Korea or Japan despite their status as ""global partners"" and Stoltenberg stressed that NATO was ""not planning any military presence in that part of the world"".But he cautioned that a strike on Japan or South Korea would ""trigger a really dangerous situation, it would have catastrophic consequences"".And the growing range and accuracy seen in the North's missile tests have prompted the 29-nation alliance to review its missile defence system, which has been partially operational from a base in Romania since last year.""Our experts are working on technology, on how to improve our systems,"" Stoltenberg said.The North Korea crisis will be high on the agenda at a meeting of EU foreign minister next week, where a fresh package of sanctions against Kim Jong-Un's regime are set to be approved.Three individuals and six entities will be added to the blacklist, a senior EU official said, and the bloc plans to step up diplomatic pressure on countries who are not enforcing tough international sanctions against the North."
1595,"Chelsea midfielder N‘Golo Kante is facing nearly a month on the sidelines with a muscular injury he picked up during the international break, his manager Antonio Conte said ahead of Saturday’s Premier League trip to Crystal Palace.The France international limped off clutching his hamstring during last week’s 1-0 World Cup qualifying victory in Bulgaria and missed his country’s next game against Belarus on Tuesday.An initial scan suggested the 26-year-old would be out for up to 25 days, but Conte is hoping a second one will give him better news.”For sure it’s a muscular problem, a hamstring,“ Conte told a news conference on Friday. ”This is a big loss for us. You know very well the importance of N‘Golo Kante in our team. We don’t have another player with the same characteristics.“For this reason, we are going to do another scan after one week to understand the situation very well, and see if this scan is better than the scan before.”The champions, fourth in the table on 13 points after seven games, have league matches against Watford and Bournemouth, as well as a Champions League double-header with Roma and a League Cup clash with Everton this month.They face second-placed Manchester United on Nov. 5, and with Tiemoue Bakayoko and Cesc Fabregas the only specialist central midfielders available, Conte might have to turn to his defenders or younger players to step in for Kante.“We have to find different solutions in this period, to adapt some defenders in midfield, or give opportunities to young players like (Kyle) Scott or (Ethan) Ampadu,” he said.Striker Alvaro Morata is also out of the trip to Selhurst Park after injuring a hamstring in the 1-0 home defeat by Manchester City at the end of September, but could be back in time to face Roma on Wednesday.New signing Danny Drinkwater, who is yet to play for the club, is still out with a calf problem and Conte will be patient with the former Leicester City midfielder.“Drinkwater is progressing well but is not ready yet,” the Italian added. “We must have patience with him, with his calf problem.”"
1596,"The president of the United States Soccer Federation, Sunil Gulati, promised on Friday a “deep dive” review of their entire programme after the men’s national team hit an embarrassing low by failing to qualify for next year’s World Cup finals.Gulati, speaking three days after the US capped a lacklustre World Cup qualifying campaign with a stunning loss away at Trinidad and Tobago, said everything will be on the table during the extensive review.“It is something we do after every major competition whether we have been successful or not successful, or not lived up to what we had hoped,” Gulati said in a conference call.“This will obviously be a much deeper dive given that we haven’t qualified for the first time in 28 years, but we will look at everything.”A search for a new manager will be high on the to-do list since Bruce Arena, brought on last November to get the US team back on track, announced his resignation on Friday.But a new manager will just be the tip of the iceberg with Gulati, saying player development, coaching, refereeing and facilities are among a lengthy list of items being reviewed.“Where we need to make major changes we will do that. Where we need to make incremental changes we will do that. We will take our time with that and unfortunately we have the luxury of time before we have competitive games again,” said Gulati.“We will take a deep dive into that and we’ll probably get some external help so as to not be insular in how we look at these things. But basically everything will be looked at.”Gulati, who has held his role for three terms dating back to 2006, accepted responsibility for the team’s failure to secure a spot in Russia but said he has no plans to resign.The 58-year-old also did not say whether he would run for re-election when his term as president ends in February, but that he will make a decision in the coming weeks.Gulati said US Soccer conducted a review of governance and leadership in its staff two years ago and now plans to do it all over again, signalling what could be the start of a major shake-up in every section of the American game.Additional resources in technology and even the compensation structure of staff are all on the table.“We don’t have anything perfect here for sure in any of those areas,” said Gulati.“So any place we think we can get better and have outside people help us do that, we’re happy to look at that and we will continue to do that.”"
1597,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has re-elected former prime minister Nawaz Sharif as the party's president for a period of four years.The formal announcement was made at the party's general council meeting at Convention Centre, Islamabad by the PML-N's chief election commissioner Chaudhry Jaffar Iqbal. Nawaz has been elected unopposed as no one else contested against him. Earlier, during the intra-party election, Nawaz's nomination papers were submitted by State Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry. Senior PML-N leaders, including Nawaz, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif are present at the event. Party leaders are addressing the gathering of scores of party workers and leaders, after which Nawaz is expected to address the gathering. On Monday, the PML-N central working committee approved an amendment to the party’s constitution, paving Nawaz’s way to lead the party following his disqualification from the Supreme Court. As Nawaz was deemed not fit to be in Parliament, as per the country and party's laws, he also had to let go of his presidentship of the PML-N. However, according to the PML-N, the amendment to the party manifesto aims at getting rid of ‘dictator’s remnants’.In the meeting of the central working committee, headed by the party’s interim president Senator Sardar Yaqub Nasir at Punjab House, on Monday, the committee unanimously accepted the amendment. The party leaders expressed confidence and reaffirmed their trust on the party leader. They also paid tribute to the former prime minister for his services during his tenure.In its meeting headed by the party’s interim president Sardar Yaqub Nasir at Punjab House, the CWC unanimously accepted the amendmentThe intra-party election is being held after the National Assembly on Monday passed the Elections Bill 2017, paving way for former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to regain chairmanship of the ruling party.The bill was also ratified by President Mamnoon Hussain.A controversial clause in the bill — which was heavily criticised by the opposition — allows politicians disqualified from holding public office to lead political parties. "
1598,"DUBAI: Pakistani all-rounder Shoaib Malik on Friday expressed his wish to play in the ICC World Cup 2019.Malik's comments came after his tremendous innings when he secured 81 runs in 61 balls during the first one day international (ODI) against Sri Lanka — held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE).Pakistan on Friday thrashed the opposing team by 83 runs at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, with the famed cricketer getting named the 'Man of the Match' for his outstanding performance.Speaking to reporters after the match, Malik said he wanted to continue with his 'form-performance combo' in order to be able to play in the International Cricket Council's (ICC) mega event two years down the line.The cricket star retired from Test cricket back in 2015 after a faceoff with England in Sharjah, focusing only on shorter formats now.In response to a question by this correspondent, the Man of the Match noted that he took retirement as he wanted to leave space for youngsters in Test cricket format.""We all were surprised to be given batting first after having lost the toss,"" Malik said, before adding that Sri Lanka probably chose to do so after considering the ""dew factor for the second innings"".The veteran batsman struck his 40th half-century and 100th six in ODIs, making him the fifth Pakistani cricketer and the 32nd player — overall — to hit 100 sixes in this format.Here are the other four who have achieved this milestone earlier:The first ODI saw almost 45 percent of Dubai International Cricket Stadium filled up with spectators but Sri Lankans outnumbered Pakistani fans.More Sri Lankan flags could be seen in the crowd compared to those of Pakistan.Nevertheless, a festive mood prevailed as fans of cricket-loving nations were jubilant given brotherly ties between Sri Lanka and Pakistan."
1599,"WASHINGTON: Latin American and Caribbean governments need to crack down on corruption in order to make their economies more durable and the benefits of growth more widespread, the International Monetary Fund said Friday.High levels of corruption correlate with high inequality and weaker development, the Fund said in an assessment of the region's economic health.""Weak governance and entrenched corruption are weighing on inclusive and sustainable growth in Latin America and the Caribbean.""High levels of corruption appear to divide the emerging economies of the region from advanced economies which benefit from better rule of law, the report suggested.That is most noteworthy in Brazil, where huge graft scandals have brought down top politicians and added to the recent recession.The so-called Odebrecht scandal also contributed to Peru's slower growth last year, the Fund said.In the future, it said, ""Investment could be weaker than expected as uncertainties related to the Odebrecht corruption probe continue.""And Guatemala stands out in Central America with a rise in corruption scandals.The region needs to recognize that this — and its link to violence and weak rule of law — discourages investment and increases business costs, the Fund said.""With increasing public discontent, Latin America now faces a window of opportunity to curb corruption,"" the report said.Tackling it, the Fund admits, is a substantial political challenge, and requires a broad-based strategy.""Earlier experiences suggest that a successful anti-corruption strategy would entail strong political leadership, legal and judicial reforms, enhanced transparency and accountability, and above all, stronger monitoring and enforcement,"" it said."
1600,"Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero could be a surprise inclusion in their squad to face Stoke City in the Premier League on Saturday two weeks after breaking a rib in a car crash in Amsterdam, manager Pep Guardiola has said.The 29-year-old missed City’s 1-0 win over champions Chelsea and both of Argentina’s recent World Cup qualifiers but has returned to training with the Manchester club’s first team.Guardiola said Aguero, who has scored six goals in six league games this season, was not fully fit yet but the coach added that he was happy with the striker’s progress.”He did his first training session after what happened,“ Guardiola told a news conference on Friday. ”He did it quite well. Hopefully, as soon as possible he will be back.”Maybe (he can play against Stoke). Today, in the last training session, we are going to see. He is not 100 percent but he recovered quite well.“We will see. We are happy he is back in training.”“Back to training. I am ready!” Aguero said on his verified Twitter account, alongside pictures of him and his teammates in action during Thursday’s session.City will be without skipper Vincent Kompany, who is still recovering from a calf injury picked up playing for Belgium in August.“He is much, much better but still injured,” Guardiola added. “Hopefully, it is the last part. It depends on him when he will come back. He will notify us.”Premier League leaders City, with six wins and a draw, are looking to extend their unbeaten run, while visitors Stoke are 13th with eight points from seven games."
1601,"WASHINGTON: The Trump administration on Friday rejected a capital increase by the World Bank, which the Bank says is necessary to expand its global anti-poverty mission.The US Treasury Secretary said the huge Washington-based institution is inefficient and can be more effective in the nearly $60 billion in development finance it currently allocates each year.Through greater efficiency, the bank can internally build its capital base and expand lending without the need for more contributions from its 189 shareholder nations — of which the United States is the largest.He also said, in a statement to the Development Committee, which sets the action program for the bank and the International Monetary Fund, that the Bank needs to cut funding for emerging economies that don't need significant outside assistance.And he said that the bank needs more budget discipline, including controls on staff pay and benefits.""More capital is not the solution when existing capital is not allocated effectively. Demand for cheap capital will invariably exceed its supply — the key is to ensure that these resources are deployed where they are needed most and can achieve effective and sustainable results,"" Mnuchin said.Without naming any specific country, he suggested that those relatively strong and developed beneficiaries of the Bank's programs like China, which has over $3 trillion in foreign reserves, no longer need its support.""We want to see a significant shift in allocation of funding to support countries most in need of development finance, including through a credible application of the World Bank's graduation policy,"" he said.For wealthier borrowers, the Bank would be better sharing its expert knowledge rather than deploying development loans, he said.""While we appreciate the Bank's effort to curtail spending through its expenditure review, we see scope for further budget discipline, especially with respect to compensation and the Executive Board budget,"" he added.The statement rebuffed World Bank President Jim Yong Kim's plans to increase the Bank's capital resources, and came as the administration of President Donald Trump pulls back from global agreements in a number of areas.This week Trump announced the US pullout from Unesco, the United Nations educational and cultural agency. He has halted two major trade pacts and has forced the renegotiation of a third."
1602,"On Monday morning, Ahsan Iqbal, Pakistan’s minister of interior, was denied entry to the accountability court proceedings by the Rangers deployed at the court. To his credit, the interior minister spoke out immediately, decrying the obvious problem of a minister being barred from entering open court proceedings by members of a security force that report to the same ministry.Informal spokespersons of the military (there are thousands on social media and across the wide population of commentators in our blessed republic), immediately cited reports of court orders to bar open entry to the court as the basis for the denial of entry. But the accountability court judge has denied issuing such orders. The commissioner of Islamabad also denied asking the Rangers to restrict entry to the courts in his jurisdiction. And the interior minister has of course been emphatic that he knew of no plans to restrict entry to the proceedings of the court.Unless the guards posted at the court acted on the strength of their own conviction – which is unlikely, given how disciplined our military and paramilitary forces are – someone has acted to undermine the authority of the interior minister. Quite rightly, democrats in Pakistan are upset by this brazen stutter in the chain of command at the interior ministry. The question many are asking is: “Who is running this country?”Before we answer this, we should quickly examine the winners and losers from Rangers’ Gate. The military, always keen to put civilian leaders in their place, once again benefits from the demonstration of civilian impotence. It hardly matters whether a clever, scheming general or group of generals was behind Ahsan Iqbal’s denial of entry by the Rangers. What matters is that, when confronted, the civilian leader was reduced to complaining about his powerlessness on television. The military’s evolution into a modern war fighting machine, with great conviction about the power of psy-ops, means that such events – the reinforcement of its dominance in national affairs, and the corresponding helplessness of elected civilian leaders – are probably seen as victories well worth the cost of a handful of protesting tweets and op-eds.The PML-N, which is the closest proxy to elected civilian power in our country today, has once again leaned into what it believes to be a useful instrument in its fight for supremacy with the military. But this is a mistaken belief. Pakistan just had the best opening ten days of Muharram in recent memory, and the security with which Pakistanis walk their streets is largely credited to the military and its operations. We may be almost a year removed from #ThankYouRaheelSharif, but the bet here is that ordinary Pakistanis continue to thank the military for a safer Pakistan. A wartime military that has given thousands of soldiers in sacrifice to secure this safety is not a viable target for Nawaz Sharif and his lieutenants. The PML-N is not going to win a public diplomacy war against the military – even when the PML-N is 100 percent right and the military is 100 percent wrong.So Ahsan Iqbal may certainly have buttressed his credentials as a Nawazista outside the accountability courts in Islamabad, and he certainly won applause from business class democrats, including those writing op-eds in English language newspapers, but as victories go, he is playing one of the world’s smaller violins. The Pakistani street isn’t where Ahsan Iqbal or Nawaz Sharif need it to be.So who is in fact running this country? Of course, Rangers’ Gate did not happen in a vacuum. It happened at a court hearing for a disqualified former prime minister. The broader argument about whether Nawaz Sharif still owns the streets of Punjab as he did in 2013 is one that the PML-N and its opponents, principally the PTI, will have over the next several weeks and months. But three factors will weigh heavily on the outcome of that debate. The first is the extent to which the PML-N employs the civil-military imbalance as a tool to elicit support. As explained above, this tool is unlikely to work very well. Barring massive and sustained sets of miscalculations by the military, the audience for a critical narrative regarding the military is likely to be miniscule in Punjab.The second is clarity about a succession plan within the PML-N. Unlike third generation jiyalas in Sindh, the coalition of traders, working class urbanites and infrastructure democrats in Punjab that swept in the PML-N in 2013 is not immune to the news cycle. A struggle for the post-Nawaz Sharif leadership of the PML-N between Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif will force Noonies to choose sides. This erosion of coherence, even for a short period of time, alone could rend the ticket distribution for the PML-N to be a less than rational exercise. Punjab loves winners, and in-fighting for the throne in Raiwind is not the look of a winner. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the insidious emergence of a third force in Pakistani politics. Quietly, and without the fanfare that such a development should accompany, a trifecta of new right-wing political entities has landed as the main feature of the amuse-bouche to the 2018 election.In the 2013 election, the PML-N ran away with the Punjab Assembly. Out of 297 seats, it won 216. This margin is oft-cited as the foundation of an intergenerational dominance for the PML-N, which is partly why people like Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Hamza Shahbaz Sharif feel like they have something to fight for.The less heralded data from the 2013 election is that of the 297 seats contested in Punjab, the margin of victory was less than 10 percent of total votes cast in 129 seats.In NA-120, an intergenerational bastion for the PML-N, home constituency of the supposedly unassailable Nawaz Sharif, the combination of a new pro-Mumtaz Qadri political group, and the political wing of the LeT/JuD/FIF polled a total of 12,952 votes, out of a total of 125,129, or exactly 10.35 percent of the total votes cast in the NA-120 by-election.It is always too early to call curtains on Nawaz Sharif, a man who has survived coups, attempted coups, judicial interventions and all sorts of self-inflicted inanities and stupidities. But the factors precipitating his political decline are lining up faster than Shahbaz Sharif can build roads and metros. They are lining up fast and furious.There are those among us who believe that the military runs Pakistan. To the extent that it determines, without civilian input, how to handle the threat of an RSS-run India, or an India-run Afghanistan, this is hard to argue with. The military not only does not seek civilian input, it often seems to be at odds with stated civilian leaders’ goals for regional harmony. It is also true that the military can define the national story in Pakistan almost at will.But the emergence of the right-wing trifecta of Qadri-ists, Hafiz Saeedists, and a third generation of Sipah-e-Sahaba politicians strewn across the country, represents something decidedly more complex than anything the military or civilians – even working together – can easily manage or predict.The threat posed by the neo-right wing in Pakistan is not existential or even structural – yet. However, in NA-120 it has proven its potency as being far beyond what is widely recognised. Continued mistakes by the PML-N, continued behind-the-scenes efforts by those affiliated with the military to tar and feather elected leaders, and continued failure by the mainstream parties to devise a coherent narrative that appeals to ordinary Pakistanis, especially in the cities of Punjab represents a dangerous concoction. No matter who is seen to have won Rangers’ Gate on Monday, or Tuesday, or Wednesday, the longer-term threat to a still emerging democracy will make losers of all of us. Pakistan lost on Monday. And the leadership necessary to stem the losing seems non-existent. The RSS, and its proxies in Western capitals, are all licking their lips.The writer is an analyst and commentator.www.mosharrafzaidi.comThis article was originally published in The News"
1603,"KARACHI: Police said on Friday that the woman who was reportedly attacked by the knife attacker in the metropolis was infact injured in a traffic accident. However, a hospital report said the wound, a centimeter deep and just as much wide, was made by a sharp object. Hospital sources also said the incident did not appear to be an accident because there were no other injuries on the woman's body apart from the cut.Initially, after the incident, it was assumed that the woman was attacked by the knife attacker and he had enlarged his area of activity. The woman, domestic help by profession, was taken to the hospital by her employers who also registered a complaint with the police. The initial police report said the injury suffered by the woman was not inflicted by a sharp object. Police also recorded the woman's statement in a private hospital where she received medical aid. Since September 25, at least 16 attacks by a knife attacker, riding a motorcycle, have occurred in the city's eastern district. The suspect, who has posed quite a challenge to the authorities, remains at large, evading arrest and baffling authorities after a fresh spate of knife attacks on women, concentrated mainly in Gulistan-e-Jauhar and Gulshan-e-Iqbal areas."

1607,"Gucci, part of Paris-based luxury group Kering, has paraded models down the catwalk in luxurious fur coats in the past and creative director Alessandro Michele brought in loafers and sling-backs lined with kangaroo-fur two years ago.But the brand said it would now join an alliance of fur-free companies, adding it would sell off remaining accessories and clothing made with animal fur in a charity auction.Gucci has sold some of its mink fur coats for over $40,000.Marco Bizzarri, Gucci’s chief executive, said the brand would drop fur starting from its spring and summer 2018 collection and that its new approach had been agreed on with Michele.Gucci has enjoyed a revival under Michele, whose flamboyant, colorful designs have fueled sales over the past two years.Animal rights campaigners said they hoped the move by the Italian fashion house could have a knock-on effect, although it is far from the first label to stop using fur.“Gucci’s decision will radically change the future of fashion,” Simone Pavesi, manager of animal-free fashion at Italian campaign group LAV. “As fashion becomes more and more ethical, supply chains that revolve around animals will be a thing of the past.”In June, Yoox Net-A-Porter, a multi-brand online luxury retailer, adopted a fur-free policy on accessories and clothing sold on the site.Italy’s Giorgio Armani last year committed to stop using fur, saying technological progress meant there was no longer any justification for cruelty to animals, while U.S. brand Calvin Klein took the plunge in 1994.Anti-fur protesters have been known to demonstrate outside catwalk shows at fashion weeks around the world to call for an end to practices many see as cruel to animals, and luxury goods buyers - especially younger generations - have become more sensitive to environmental issues, too.Many labels and other luxury groups such as LVMH - owner of Louis Vuitton - are tightening their policies on how leather is sourced from tanneries and how they obtain furs, after a series of scandals over how animals are treated in breeding farms.France’s Hermes was caught in a storm two years ago when a crocodile farm used to supply leather for one of its best-selling handbags was accused of cruel slaughter practices."

1612,"SONOMA, CALIFORNIA: Firefighters face another round of dry, windy conditions on Friday as they battle wildfires that have killed at least 31 people in Northern California and left hundreds missing in the heart of wine country.The most lethal wildfire event in California’s history has killed people while they sleep in their beds and prompted authorities to evacuate thousands of residents, warning anyone deciding to wait it out: “You are on your own.”The toll from the more than 20 fires raging across eight counties could climb, with more than 400 people in Sonoma County alone still listed as missing.Winds of up to 60 mph (100 kph) and humidity of just 10 percent will create “critical fire weather conditions” and “contribute to extreme fire behavior” on Friday afternoon and into Saturday, the National Weather Service said.A force of 8,000 firefighters is working to reinforce and extend buffer lines across the region where the flames have scorched more than 190,000 acres (77,000 hectares), an area nearly the size of New York City.With 3,500 homes and businesses incinerated, the so-called North Bay fires have reduced whole neighborhoods in the city of Santa Rosa to smoldering ruins dotted with charred trees and burned-out cars.The cause of the disaster is under investigation, but officials said power lines toppled by gale-force winds on Sunday night may have sparked it.The Napa Valley town of Calistoga faces one of the biggest threats and its 5,000-plus residents were ordered from their homes as winds picked up and fire crept closer.Calistoga Mayor Chris Canning said anyone refusing to heed the mandatory evacuation would be left to fend for themselves if fire approached, warning on Thursday: “You are on your own.”Sonoma County accounted for 17 of the North Bay fatalities, all from the Tubbs fire, which now ranks as California’s deadliest single wildfire since 2003.Some people killed were asleep when flames engulfed their homes, fire officials said. Others had only minutes to escape as winds fanned fast-moving blazes.Mark Ghilarducci, state director of emergency services, said the loss of cell towers likely contributed to difficulties in warning residents.As many as 900 missing-person reports have been filed in Sonoma County and 437 have since turned up safe. It remains unclear how many of the 463 still unaccounted for are fire victims rather than evacuees who failed to alert authorities, Ghilarducci said.The fires struck the heart of the world-renowned wine-producing region, wreaking havoc on its tourist industry and damaging or destroying at least 13 Napa Valley wineries.California’s newly legalized marijuana industry also was hit hard, with at least 20 pot farms in Sonoma, Mendocino and Napa counties ravaged, said Hezekiah Allen, executive director of the California Growers Association."

1616,"At first, we thought we were lucky. Two Pakistani journalists handpicked to travel to Myanmar, to document and broadcast the exodus of the Rohingya refugees. We were not the first to go from Pakistan, but we were definitely among the select few. But, soon after arriving, the pride and self-confidence drained from our bodies and luck was nowhere to be found. Right from the start, cameraman Adnan Yahya Saeed and I knew that this would not be an easy task. Myanmar's Rakhine state was embroiled in violence, sending many poor Rohingya families to flee for safety. There seemed to be much panic and anger in the country we were walking in. I was even more cautious due to my past experiences. In 2013, I ended up in a Lebanon jail, albeit for a few hours, when caught using the banned Thuraya satellite phone. Then in Syria, we were interrogated for illegally recording in Homs, when we only had permission for Aleppo. Because of these experiences, when we hit the record button near the house of Myanmar’s de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi in Yangon, I was nervous. I soon realised that the feeling of foreboding wasn’t unreal. Back at the hotel, after the day’s shoot, the receptionist called us to the front counter and told us to leave immediately.“Why?” I asked after a short altercation.“A group has just booked all our rooms,” she replied coldly.But we had booked ours first. She wouldn’t budge and I was in a foreign country. There was no one we could seek out for help.So, we packed up and left. Saeed called our rent-a-car driver, Haroon, who understood a few words of Urdu, for suggestions on where to stay. When Haroon came, he dropped a bombshell on us. A Facebook post, he explained, was being shared since last night that accused us of attacking the Shwedagon Zedi Daw, a revered stupa in Yangon. Not only that but the Facebook account, Ko Ko Oo, claimed that we were in contact with Pakistan’s spy agency and the militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. The post detailed our passport information and our place of stay.We panicked and asked our driver to rush us to the Pakistan embassy. Pakistan’s Ambassador Dr Khalid Memon listened to our hurried monologue patiently before we asked his staff to translate the posts as well as the accompanying comments. The diplomatic staff at the embassy suspected that the passport leaks may have come from Myanmar’s intelligence agencies who have been obstructing journalists from reporting on the issue.We knew we had to leave as soon as possible. Until our flight back to Pakistan could be finalised, we took refuge in the embassy. The next day as we left for the airport, we noticed a large contingent of police officers deployed outside the building. Later, we were informed that the police were there in light of reports that some Buddhist groups were on their way to the embassy. When the plane finally took off, I looked out the window at the darkness beneath us. I had come here hoping to uncover the atrocities and report back; instead, I became the news myself."
1617,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistani Army said the captors of a US-Canadian family held by the Taliban fled on foot after troops shot at their vehicle's tyres, as it offered a fuller account Friday of the operation to rescue the hostages.American Caitlan Coleman and her Canadian husband Joshua Boyle, who were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 and had all three of their children in captivity, have left Pakistan after being freed, according to a US official.Pakistan has faced increased pressure from Washington to crack down on militant groups after it was lambasted by US President Donald Trump in August.Caitlan Coleman, her husband Joshua Boyle and their three children left via PIA flight: airport sourcesThe Army said it launched the rescue after a tip-off from US intelligence that the family had been moved into Pakistan’s semi-autonomous tribal areas from across the border in Afghanistan.Residents in the tribal districts of Kurram, where the operation took place, and North Waziristan told AFP they had seen drones flying in the skies above them for several days before the operation.Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Major General Asif Ghafoor said Pakistan was told by US intelligence at 4pm Wednesday that the hostages were on the move.""We sent our troops, traced the vehicle on the basis of intelligence sharing by 1900 hours on Wednesday and recovered the hostages,"" he said in televised comments late Thursday.The Army had planned to intercept the vehicle at a security checkpoint in Kurram tribal district, a security source told AFP - but the militants drove it off the road.Troops tried to stop the vehicle once it had travelled a few miles over the border. ""But when the militants refused to halt, they shot out its tyres,"" Ghafoor told AFP.The militants ""fled on foot"", leaving the family in the car, according to Ghafoor, who added that Pakistani soldiers had not wanted to risk injuring the hostages by firing on their fleeing captors.Late Thursday a US military official told AFP the couple was hesitating to board a US military jet in Pakistan over Boyle's concerns he could face American scrutiny over his previous marriage to the sister of a Guantanamo detainee.In 2009 he was briefly married to Zaynab Khadr, the sister of Canadian-born Omar Khadr, who spent a decade at Guantanamo.Canadian and US officials have said Boyle is not being investigated. A second US official confirmed the couple had left the country on condition of anonymity Friday afternoon, but gave no further details."
1618,"DHAKA: Pakistan and Japan played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in their Pool A encounter here at the Hero Asia Cup 2017 held at Maulana Bhashani National Hockey Stadium on Friday. Goals for Pakistan were scored by Mohammad Arslan Qadir (16’) and Mohammad Umar Bhutta (50’) while Kenta Tanaka (22’) and Heita Yoshihara (29’) scored for the Japanese.Both teams started the match aggressively as they looked to get the lead early on, however, the defence was solid in the first quarter for either team which saw them end the first quarter goalless. The second quarter saw three goals being scored as Pakistan were awarded a penalty corner in the 16th minute which was well converted through some lovely team-work. Captain Mohammad Irfan flicked the ball fiercely towards Mohammad Arslan Qadir, who then deflected the ball towards the goal to give Pakistan the lead.However, Japan made a comeback into the match as they produced two field goals to take a 2-1 lead going into half-time. First, it was Kenta Tanaka who scored Japan’s first goal of the match as he ran into the box with the ball, beat two defenders and shot at goal which was saved by Pakistan’s goalkeeper Mazhar Abbas, but Tanaka was quick to score off the rebound in the 22nd minute. The second goal for Japan was scored by Heita Yoshihara who picked up the ball on the right flank, cut inside and sent the ball past Pakistan’s goalkeeper Mazhar Abbas into the back of the net in the 29th minute.Japan showed good defensive skills in the third quarter to keep out Pakistan’s efforts of equalizing the score as the teams finished the third quarter with the score 2-1 in Japan’s favour. But it was the fourth quarter where Pakistan stepped up their attacking efforts as they looked to get the all-important equalizer.With 10 minutes remaining on the clock, Pakistan’s Mohammad Arslan Qadir picked up the ball and dribbled past the Japanese defenders parallel to the base-line and passed the ball in front of the goal which was tapped in by Mohammad Umar Bhutta in the 50th minute to equalize the scores at 2-2. Both the teams continued to put their opposition under pressure and put the defenders to test, however, neither team were able to make effective forays as the game ended in a 2-2 draw."

1621,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL: Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said on Tuesday that Kurds had voted “yes” to independence in a referendum held in defiance of the government in Baghdad and which had angered their neighbors and their US allies.The Kurds, who have ruled over an autonomous region within Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, consider Monday’s referendum to be an historic step in a generations-old quest for a state of their own.Iraq considers the vote unconstitutional, especially as it was held not only within the Kurdish region itself but also on disputed territory held by Kurds elsewhere in northern Iraq.The United States, major European countries and neighbors Turkey and Iran strongly opposed the decision to hold the referendum, which they described as destabilizing at a time when all sides are still fighting against Islamic State militants.In a televised address, Barzani said the “yes” vote had won and he called on Iraq’s central government in Baghdad to engage in “serious dialogue” instead of threatening the Kurdish Regional Government with sanctions.The Iraqi government earlier ruled out talks on Kurdish independence and Turkey threatened to impose a blockade.“We may face hardship but we will overcome,” Barzani said, calling on world powers “to respect the will of millions of people” who voted in the referendum.Earlier, the Kurdish Rudaw TV channel said an overwhelming majority, possibly over 90 percent, had voted “yes”. Final results are expected by Wednesday.Celebrations continued until the early hours of Tuesday in Erbil, capital of the Kurdish region, which was lit by fireworks and adorned with Kurdish red-white-green flags. People danced in the squares as convoys of cars drove around honking their horns.In ethnically mixed Kirkuk, where Arabs and Turkmen opposed the vote, authorities lifted an overnight curfew imposed to maintain control. Kirkuk, located atop huge oil resources, is outside the Kurdish region but controlled by Kurdish forces that occupied it in 2014 after driving out Islamic State fighters.In neighboring Iran, which also has a large Kurdish minority, thousands of Kurds marched in support of the referendum, defying a show of strength by Tehran which flew fighter jets over their areas.The referendum has fueled fears of a new regional conflict. Turkey, which has fought a Kurdish insurgency within its borders for decades, reiterated threats of economic and military retaliation.Barzani, who is president of the Kurdish Regional Government, has said the vote is not binding, but meant to provide a mandate for negotiations with Baghdad and neighboring countries over the peaceful secession of the region from Iraq.Baghdad said there would be no such talks.“We are not ready to discuss or have a dialogue about the results of the referendum because it is unconstitutional,” Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Monday night.Abadi ordered the Kurds to hand over control of their airports to the central government within three days or face an international embargo on flights.Abadi, a moderate from Iraq’s Shi‘ite Arab majority, is coming under pressure at home to take punitive measures against the Kurds. Hardline Iranian-backed Shi‘ite groups have threatened to march on Kirkuk.“We as Popular Mobilisation would be fully prepared to carry out orders from Abadi if he asks to liberate Kirkuk and the oilfields from the separatist militias,” said Hashim al-Mouasawi, a spokesman for the al-Nujabaa paramilitary group.The Kurds, who speak their own language related to Persian, were left without a state of their own when the Ottoman empire crumbled a century ago. Around 30 million are scattered in northern Iraq, southastern Turkey and parts of Syria and Iran.The autonomous region they control in Iraq is the closest the Kurds have come in modern times to a state. It has flourished, largely remaining at peace while the rest of Iraq has been in a continuous state of civil war for 14 years.Since the fall of Saddam, they have had to carefully balance their ambitions for full independence with the threat of a backlash from their neighbors and the reluctance of Washington to redraw borders.In the past four years they achieved a measure of economic independence by opening a route to sell oil through pipelines to a port in Turkey. But that still leaves them at the mercy of Ankara, which draws a firm line at formal independence.Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan warned that Iraqi Kurds would go hungry if Turkey imposed sanctions, and said military and economic measures could be used against them.“This referendum decision, which has been taken without any consultation, is treachery,” he said, repeating threats to cut off the pipeline.The Kurds say the referendum acknowledges their contribution in confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq.Voters were asked to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question: “Do you want the Kurdistan Region and Kurdistani areas outside the (Kurdistan) Region to become an independent country?”Iraqi soldiers joined Turkish troops for military exercises in southeast Turkey on Tuesday near the border with the Kurdistan region. Turkey also took the Rudaw TV channel off its satellite service TurkSat.Iraq’s Kurds have been close allies of the United States since Washington offered them protection from Saddam in 1991. But the United States has long encouraged the Kurds to avoid unilateral steps so as not to jeopardize the stability of Iraq or antagonize Turkey.The US State Department said it was “deeply disappointed” by the decision to conduct the referendum but Washington’s relationship with region’s people would not change.Asked about the referendum, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Monday: “We hope for a unified Iraq to annihilate ISIS (Islamic State) and certainly a unified Iraq to push back on Iran.”The European Union regretted that the Kurds had failed to heed its call not to hold the referendum and said Iraqi unity remained essential in facing the threat from Islamic State.The Kremlin said Moscow backed the territorial integrity of countries in the region. Unlike other powers, Russia had not directly called on the Kurds to cancel the referendum. Moscow has quietly pledged billions of dollars in investment in the past year, becoming the biggest funders of the Kurds.Iran banned flights to and from Kurdistan on Sunday, while Baghdad asked foreign countries to stop oil trading with the Kurdish region and demanded that the KRG hand over control of its international airports and border posts with Iran, Turkey and Syria.Iranian Major General Yahya Rahim Safavi, a top adviser to the Supreme Leader, called on “the four neighboring countries to block land borders” with the Iraqi Kurdish region, according to state news agency IRNA. Tehran supports Shi‘ite Muslim groups that are powerful in Baghdad.Syria, embroiled in a civil war and whose Kurds are pressing ahead with their own self-determination, also rejected the referendum.KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani said he hoped to maintain good relations with Turkey.“The referendum does not mean independence will happen tomorrow, nor are we redrawing borders,” he said in Erbil on Monday. “If the ‘yes’ vote wins, we will resolve our issues with Baghdad peacefully.”"

He is a quality stroke-player and we believe his game will suit the Australian pitches.""Foakes, widely regarded as one of the best keepers in county cricket, was included after scoring more than 680 runs in the Championship this season at an average of 45.33.In addition to Australian Bayliss´s regular staff, the England and Wales Cricket Board also announced Wednesday that former New Zealand paceman Shane Bond had been appointed as a fast-bowling consultant.England have a vacancy for a bowling coach after Ottis Gibson left to become the new head coach of South Africa and Bond will be with the squad up until the end of the second Test.Former England one-day captain Paul Collingwood, Stokes´s captain at Durham, will also take a coaching role during the Test series.England hold the Ashes after a 3-2 win on home soil in 2015.But their last tour of Australia saw them suffer a 5-0 Ashes defeat in 2013/14.Their last Test series triumph in Australia was in 2010/11 when Collingwood was a member of a side captained by current ECB England cricket director Andrew Strauss that won 3-1.England are due to travel to Australia on October 28, with the first of five Tests set to start in Brisbane on November 23."

1636,"SHANGHAI: Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer breezed into the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters on Thursday and Juan Martin del Potro defeated racquet-smashing Alexander Zverev.World number one Nadal blew away Fabio Fognini in 63 minutes and plays sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov as he pursues one of the few tournaments to have eluded him.Timeless rival Federer was even faster, dismissing Ukrainian qualifier Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-4, 6-2 in 61 minutes. The 31-year-old Spaniard Nadal, fresh off the back of triumphs at the US Open and China Open, anticipates a tough encounter against the Bulgarian Dimitrov.""I played a very good match, I don´t know how many mistakes I made, but very few,"" said the 16-time Grand Slam winner and top seed in Shanghai.""I have a tough match against Grigor and know I will have to play my best... but I am playing well.""Nadal, enjoying a late-career flourish, defeated good friend Dimitrov on his way to winning the China Open on Sunday, his sixth title of the season.And he underlined his status as the man to beat in Shanghai as he battered the Italian Fognini 6-3, 6-1.Dimitrov, chasing a spot at the season-ending ATP Finals in London, beat American Sam Querrey 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to set up a Chinese reunion with Nadal.Federer, the Swiss world number two, plays either of the Frenchmen Gilles Simon or Richard Gasquet in the last eight on Friday.A mouthwatering Nadal-Federer final on Sunday awaits if the celebrated pair continue at the current rate.Gutsy Del Potro recovered from a set down to win 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 against rising star Zverev and will next play Viktor Troicki or John Isner.The talented 20-year-old Zverev was going after his sixth title of a breakthrough season and was comfortable in the first set against Argentine Del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion and 16th seed.The German prodigy and the 29-year-old, whose career has been beset by injury, went toe to toe in the second set and the tie break was just as tight until Del Potro grabbed the crucial mini-break.And then came the turning point -- and a flash of anger from third seed Zverev -- as he yielded the crucial service break to go 3-2 down in the third set.""Right now I´m very pissed off, as you can probably tell,"" said Zverev afterwards, having smashed the racquet on the court, then trodden on it, and brutalised it further as he stomped back to his chair.A fan at least came away with a demolished racquet for a souvenir after the young German handed it to a spectator. ""I don´t understand how I can lose a match where I get broken one time in three sets and not managed to get any chances on his serve,"" said Zverev, who is tipped to one day make world number one.""I´m a bit pissed off because I feel like I played well and that´s the upsetting part of it -- I could have done great in this tournament.""Del Potro, pushed to the brink of retirement by four wrist surgeries that saw his ranking slip as low as 1,045 at one point in his career, said Zverev would learn.""I saw his frustration, for sure... But I think he´s still very young and he needs to keep learning, as he´s doing now,"" said the Argentine, 23 in the world.""He has everything to be in the top positions in the future, but these things happen.""Remember when Roger (Federer) was young? He broke racquets too.""Also through are fourth seed Marin Cilic and Spain´s Albert Ramos-Vinolas, they go head to head in the last eight."

1639,"KABUL: Civilian casualties from Afghan and American air strikes have risen more than 50 per cent since last year, the United Nations said on Thursday, as troops increase attacks on militants under a new strategy announced by US President Donald Trump in August.As of the end of September, at least 205 civilians had been killed and 261 wounded this year in air strikes in Afghanistan, UN investigators said in a quarterly report.At least 38pc of those casualties were caused by international military forces, while the majority were attributed to the Afghan Air Force, which has begun to conduct more attacks on its own.More than two thirds of the civilian victims were women and children, the report said.In September, US warplanes dropped more bombs than in any single month since 2010, driven largely by Trump’s strategy of trying to reassert pressure on militants after several years of draw-down by foreign troops.A spokesman for the US military command did not immediately comment on the report.General Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defence, rejected the findings and said the government took civilian casualties seriously.“It is quite obvious that Taliban and other insurgent groups cause more civilian casualties,” he said, adding that insurgents also “use civilians as human shields and hide in residential areas”.Overall civilian casualties decreased slightly compared to the same period last year, the report said.At least 2,640 civilians were killed and 5,379 injured this year, compared to 2,616 killed and 5,915 injured in the same period of 2016.The drop reflected fewer casualties from fighting in populated areas, the report noted, as militants failed to capture any major cities.The head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, Tadamichi Yamamoto, praised the Afghan government for formally endorsing a national policy designed to reduce civilian casualties.“The government owes it to its citizens, particularly the victims of the armed conflict, to ensure full implementation of the policy through a concrete action plan,” he said.Overall the UN attributed 64pc of civilian casualties to anti-government militants like the Taliban and Daesh.Pro-government forces were responsible for 20pc overall, while the remainder was attributed to joint fighting or unidentified groups, according to the UN."
1640,"KARACHI: Almost every second child in Pakistan grows up playing cricket at some stage, a large number of them dream to become a cricketer and represent the country, and most of them remain unable to achieve their dream, because they don’t have any platform to showcase their skills.For all such players, the PSL team Lahore Qalandars introduced a Rising Stars program, a platform where everyone can come and show what skills they’ve got.This year, during the 2nd edition of Rising Stars trials, around 160,000 aspiring Qalandars appeared with a dream to play cricket at top level.One of them was Mohammad Naved, an auto-rickshaw driver from Sargodha. Naved will now travel to Australia with Lahore Qalandars’ Rising Stars squad later this month.“It is like a dream come true for me,” Naved told Geo.tv.Naved represented Sargodha in the Rising Stars tournament and scored a match wining 67 in the final to get everyone’s attention.The opening batsman wasn’t picked for Sargodha’s original squad, but he kept trying.“I first appeared in Sargodha trials, but I wasn’t picked. Then I went to Layyah and Bahawalpur but was again turned down there,” he said.“Finally, I was picked in Faisalabad trials,” he said.But, he was sent back to represent his original city team when Sargodha lost some of the players after age verification process.For Naved, the Jazz Rising Stars program is a life changing moment. From driving rickshaw in Sargodha to play in top stadiums of Sydney is something which he always dreamt of.“I am thankful to Rana Fawad, Rana Atif and Aqib Javed for providing me this opportunity,” he said.Naved revealed that two of his brothers are auto-mechanics while one repairs bicycles.“My routine was to play cricket for few hours and then drive rickshaw to earn bread and butter for myself,” he said.“I didn’t let my circumstances demoralise me, I kept on practicing along with earning bread and butter for my family,” added the opening batsman. Lahore Qalandars’ CEO Rana Atif says that emergence of players like Naved who were nowhere before is an evidence that Lahore Qalandars is providing equal opportunity to everyone.“We provide equal opportunity to everyone. The only thing we see in a player is his potential, rest all is irrelevant,” Atif told Geo.tv.Aqib Javed, Pakistan’s former pacer and now Lahore Qalandars’ director of cricket operations, has termed Rising Stars program as an alternate options for all the players who are in oblivion for one reason or other.“See, regional teams are picked from selected players of club and department teams are also like that. So, not everyone gets the chance to appear at top forum,” Aqib said.“We provided a platform to players who are ignored by clubs, regions or departments to come and show what they have got,” the former bowler added.The platform provided by Lahore Qalandars proved to be a launch-pad for Muhammad Naved which took him from streets of Sargodha to grounds of Sydney."
1641,"DHAKA: Bangladesh has banned three Islamic charities from working with Rohingya refugees, a lawmaker said Thursday, amid concerns displaced Muslims in camps along its border could be radicalized.Mahjabeen Khaled, an MP from the ruling Awami League, said the international charities Muslim Aid and Islamic Relief, and Bangladesh-based Allama Fazlullah Foundation, had been blacklisted from the Rohingya refugee camps in southernmost Cox´s Bazar district.Khaled, who sits on the parliamentary standing committee on foreign affairs, said no specific allegations had been levelled at the charities. But authorities were ""scrutinising and screening"" all aid agencies wanting to contribute to the massive relief effort in Cox´s Bazar, where more than half a million refugees had fled to squalid camps since August.""We want to monitor who is giving aid, and why, for security reasons. Who are funding them, and what they are going to do with the money?"" Khaled told AFP.""They (Rohingya) are vulnerable. A lot can be done with this Rohingya people. We want to be careful,"" she said, adding it would be ""easy"" to lure the refugees to militancy.Waseem Ahmed, a director of Islamic Relief, said any allegations of misconduct by the charity were ""baseless and misguided"".""Since we are still awaiting approval from the government and haven´t started any projects yet in the camps, it would be completely unwarranted to tag us with any activities that we haven´t conducted,"" he said. Bangladesh has heavily curtailed access to the Rohingya camps in recent years, but eased restrictions last month after more than 520,000 new refugees poured across the border.The government´s NGO Affairs Bureau approved 30 local and global aid groups to meet ""emergency needs"" in the overwhelmed camps, which already housed about 300,000 Rohingya before the latest influx.Before that, just four international charities -- including Doctors With Borders (MSF) and Action Against Hunger (ACF) -- were permitted to operate in the sensitive border district.Khaled said Muslim Aid had also been banned from working in the refugee camps in 2012, when tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled a separate surge of violence in neighbouring Myanmar.Bangladesh authorities are reluctant to discuss their reasons for curbing access to the camps, but fears prevail that anger among the displaced Rohingya could be exploited by extremist networks.Bangladesh is fighting its own battle against homegrown extremists. Even those charities given the green light last month can only work for two months, and must restrict activities to providing healthcare, sanitation facilities and shelter for the Rohingya."

1645,"CAIRO: Rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement Thursday on ending a decade-long split following talks mediated by Egypt in Cairo, with president Mahmud Abbas calling it a ""final"" accord.Under the agreement, the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority is to resume full control of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip by December 1, according to a statement from Egypt's government.Abbas welcomed the deal in comments to AFP and said he considered it a ""final agreement to end the division"" -- though many details remain to be resolved and previous reconciliation attempts have repeatedly failed.It was signed in Cairo by new Hamas deputy leader Salah al-Aruri and Azzam al-Ahmad, the head of the Fatah delegation for the talks, at the headquarters of Egypt's intelligence service, which oversaw the negotiations.Celebrations broke out in the Gaza Strip after the announcement of the deal, with residents waving flags of Egypt, Palestine, Fatah and Hamas.Negotiations are now expected to be held on forming a unity government, with the various Palestinian political movements invited to another meeting in Cairo on November 21.An official from Abbas's Fatah movement said the Palestinian president was planning to soon travel to the Gaza Strip as part of the unity bid in what would be his first visit in a decade.Sanctions taken by Abbas against Hamas-controlled Gaza will also soon be lifted, the Fatah official said.The deal includes 3,000 members of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority's police force redeploying to Gaza, a member of the negotiating team told AFP on condition of anonymity.The figure is however a fraction of the more than 20,000 police officers employed separately by Hamas.Another party to the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agreement would see Palestinian Authority forces take control of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.One of the key issues has been punitive measures taken by Abbas against Gaza in recent months, including reducing electricity payments that left the territory's residents with only a few hours of power a day.""All the measures taken recently will end very shortly,"" Zakaria al-Agha, a senior Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip, told AFP.The two sides had been meeting in the Egyptian capital this week with the aim of ending the crippling decade-old split between the rival factions.Hamas seized Gaza from Fatah in a near civil war in 2007 and the two factions have been at loggerheads ever since.

1650,"Afghanistan Taliban has asked for removal of senior leaders from a United Nations blacklist, direct dialogue with the US and official recognition of a political office in Qatar, according to a Voice of America News report.According to Qatar-based Taliban spokesperson, Sohail Shaheen, the US invasion of Afghanistan and persisting presence of troops in the country are the root causes of the war.The demands put forth by the Afghanistan Taliban are pegged to be the initial steps to peacefully ending the civil war, according to Shaheen.Shaheen said the presence of the occupant forces is detrimental to Afghanistan’s sovereignty and the political landscape of the country.For the sake of peace the Taliban must be allowed to 'open an office' in Qatar and names of the senior members must be removed from the global organisation's list, he said.“That is why there is need for America and its allies to come to the table for direct talks with the Taliban for negotiating an end to the occupation,” Shaheen was quoted as saying.The controversial Taliban office was opened in Doha in 2013, but it wasn’t officially recognised and let to outrage by the Afghan government, which asked the Qatar government to shut it down. The office was used for holding dialogue between Afghan and foreign groups.  "
1651,"LONDON: A well-known international law specialist representing a central character in the money–laundering investigation linked with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) founder has said that the investigation remains “on-going” and all suspects, including the MQM leader and founder, remain “suspects”.In an exclusive interview, lawyer Toby Cadman said that he had been informed by a Scotland Yard officer, who has been in charge of the MQM money-laundering file, that “its an on-going investigation”. Toby Cadman spoke to Geo News outside the Charing Cross Police Station where he met the police and submitted the First Information Report (FIR) that has been registered by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in Karachi on the request of MQM leader’s former aide Sarfraz Merchant.Merchant was also accused of money-laundering for the MQM leader by the Metropolitan Police and remained on police bail along with the other leaders of the MQM.“It’s an ongoing investigation. I spoke to officer incharge of the case over the last couple of days and he has informed me that those who were suspects in the original money-laundering case remain suspects in the ongoing investigation. This morning, I have given to the police a copy of the FIA’s FIR and other documents related to the ongoing investigation involving Pakistani political party MQM and its leader. I am representing Mr. Sarfraz Merchant who recently got this case registered in Pakistan.”The Metropolitan Police announced in October 2016 that it had been advised by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to drop the money-laundering case as there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the suspects. However, Cadman said that what he has given to the police is fresh evidence showing the MQM founder’s involvement in money-laundering. “The matter wasn’t taken forward by the police previously because the Met police had considered that there isn’t enough evidence to prosecute, but we believe that that’s not the case and we believe there is sufficient evidence, the FIR details the evidence under the Proceeds of Crime Act in the UK.""""We will be working with the Met police to ensure that the investigation is taken forward and those who are responsible for criminal conduct are prosecuted,"" added the lawyer. He said the latest file presented to the police has “facts set out by his client Mr. Sarfraz Merchant. There’s proof of on-going cooperation between the UK and Pakistan and we will try to facilitate so that this matter is properly investigated and prosecuted”.Cadman also said there is a strong case for the prosecution in the MQM related money-laundering case but “whether that investigation takes place in the UK or Pakistan is a matter for the Pakistani and the British governments to consider”. However, Cadman said that the main suspect in the money-laundering case – MQM’s leader – is in the UK and resides here, “it's our position that there is a proper basis for him to be prosecuted in this country, there is a proper basis for him to be prosecuted in the UK”.The lawyer further said there is sufficient evidence in the money-laundering case and “if there is lack of evidence in the original filing then we will make sure that the authorities in this country – the police and the CPS – have all the information available to them which includes documentation, reports, video evidence and everything else which is relevant to different aspects of investigation.Answering a question about hate speeches made by the MQM founder from his base in London, Cadman hoped that Pakistan and the UK will cooperate in the hate speech matter as the CPS has asked for specific evidence from Pakistan recently. He said that the MQM leader has been involved in hate speeches and clear evidence exists of that. “There is certainly a basis for the speeches he has given, videos and words, there is certainly sufficient basis to charge him for incitement. Of course, it will be a matter for careful analysis for the prosecutors to determine if these speeches cross the threshold of criminal conduct over acts of incitement and violence. Our position, on the basis of what we have seen so far, is that there is sufficient evidence to investigate and potentially charge on that basis. Of course, that’s a matter for the Met police but we will provide them with detailed transcripts of all the speeches he has given to ensure that its properly investigated.”The lawyer said many people have been jailed in the UK for inciting violence and terror and the party founder's case is no different. “Comparing it to other cases that we have seen in the United Kingdom where individuals have been prosecuted for incitement and acts of terror, we have a number of cases that have been prosecuted in this country in relation to Syria, Iraq and elsewhere where individuals have pledged support to designated terrorist organisations so this is not a novel area of law, this is an aspect of criminal conduct in this country and that has a deep history so it’s really going to be matter of analysing the evidence that we can put to the Met police and of course we will cooperate with the Pakistani authorities in providing as much info as possible and that’s for the police and the Met to decide.Toby Cadman, who is working as Sarfraz Merchant's counsel, said that he was representing Merchant as he believed that his client is a victim. “My client filed the FIR in Pakistan. He was named as a suspect originally, he remains a suspect at this time but he is cooperating fully with authorities in Pakistan and the UK. He shouldn’t be considered a suspect but a victim, at no stage, has he engaged in criminal conduct and that’s the reason he has cooperated with authorities here and in Pakistan.”William Clegg QC had previously represented Sarfraz Merchant in the money-laundering case hearings at the Hammersmith Magistrate’s Court."
1652,"Bollywood's perfectionist Aamir Khan shared that he feared losing fans before signing his blockbuster hit Dangal. Khan shared that he predominantly got scared because of playing a character that was closer to his age than what his fans idolise him to be. ""I do get scared [of losing stardom]. When I heard the story of Dangal, I thought I have to do this film. But then I thought that I have just done Dhoom 3 and PK, and have six-packs and star-image."" He said, ""If I will do this film (Dangal), then I will become old and fat. What my fans will think? I hope I don't lose my fan-following,"" according to Indian media.""Mahavir is a 55-year-old in the film. I am 52. So, there is less difference between us. We are too close,"" he remarked. ""But fans don't know that as they see me as 30-year-old. So, I told the director that I liked the film and I will do it after 10 years when I will be old. They agreed to that too."" He added, ""But the story of the film couldn't leave my mind. So, I decided that I should do it and not get afraid of anything,"" he said.Dangal was based on the real-life story of a Haryana wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat who defied all odds to train his daughters Geeta and Babita. The daughters eventually became world-class wrestlers. During the shooting of the movie, Aamir underwent physical transformation to play a younger and older Mahavir Singh Phogat. The movie was awarded several Filmfare awards including the Best Actor and Best Director. The Dangal actor will be seen as a flamboyant music composer in his upcoming movie, Secret Superstar.'Secret Superstar' is set to release soon and stars Zaira Wasim, who plays a schoolgirl who defies her conservative Muslim family to pursue her dream of a singing careerRegarding his role, he claimed that there are “real people who exist” like his character, but he is nowhere close to him.“Why it is a tough role for me is because I have to feel like that character. When he is full of himself, I must feel ‘I am the best.’ It should come from within, which doesn’t normally come to me. I am always questioning my work.""He further said, “My natural instinct is to be critical of myself whereas this guy is not at all. He is sure that he is the best, no question about it.”  "

1654,"LONDON: Bitcoin smashed through the $5,000 barrier for the first time on Thursday, jumping as much as 8 percent on the day as investors shrugged off the latest warnings on the risks of buying into the booming cryptocurrency market.Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, has chalked up a more than fivefold increase in price this year.Typically for bitcoin, which at less than nine years old is still highly volatile and illiquid compared with traditional currencies and assets, the precise reason for its recent tear was unclear.Upcoming splits in its software, reports that Goldman Sachs is considering offering bitcoin trading, rumors that China could ease restrictions, and even a political crisis in Spain’s Catalonia region were all cited by market-watchers as reasons for the rally.But the main factor could simply be demand from investors wanting ‘in’ on a market that has provided gains exceeding those of any other currency in every year bar one since 2010.“People are just wanting to be part of it,” said Ryan Nettles, head of FX trading and market strategy at Swiss bank Swissquote, which launched bitcoin trading two months ago. Nettles said interest had been much higher than anticipated and has come from banks, hedge funds and brokers.“The interest really stems from the media hype,” he added.On Wednesday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned of the “serious risks” surrounding the nascent market, while Russia’s central bank said it would ban cryptocurrency trading websites.But that was not enough to put investors off, with bitcoin rallying around 10 percent since then.Data released last week from SEMrush, a search engine data analytics firm, found the price had a 91 percent correlation with Google searches on bitcoin, suggesting that all news -- whether negative or positive -- drives up demand, even if bad news can have a temporary negative effect.Bitcoin almost reached $5,000 at the start of September, but fell back sharply after the head of Goldman Sachs blasted the cryptocurrency as a “fraud” and as China forced exchanges to close down, sparking fears of a broader crackdown.But after dipping below $3,000 in mid-September, bitcoin has leapt in value by more than 75 percent in four weeks.“Bitcoin was designed to operate outside of the influence of governments and central banks, and is doing exactly that,” said Iqbal Gandham, Managing Director at retail trading app eToro, which has seen huge increases in cryptocurrency trading volumes.By 1245 GMT, bitcoin was trading up 8 percent on the day around $5,200 on Luxembourg-based exchange Bitstamp.Though there have been many warnings about a bitcoin “bubble”, including from European Central Bank Deputy Governor Vitor Constancio, some say it has much further to climb. But determining its value is difficult.“For most currencies there are several accepted methodologies for estimating relative value, normally based on macroeconomic fundamentals,” said EFG Asset Management’s Global Head of Research, Daniel Murray. “For bitcoin no such fundamentals exist.”Other cryptocurrencies -- whose prices tend to be highly correlated to bitcoin -- also rallied. Their total value -- or market capitalization -- climbed above $160 billion for the first time since early September, according to industry website Coinmarketcap.com.Two upcoming “forks” in the bitcoin software code, which will create rival clones of the cryptocurrency, were seen by some as a reason for the rise in price, which saw a boost after the “Bitcoin Cash” clone was created at the start of August.“Investors are seeing the lessons of history in the up-and-coming forks and hoping for an extra dividend,” said Charles Hayter, co-founder of data analysis website Cryptocompare, adding that rumors on online forums that China could reopen exchanges could also be affecting the price."
1655,"WASHINGTON: US President Barack Obama has said that despite being the President, even he faced racism during his two terms in the White House, US media reported.Speaking to CNN, Mr Obama asked: “Are there folks whose primary concern about me has been that I seem foreign - the other? Are those who champion the birther movement feeding off of bias? Absolutely.”Obama did not name the President-elect, but earlier in his election campaign Donald Trump reignited the birther movement and suggested the president’s Hawaii birth certificate was fraudulent.US President said that he did not see racism in the way he was treated in the mainstream, he was aware of it in the fringes.“I think there’s a reason attitudes about my presidency among whites in northern states are very different from whites in southern states,” he added.During the 2012 presidential election, Obama performed much better among whites in the North than in the South.While his national average among white voters was 39 per cent, he got just 15 percent of the white vote in Alabama, and just 10 percent in Mississippi, versus 48 percent in Wisconsin and 51 percent in Iowa.Former senior advisor of Obama David Axelrod said that It’s indisputable that there was a ferocity to the opposition and a lack of respect for Obama that was a function of race.He claimed that at least one powerful Republican was personally disrespectful to Obama.“He said to him, we don’t really think you should be here but the American people thought otherwise. So we’re going to have to work with you,” said Axelrod."

1661,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senator Pervaiz Rashid said Imran Khan had failed to prove his allegations against Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif in the Panama Papers case.Speaking at a press conference here he said Imran had levelled allegations of corruption and money laundering against the prime minister but he failed to present any evidence or witness in the court to substantiate them.“The evidence of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) comprised newspaper clippings and pages downloaded from the Internet”, he added.Pervaiz said the lawyers of Sharif family could have asked the Supreme Court to dismiss the false case and file a suit against Imran Khan for falsehood.“The PTI chief disrespected the Supreme Court judges”, he said adding that the office of prime minister was the most respectable and Imran Khan had made false accusations against the person of Nawaz Sharif.Pervaiz Rashid said Imran Khan had adopted a dictatorial attitude in the court.“He was acting like dictators who had dismissed judges and taken oath from them (judges) under the Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO)”, he added.He alleged that it had become clear that Imran Khan was lying as evident from changing his original stance in the case.“By adopting such behaviour Imran Khan tried to weaken the democratic system in the country”, he added.Pervaiz Rashid said had Imran Khan conscience he would have regretted the allegations levelled by him before the court.“He should have accepted that he had wasted the time of the court and people by filing a false case”, he added.He said when Imran Khan levelled allegations seven months back, the Prime Minister wrote a letter to the Supreme Court for the formation of a commission.“But the PTI did not let the government form the commission”, he added.He said even on the PTI’s demand the interior minister agreed for an investigation by the Federal Investigation Agency but Imran Khan again backtracked.“The PTI created hurdles in making of Terms of Reference (ToR) and boycotted the parliamentary committee which was reviewing legislation to change the law of inquiry commission”, he added.Pervaiz said the PML-N was clear that Nawaz Sharif and his family had committed nothing in violation of the law of Pakistan.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, he said, launched mega projects in the country and liberalised different sectors of the economy and all this was done in a transparent manner.“Pervez Musharraf and the two governments of Benazir Bhutto failed to find any corruption in the projects initiated by the governments of Nawaz Sharif”, he added.He said the people of Pakistan had seen the real face of Imran Khan and they would vote for the PML-N in next general election in 2018.Minister of State for Information Technology Anusha Rehman said Imran Khan was the king of U-turns as he had set the worst example in the Supreme Court by threatening not to accept the court verdict.“When the SC judges asked the PTI about forming of a commission its lead counsel Naeem Bukhari said the party would not accept the formation of a commission and if the court formed it the party would boycott the proceedings”, she added."

1663,"NEW DELHI: An Egyptian who is believed to be the world’s heaviest woman is to fly to India for weight reduction surgery after the country’s foreign minister personally intervened to secure her a visa.Indian surgeon Muffazal Lakdawala had offered to carry out the procedure free of charge after hearing about Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, who weighs around 500 kilogrammes (1,100 pounds).But her request for a visa was initially rejected, prompting Lakdawala to tweet a request for help to India’s foreign minister Sushma Swaraj.""She is a bundle of diseases. She needs surgery urgently,"" the surgeon said of Abd El Aty, 36, who is expected to fly to the western city of Mumbai next week for the procedure.""Her sister said she hasn’t left her room in 25 years. I just thought ‘Oh my god, I have to help. I’ll do it pro bono, no problem’.""Lakdawala said he was astonished when Swaraj, who is herself ill in hospital awaiting a liver transplant, replied to his plea within hours.Abd El Aty’s sister had approached him about two months ago, saying her sister needed urgent medical attention.Her family told the doctor that as a child she was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition that causes the limbs and other body parts to swell, leaving her almost immobile.Later she suffered a stroke and was rendered bedridden, triggering a series of ailments including diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension and sleep apnoea.Lakdawala, who has operated on government ministers in the past, said he was nervous but would do all he could to make Abd El Aty comfortable.""I would be lying if I said I was 100 percent confident. There are many challenges, but I will try my level best to help her,"" he told AFP by phone.Abd El Aty would need a couple of months in post-surgery care in India before heading back home in Egypt, he said.Bariatric surgery is essentially a stomach-shrinking bypass procedure carried out on those wanting to lose excessive weight.It is increasingly common in India, which has a growing problem with obesity, particularly in urban areas.India is a key destination for medical tourists because it offers quality services at a fraction of the cost of western countries and no waiting lists."
1664,"NEW YORK: Pop superstar Taylor Swift surprised fans Friday by releasing her first new music in two years -- an R&B-tinged duet with former One Direction member Zayn Malik.The track, ""I Don´t Wanna Live Forever,"" will be the theme song for ""Fifty Shades Darker,"" the sequel to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" that will hit theaters in February.The track, which immediately went to number one on the iTunes chart for most downloads, is Swift´s first song since her chart-topping 2014 album ""1989.""In contrast to the perky Nordic pop of ""1989,"" the new song has a sensual R&B feel as Zayn, mostly in falsetto, and Swift alternate verses about romantic longing over a stripped-down beat.The song is more in line with the recent style of Zayn, who has gone for a more sexualized image and R&B sound since leaving his squeaky clean British boy band last year. He has gone by just his first name as a solo artist.Swift´s collaboration with Zayn will be all the more intriguing to fans as she used to date his One Direction bandmate Harry Styles, who publicly fell out with Zayn.Swift´s ""1989"" was one of the top-selling albums in recent years and won the Grammy in February for Album of the Year.But Swift, who turns 27 next week, has been uncharacteristically quiet in recent months other than appearing in the celebrity press over her break-up with DJ Calvin Harris and her feud with rapper Kanye West over an unflattering song."
1665,"KARACHI: Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto on Friday gave a deadline for knowing the progress of the committee formed to implement the party's four demands from the government.Bilawal Bhutto said that the strategy for the anti-government campaign will be devised over the committee’s recommendations.The committee’s first session will be held on Tuesday in Islamabad, which will be presided over by former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani.The committee will present its report over the progress regarding the party’s demands on Dec 27, in a Central Executive Committee session.Bilawal called Panama Leaks case a litmus test against the government.Earlier in a statement on social media, he said that an implementation committee will present its report over the four demands he made in the CEC on December 27. He said that if the government fails to accept his demands, the PPP will hold protests in the parliament and even take to the streets.The PPP chairman during his address at Karsaz on October 17, made four demands from the government.1.       Parliamentary committee on national security be formed2.       PPP’s Panama bill should be passed3.       Asif Zardari’s resolution on CPEC should be implemented4.       A foreign minister should be appointed immediately "
1666,"When Sindh got its new chief minister, hopes were raised that there might be something done for the betterment of the people. However, this banner of Government Girls/Boys Degree College Kandhkot bursting with mistakes shows that betterment is probably not exactly in the minds of our rulers.See the banner for yourself:  Also, it is easy to assess the education standard of different colleges of Sindh only by looking at the terrible condition of the college.The province has seen many chief ministers over the years. However, no importance has been given to the education sector."
1667,"KABUL: Pentagon chief Ashton Carter sought to reaffirm US commitment to Afghanistan on Friday, as uncertainty lingers over President-elect Donald Trump´s strategy on America´s longest war in the face of a resilient Taliban insurgency.Carter met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and American troops on his last official trip to Afghanistan before he hands over the reins to Trump´s pick for defense secretary, the hardline retired general James Mattis.Carter´s surprise visit comes as concerns mount over growing insecurity in Afghanistan, where around 10,000 US troops are assisting struggling Afghan forces to combat a dogged Taliban insurgency along with Al-Qaeda and Islamic State militants. ""America is, and will remain, committed to a sovereign and secure Afghanistan,"" Carter told reporters at a joint press conference with Ghani.""We stand with the people of Afghanistan who have put themselves at risk and sacrificed so much."" Ghani thanked Carter for the US military support and the sacrifices of American troops in Afghanistan, even as uncertainty looms over Trump´s presidency.Trump has given surprisingly little details on his expected foreign policy, with even fewer specifics on how he will tackle the war in Afghanistan.Afghanistan got scarcely a passing mention in the bitterly contested US presidential election -- even though the situation in the conflict-torn country will be an urgent matter for the new president.The Taliban are ramping up nationwide attacks despite the onset of winter, when fighting usually ebbs, even as international efforts intensify to jumpstart peace talks.Fifteen years and hundreds of billions of dollars since the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the security situation in the country remains fraught and Afghan forces are struggling to contain the conflict.One of the most important questions facing Trump on Afghanistan is how many American troops will stay in the country, observers say.President Barack Obama was forced to slow a planned withdrawal of US troops in the face of Taliban gains, and about 8,400 will remain in the country when he leaves office early next year.Mattis, whose nicknames in the military include ""Mad Dog"" and the ""Warrior Monk"", has led troops in Afghanistan and has previously criticised Obama´s plan to pull forces from the country.Carter landed at Bagram Airfield, the largest US military base in Afghanistan, where four Americans were killed in a suicide bombing in November, in a major breach of security. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing inside the heavily fortified base, north of the capital Kabul, which left 16 other US service members and a Polish soldier wounded as the insurgents step up attacks on Western targets."

1669,"YANGON: Rohingya Muslims are not native to Myanmar, the army chief told the US ambassador in a meeting in which he apparently did not address accusations of abuses by his men and said media was complicit in exaggerating the number of refugees fleeing.Senior General Min Aung Hlaing gave his most extensive account of the Rohingya refugee crisis aimed at an international audience in the meeting with Ambassador Scot Marciel, according to a report posted on his Facebook page.The general is the most powerful person in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and his apparently uncompromising stance would indicate little sensitivity about the military’s image over a crisis that has drawn international condemnation and raised questions about a transition to democracy under Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.The military campaign is popular in Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged.Min Aung Hlaing, referring to Rohingya by the term “Bengali”, which they regard as derogatory, said British colonialists were responsible for the problem.“The Bengalis were not taken into the country by Myanmar, but by the colonialists,” he told Marciel, according to the account of the meeting posted on Thursday.“They are not the natives, and the records prove that they were not even called Rohingya but just Bengalis during the colonial period.”The UN human rights office said on Wednesday Myanmar security forces had brutally driven out half a million Rohingya from northern Rakhine state to Bangladesh, torching their homes, crops and villages to prevent them from returning.Coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on some 30 security posts on Aug. 25 sparked a ferocious military response.The UN rights office said in its report, based on 65 interviews with Rohingya who had arrived in Bangladesh, that abuses had begun before the Aug. 25 attacks and included killings, torture and rape of children.US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley last month denounced what she called a “brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority” and called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar until its military puts sufficient accountability measures in place.The European Union and the United States are considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders, officials familiar with the discussions said this week.Suu Kyi is due make a speech on television later on Thursday.She was swept into office last year after winning an election, but the military holds immense power, including exclusive say over security.UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra‘ad al-Hussein has described the government operations as “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” and said the action appeared to be “a cynical ploy to forcibly transfer large numbers of people without possibility of return”.Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to such accusations, according to the published account, but said the insurgents had killed 90 Hindus and 30 Rohingya linked to the government.Insurgents’ opposition to a citizenship verification campaign, which used the term Bengali, was behind the attacks, he said.“Local Bengalis were involved in the attacks under the leadership of ARSA. That is why they might have fled as they feel insecure,” he said, referring to the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army insurgents.“The native place of Bengalis is really Bengal,” he said. “They might have fled ... assuming that they would be safer there.”He said it was an exaggeration to say the number fleeing to Bangladesh was “very large” and there had been “instigation and propaganda by using the media from behind the scene”.He did not elaborate, or say how many people he thought had fled, but said the “real situation” had to be relayed to the international community.UN political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman is due to visit Myanmar on Friday.Min Aung Hlaing repeated a promise from Suu Kyi that refugees would be accepted back under an agreement with Bangladesh in the early 1990s, adding that details were being worked out.Many refugees doubt their chances of going home fearing they will not be able to prove their right to return."
1670,"Everything seems to be going wrong; the path of self-destruction that we took in the 1970s is not letting us avert the doom which now seems imminent. It is a total crisis and everybody is at war with everybody as we become more vulnerable to our suicidal temptations. Is this a revolutionary situation or an impending doom?New rounds of brinkmanship are setting the shape of things that may further deteriorate the conditions of our survival amid frantic calls to foil ‘foreign security threats’ and ‘internal enemies’. New clouds of uncertainty are emerging as we seem to be trying to play around our fault-lines with the same delusional mindset or tactical manoeuvres. Even though some of the indicators are self-explanatory, we are not inclined to act in a rational and objective manner.The subsidiary games that we played too long as a client state of the US are now boomeranging on our domineering national security structures in a reversed strategic environ. For too long we saw the Afghan Taliban leadership as an asset – at a very high cost for our own people and our soldiers in the hope of maintaining leverage in the post-war settlement in Afghanistan. This very strategic asset is now being seen by the US and Nato as “agents of chaos” being harboured by Pakistan. The tables were turned against us when India became a strategic partner in the coalition of forces holding seat of authority in Kabul (instead of the Taliban). And the TTP also got sanctuaries on the other side of the Durand Line.As the strategic environ turns hostile to us, we are again trying to mitigate it by some tactical appeasements. Our security paradigms have largely failed and we are averse to critical retrospection. Our so-called defence analysts are too busy selling phony justifications for our fatal blunders on the pretext of, as Gen Ehsan puts it: ‘that was right at that time, this [the policy today] is right now’. It means that the masters of our security were never wrong and whoever dares to disagree is an ‘enemy agent’. The chips will be down this very month or the next month about where we stand. The only option is ‘with us’ – and strictly on their terms.On the other hand, the World Bank, which we hate, is rightly cautioning against a brewing financial crisis on the external account that may lead to a state of insolvency by 2018-19. The current account deficit is going to climb up to $17 billion in this fiscal year. It is yet to be seen whether the Abbasi government will go to the IMF or leave it to an interim setup one doesn’t know about. It’s just not a fiscal or financial crisis that the IMF can help postpone. It is in fact a crisis of economic dependency of an unsustainable model of growth of a client state that nurses temptations of defiance while suspecting the whole world and fighting all its neighbours. Not just economics but political economy has pushed us on the path of a warrior state with a fragile economic base and disappropriation of its people. Certain leading economists are not ready to say all this in the face of the establishment – since they have always been a part of it.The political crisis created with the ouster of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has further deepened the conflict among the country’s institutions, despite a smooth change of government. Even though the Abbasi government is trying to observe the rules of governance, opposite pulls are keeping the kettle boiling. The smear campaign against politicians as a class, the PML-N and the PPP in particular, is now at its zenith with Imran Khan desperately trying to replace an assertive Nawaz Sharif as an establishment candidate. Parallel to the weakening and de-legitimisation of mainstream politicians, we are witnessing the mainstreaming of fringe extremist outfits as a counter-weight to liberal parliamentary forces.As the ‘deep state’ gets alarmed at the gathering storm of new security challenges, it seems to be worried by civilian disorder. It seems to be increasingly inclined to interfere in various spheres – from the economy to constitutional irritants and information to governance. The way the media has been influenced and the way politicians have been so maligned show how wonderfully the Pasha-Kayani model has worked to overwhelm the civilian setup. As things have not changed the way it was expected they would, despite the ouster of stubborn Nawaz Sharif, old and rotten technocratic recipes are being brought into the public discourse on a tamed and soulless media. In a recent television show, two retired generals and a brigadier were quite vocal in their impatience about the civilian disorder; one of them even shared the ‘good news’ of turning the page on prevalent politics “soon”.There cannot be a worse recipe than a so-called ‘technocrat government’ in these testing times of international isolation and near-insolvency. We have seen these kinds of shenanigans in the past and we have also seen their horrible consequences. The solution lies not in the overthrow of the representative system but in making the system work and letting the democratic transition move ahead. Unfortunately, politicians from across the opposition are too obsessed with expeditiously benefiting from the plight of former prime minister.As efforts are afoot to dislodge the former prime minister from Punjab and the PPP from Sindh, Imran Khan is trying to win the space as an alternative of the establishment – what Nawaz Sharif once was against Benazir Bhutto. Before losing his democratic credentials again, Khan must learn from the ouster of a popular prime minister that a popular leader like him cannot fit into the shoes of the establishment. Interestingly, its only Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari who are well aware of the ongoing game, with the latter trying to make his way through the political puzzle. But Zardari is trying to be too clever, and may eventually have to join hands with his adversaries to stop the democratic transition from being derailed again.This is a very complex and demanding situation. The major players in the power game must know that there are much greater restraints, which if crossed would hurt the country most. Are we actually clear about the extent of the ‘external threats’ and the nature of our ‘internal enemies’? Do we know the art of not increasing enemies while not clinging to those who are our real ‘internal enemies’? If not, then are we moving towards another disaster?If we go by our history, it may yet be another national catastrophe in making. This is also not a revolutionary situation that could have suited a revolutionary republican party – which is also not there. This is rather the coming of doom. I wish I am proven wrong."
1671,"Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif will be returning to the country later tonight and appear for his corruption hearing tomorrow, according to sources within the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. Nawaz, his daughter Maryam, and son-in-law MNA Capt (retd) Safdar are expected to be indicted by the accountability court hearing corruption cases against them. However, sources within the Sharif family said as of now there is no plan for Nawaz to return. On Tuesday, Nawaz requested people to pray for his wife, Kulsoom, who was undergoing her first chemotherapy session in London.Nawaz arrived in London on October 4 on the latest leg of his trip to tend to his wife, who was diagnosed with lymphoma (cancer of lymph nodes) by British doctors on August 22.Sharif, who first went to London on August 30, returned to the country on September 25 to face the Supreme Court-directed corruption cases against him.The hearing has been adjourned until Oct 13 when Nawaz, Maryam and Safdar are expected to be indictedAt the last hearing, on October 9, the accountability court approved the bail of Maryam and Safdar after they appeared in court.Judge Mohammad Bashir also approved the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB) plea to declare Nawaz's sons, Hasan and Hussain, proclaimed offenders and separated their proceedings in the three references filed against them. Their non-bailable arrest warrants, issued at the last hearing on October 2, remain in effect.The court also approved Nawaz's counsel Khawaja Harris's request to approve his client's exemption from appearance for that date only.The judge set October 13 (tomorrow) as the date on which Nawaz — regardless of his presence —, Maryam and Safdar will be indicted.Hasan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz are directed to appear before the court within 30 daysThe accountability court is hearing a total of three corruption cases against the Sharif family filed by NAB in light of the Supreme Court's judgment in the Panama Papers case.At the last hearing, the court also approved Maryam and Safdar's bail in the Avenfiled properties case and ordered them to submit surety bonds worth Rs5 million each. Safdar was also directed to take the court's permission before leaving the country from now on.

1674,"NEW DELHI: A top ICC official has urged cricket bodies around the world to follow Australia´s lead and dramatically raise wages for women´s players to stop them dropping out of the sport.Clare Connor, the former England captain who now heads the International Cricket Council´s women´s committee, told AFP that other countries must match Australia´s eight-fold increase in wages.""We are all going to think very seriously of how well our players are remunerated,"" she said in a phone interview.""Because if we don´t look after them they will go and choose other sports or other professions and that will be a tragedy.""The women´s World Cup this year won by England was hailed as a breakthrough for the women´s game, with full stadiums and high TV ratings around the globe.But many top players have said there has to be follow-up from the cricket hierarchy to acknowledge what is a growth area for the sport.Connor said higher pay was a key area for women´s cricket as it moves mainstream and generates increasing commercial opportunities.Cricket Australia´s new pay deal ensured a windfall for its women players, whose total payments have increased from $7.5 million to $55.2 million.India´s cricket board, the world´s richest, has also promised a salary increase for women players, but no details have been announced.""Obviously the men get in significant commercial revenues to the game,"" Connor said.""We are just starting out on our journey, hence there is a lot of discrepancy or difference how players are paid in various corners of the globe,"" she added. Tony Irish, chief executive of the international players´ association, also told The Guardian that the women´s game is at risk from match-fixers, who often prey on players on low pay.""They (Australia) are certainly setting the bar very high and this is a key issue for lots of countries. It is amazing that international women can earn that sort of money,"" Connor said.""(India) have got a team that has captured the imagination and they have obviously got huge number of girls that could be attracted to the game as a result,"" she added.India captain Mithali Raj, who became the top run-scorer in the women´s one-day game at the World Cup, is hoping the Board of Control for Cricket in India will make good on its pledge for higher pay.""Recently there was news that the BCCI is looking into it and we are hoping that it would be positive,"" the 34-year-old batswoman said.In what is now a packed women´s calendar, the second edition of the world championships started this week with a one-day series between West Indies and Sri Lanka.The world championships will act as qualifiers for the 2021 World Cup in New Zealand, while the women´s Twenty20 World Cup will take place in West Indies in November next year.Connor said the first world championships from 2014-2016 deserve ""great credit for a significant rise in performance standards that was on show in the women´s World Cup"".She added that ICC meetings in Auckland this week would ""look at the strategy for the women´s game to grow it and to ensure that we have got more competitive teams than just the strong top eight"".Surveys by the ICC have highlighted the growing popularity of the game and increased media coverage.""I think the right ambition is that it should be as easy or as accessible for a girl to pick up a cricket bat as it is for a boy to pick up a cricket bat,"" said Connor."
1675,"On World Teachers Day, some heartbreaking news reached us – the untimely passing away of Karachi University’s Department of International Relations’ professor Dr Sheikh Mutahir Ahmed who had spent 30 years of life at the campus.During his student life in KU, Dr Mutahir took an active part in the progressive students’ movement, and was once the president of the Democratic Students Federation (DSF). Dr Mutahir was very popular among the students because of the space he used to give his students. Unlike some dictators in the department, who needed a captive audience in the classroom, Dr Mutahir never imposed his ideas on his students and would stop and listen to them every time.Dr Mutahir’s passing away is a big loss for the Department of International Relations and for Karachi University. We need more teachers like him, whose teaching is not confined to textbooks but also includes frequent references to the changing socio-political situation in the country and regional and global changes. Dr Mutahir’s ideas were clear and bold. He would never impose his analysis on his students and would always encourage them to form their own opinions. He never considered his views to be the final authority. This was his key methodology of teaching, which helped generate a debate in the classroom and allowed students to exercise their right to question what has been told and taught.If freethinking is not tolerated at the campuses and young and bright minds are not given the opportunity to experience the courage to question, how will they broaden their understanding of a complex society and its contradiction and duplicities? Dr Mutahir often talked about his times at the university’s campus, the nature of student politics and the culture of debate. Karachi University had changed in the 1990s.A frequent wave of violence had gripped the city and fierce clashes among student groups, class boycotts and extremism had taken root. Civil strife in the city had affected academic life on campus. Dominant student groups would not tolerate new groups of student activists and many of us were denied the right to mobilise students on core political issues and ideological leanings. Fresh perspectives and progressive voices were not allowed to flourish on campus. Many of our friends were beaten by right-wing goons. The Rangers would not stop these coercive tactics.When progressive students organised events they had to face hurdles. Students who were studying about the Middle East or Eastern Europe would find it difficult to invite external speakers to sessions. Those who dared to take such initiatives had to bear in mind the consequences: the fear of being kidnapped and tortured, which many of them later went through as well. To say that there is freedom of activism in academic discourse would be false. Students were silenced and teachers would think several times before agreeing to their ideas.It was not the best of times at Karachi University. But teachers like Dr Mutahir and others provided their office space for discussions and debates, encouraged critical thinking and suggested books that students could read that were mostly outside the mainstream. These included the works of Edward Said, Eqbal Ahmad, Hamza Alavi, Dr Feroze Ahmad, Dr Mubarak Ali and Noam Chomsky – thinkers who viewed history and contemporary changes from a non-mainstream lens. If students are not introduced to these authors by their teachers, where else would they even hear their names?In the 1990s, the IR department was perhaps the only space – other than the Pakistan Area Study Centre – where weekly graduate study circles were a regular feature. Scholars, visiting academics, faculty and students would share their experiences of learning. From the Kalabagh Dam to the market economy, liberalisation and the new world order came under discussion and students were confronted with diverse views to frame their own worldview. The core values of freethinking and inclusive debates and a broader awareness of historical developments were imparted to students.We need such universities at this point. The shrinking spaces that were reserved for debate must be taken back if we are to grow as a society that encourages adults to seek the truth and believe in ideals rather than celebrate false and misleading “patriotism” and nationalism and defend failed policies.Around 10 years after our batch graduated in the aftermath of 9/11, Dr Mutahir would say that “universities are changing; one has to exercise self-censorship while teaching in class”. What he feared a decade ago we witnessed later on as the students of the university became victims of violent extremism and our alma mater started producing jihadis. The process of radicalisation created extremists who were willing to kill for a cause that they were told to believe in.The standards of teaching and the overall culture at universities have undergone a visible change in many parts of world over the past decade.Academic freedom is under compromise at Karachi University. Student hostels have been under the control of the Rangers for the past two decades. Student unions have been banned. Music concerts have been banned. As a result, a suffocating campus has become a reality. The campus environment will not change until the civil society and the city’s key political forces raise their voices. False notions of stability at the cost of student political activism and freedom have failed us and have only turned our vibrant campus into a nursery for nurturing fundamentalists.Dr Mutahir will be missed for his open-mindedness by hundreds of students. For many of us, he was the sole reason to go back to the department. With his departure, it feels as if our window to the campus has been closed."
1676,"SYDNEY: Test great Steve Waugh says England can´t win the Ashes without Ben Stokes and the bad boy allrounder would have been dumped immediately if he was Australian.England vice-captain Stokes was arrested last month in Britain on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and suspended from internationals until further notice following an apparent fight outside a nightclub.He was included in their Ashes squad but the England and Wales Cricket Board last week said he would not travel with the rest of the players when they leave on October 28.No final decision on his involvement has been made.Former Australian captain Waugh, at the helm in 57 Tests for 41 victories, said England will not be the same threat without Stokes.""If he doesn´t come, I don´t think they can win the Ashes,"" Waugh told Sky Sports Radio late Tuesday.While Stokes is yet to be charged, he remains under investigation, and Waugh hit out at England´s failure to immediately drop him from the Ashes squad.""I think if it was anyone in the Australian side, they wouldn´t be picked. You can´t do that these days in public. It just didn´t look good and it´s a bad image for the game,"" he said.""I think they (England selectors) are pretty keen for him to play in Australia... he´s probably their best player, so it would be a real shame if he´s not out here.""Stokes´ absence from the five-Test tour, starting in Brisbane on November 23, would be a huge blow for Ashes holders England, who have lost two out of their past three tours Down Under 5-0.He is an explosive middle-order batsman and a dangerous right-arm fast medium bowler, and not being in Australia will pile more pressure on the likes of the experienced Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson.""Without Ben Stokes, we´ll win,"" said Waugh. ""It´s too much pressure on Broad and Anderson, and they´re getting a bit older, and I can´t see them playing five Test matches straight.""I think Australia will win 3-1."""

The top three nationalities enrolled in pre-studies language courses are Chinese (27 percent), Brazilian (12 percent) and Colombian (8.7 percent)."

""People should be evacuated from dangerous areas, the safety of people and their belongings must be ensured,"" deputy prime minister Trinh Dinh Dung said on state-run Vietnam television. A terrified resident described severe flooding in another part of the province. ""The flash flood was terrible. Water poured down from the hill, like a surge three metres high. Traffic has been blocked because of the floods,"" Phan Ba Dien told state-controlled VNExpress news site. A journalist from Vietnam News Agency reporting on the storm was swept away along with four other people as an overflowing river demolished a bridge in northern Yen Bai province Wednesday.

1684,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) offered to hold talks with Iraqi authorities on the status of Kurdish airports, border posts and banks, on which they placed restrictions following an independence referendum.Baghdad took the measures in an attempt to isolate the KRG after last month’s referendum.The government in Baghdad, which declared the vote illegal, imposed a ban on direct international flights to the northern region. It also demanded that the KRG hand over control of its border posts, and stopped selling dollars to four Kurdish-owned banks.“To avoid this collective punishment, we invite (Iraqi Prime Minister) Haider al-Abadi, again, that we ready to any from of dialogue and negotiations in conformity with the Iraqi Constitution,” the KRG said a statement published overnight.It offered discussions “regarding the crossings, internal trade, providing services to the citizens, the banks and the airports.”The statement marked a change of tack by Kurdish authorities, which on Wednesday accused Iraqi forces and Iranian-trained Iraqi paramilitaries of “preparing a major attack” on the oil-rich region of Kirkuk and near Mosul in northern Iraq. An Iraqi military spokesman denied any attack on Kurdish forces was planned, saying government troops were preparing to oust Islamic State militants from an area near the Syrian border.Iraq’s Supreme Judicial Council issued arrest warrants on Wednesday for the chairman of the Kurdish referendum commission and two aides for “violating a valid (Iraqi) court ruling” banning the independence vote as against the Constitution.Neighboring Iran and Turkey back Iraq’s uncompromising stance, fearing the spread of separatism to their own Kurdish populations.Kirkuk, a Kurdish-held multi-ethnic region, has emerged as a flashpoint in the crisis between Baghdad and Erbil as it is claimed by both sides.Iraqi forces and Shi‘ite paramilitaries, known as Popular Mobilisation, are deployed south and west of Kirkuk, in areas previously under the control of Islamic State.The area around the border post of al-Qaim, in western Iraq, is the last Iraqi region still under the control of the militants who overran a third of the country in 2014."

1687,"ISLAMABAD: The military’s investigators have not found any involvement of the Chottu gang in terrorism activities, officials said on Sunday, bursting a bubble that created a hysteria across the Punjab earlier this year.Rather, both the army and police investigations revealed that Chottu is only one of the many gangsters operating along the 100-mile stretch of River Indus in Punjab and Kashmore in neighbouring Sindh.“We did not find any link of Chottu with hostile intelligence agencies. We neither found any of his links with Baloch separatist groups nor with any big political party. He is a hardcore criminal, but not a jet-black terrorist,” revealed a top police officer who has been involved in the investigation of Ghulam Rasool alias Chottu.“With no terrorism record his (Chottu’s) case might not being recommended for military court,” revealed a police officer who was part of Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed on direction of Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif. The JIT report, through inspector general police, would be forwarded to the chief minister this month.Law enforcement agencies’ investigation, also shared with The News, revealed that military in its long investigation did not find solid evidence of Chottu gang’s involvement in unrest of Balochistan. Neither members of this gang had been in contact with proscribed organisations in south Punjab nor they did any plan to sabotage multibillion dollars costly project -- China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), revealed the investigation.Punjab police registered 96 first information reports (FIRs) against Chottu and investigators said half of them were found genuine so far. This correspondent spoke to some senior officials in Lahore and Rawalpindi on this issue to gather details on this investigation. However, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR), when approached for updates on Chottu gang, did not offer any official comment. Police officers, however, told The News that Chottu had been used by politically influential local landowners who were accused of paying off both the police and the bandits to protect their own interests.A senior regional police officer also revealed that there is more pressing need to keep an eye on remaining gangsters operating along Indus Highway who otherwise are big threat to security of foreigners who will be working on the CPEC’s proposed route to connect north-western China with the Pakistani port of Gwadar.Dera Ghazi Khan’s divisional police are investigating around 40 top criminals having affiliation with many notorious gangs which operate in small islands surrounded by areas named Kacha Umrani, Bakhrani, Changwani, Kajlani, Kacha Jamal, Kacha More and Kacha Shah Wali. The Chottu gang generally sought refuge in the 40 kilometre dense forest area by the Indus River in Rajanpur where the gangsters had been securing themselves in a 10km land strip at Kacha Jamal. Around 16 criminals of Chottu gang are in various jails of Dera Ghazi Khan, investigators said. Those who are under investigation in various murder cases are: Ghulam Rasool alias Chottu, Bhola Bakhrani, Bashir Bakhrani, Razzaq Bakhrani, Rasheed Bakhrani, Din Bakhrani, Nazar Ali Bakhrani, Behram Ahmed, Mahi Khan, Haider Bakhrani, Ishaq Changwani, Akram Eindhar, Boota Bakhrani, Majeed Bhatti and Khalid Gajlani. They all are crime partners with Chottu and accordingly were investigated by the military, senior police officers told The News.“Kacha once remained a safe haven for all kinds of gangsters -- but people found relief after destruction of these gangs, Chottu in particular,” commented Captain (R) Atta who also headed JIT in this case. Additional Inspector General Police Arif Nawaz also confirmed to The News that “Chottu is not a terrorist -- this is what investigation suggested so far.” He also revealed that Chottu had no link with Indian premier spy agency -- RAW and they also did not find his nexus with Baloch Liberation Army and Baloch Liberation Front. Investigators, however, revealed that they are still investigating that either Chottu had been committing crimes with support of local politicians belonging to Gorchani, Mazari, Leghari or any other tribe in the area. “We are also still investigating Chottu gang for its involvement in serious crimes in bordering areas of Sindh and Baluchistan where gangsters executed murders, kidnapping for ransom, robbery and theft, also in inter-districts like Rahim Yar Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Hasilpur, Muzaffargarh and Bahawalpur,” he said.The investigation further revealed that Chottu had committed some 11 murders in Rajanpur, two murders each in Rahim Yar Khan and Muzaffargarh and one in Ghotki, Sindh. More than two dozen FIRs have been registered against him in Rahim Yar Khan while over a dozen FIRs have been registered against him in Sindh at various police stations. First FIR was registered against Chottu in 1987 at Bhong Police Station in Rahim Yar Khan and the latest FIR was registered against him under section 302/324/395/353/186/148/149PPC-7-ATA ¾ EXP in Rajanpur before he with his partners surrendered before the military. The JIT also recommend empowering police operating in these areas, equipping personnel with moderate weapons to deal with such gangsters. —Originally published in The News  "
1688,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued on Thursday non-bailable arrest warrants of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in relation to a contempt of court case against him.The five-member ECP, bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Justice (retd) Sardar Raza Khan, heard the case. The ECP ordered the police to arrest Imran and present him before the commission on October 26.However, the PTI has said it will challenge the decision in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).Imran Khan should show that he respects the institutions, said the opposition leader Addressing the media, PTI's Babar Awan said the ECP has issued a non-bailable warrant in a case where a bailable warrant has already been dismissed by the IHC. Moreover, the petitioner in the case, Akbar Babar, said Imran challenges the authority of every institution that takes action against him. He said Imran cast aspersions against a constitutional body. At the last hearing, on September 27, the ECP had adjourned the case until the IHC decides on the party's petition regarding the proceedings.The CEC had observed that it will issue its order in the contempt case if the IHC does not decide the case on October 11.At the previous hearing on September 25, the PTI chief, in his reply submitted through his lawyer Babar Awan, stated that ""I respect the ECP and believe in the supremacy of institutions.""Khan stated that he confirms the apology tendered by his previous counsel, Saqlain Haider, regarding the ""contemptuous"" remarks, adding that the contempt of court matter is a ""closed transaction belonging to the past.""The PTI chief's counsel then requested the ECP to withdraw the show-cause notice issued on September 24.On September 14, the ECP had issued bailable warrants against Imran to ensure his presence in the case.PTI chief was directed at last hearing to submit response to fresh contempt petitionThe ECP had ordered Imran to submit a surety bond of Rs100,000 until September 25 and nominate two persons who would ensure payment of the amount and be held responsible otherwise.Imran was also ordered to appear on that day in the commission in person.However, the PTI approached the IHC which, on September 20, suspended the bailable arrest warrants. Hearing the case, Justice Aamer Farooq, who headed a three-member larger bench, directed the PTI chief to reply to the ECP's show-cause notice.Babar Awan assured the court that the PTI chairman would reply to the ECP's show-cause notice with regards to contempt proceedings against him.The ECP had issued the contempt notice to Khan on January 24 over his “scandalous remarks” about the commission.Babar, the petitioner who had filed the foreign funding case against the PTI leadership, had informed the ECP that the PTI chief had accused it of being biased in the foreign funding case following which his counsel tendered an apology with the commission.Babar is also one of the founding members of the PTI. Several times since then, Imran has accused the ECP, among other government bodies, of being compromised and working for the benefit of Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister and head of the ruling party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. "
1689,"DHAKA: A man who was dining in a Dhaka cafe when it was attacked by militants and who was later detained as a suspect has been acquitted of terrorism charges and released on bail, police said on Sunday.Tahmid Hasib Khan, 22, was at the Holey Artisan Bakery on the evening of July 1 when it was stormed by militants, beginning a 12-hour siege in which 20 hostages, mostly foreigners, two police officers and six suspected attackers died.In video footage filmed by witnesses and militants, Khan appeared holding a pistol and talking to the hostage-takers, but police said forensic analysis had shown the Toronto University student had been forced to do so.Based on these findings and there being no witnesses or other evidence of Khan's involvement in the attack, a court in Dhaka had acquitted him, Masudur Rahman, spokesman of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police told Reuters.Khan is the second person to be released without charge in an investigation that has led to only seven arrests, leading to criticism of the police by some newspapers and social media.The cafe attack was the worst in a recent escalation of violence by militants in Bangladesh that has included a rise in killings of liberals and religious minorities in the mostly Muslim nation of 160 million.Although Al Qaeda and Daesh have been making competing claims of responsibility, the government has dismissed suggestions that Daesh has a presence in Bangladesh, even though 'selfies' of some of the attackers posing with an automatic rifle were posted on the jihadi group's propaganda outlets during the siege.Khan's case, and that of another man, Hasnat Karim, who has British and Bangladeshi dual citizenship, has also drawn criticism from human rights groups who say they were illegally detained and denied access to a lawyer.Karim and Khan were among 32 survivors rescued by police and taken into custody for questioning. Karim, a 47-year-old engineer, was at the cafe with his family to celebrate his daughter's 13th birthday."

1691,"The power struggle in the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) has deepened as old friends become hostile rivals. This struggle can even take an 'ugly turn' in the coming months as both factions, in Pakistan and in London, are not ready to surrender the ownership of the MQM, which will play a key role in the next general elections.Following the policy of 'tit for tat', both factions have left their supporters worried, disappointed, and disillusioned. ""Are we going to see another deadly fight, the one which even continues today between MQM and MQM-Haqiqi, killing hundreds of workers on both sides,' asked one of the MQM elders. As things are getting tense between the two, MQM Pakistan and Dr Farooq Sattar have become even more unacceptable to London than Pak Sarzameen Party, as Mustafa Kamal had formed a new party while Sattar and his team sacked the pre-August 22 high command.Things may not be easy for either of the factions as not only their other political opponents but also the establishment would be watching and monitoring this internal conflict closely. As far as MQM's alleged militants are concerned, it may further speed up in the coming weeks. Already over 4,000 of their workers accused in cases of target killings and extortion are facing cases.As this fight is likely to intensify, MQM Pakistan will face a tough challenge in the by-elections on one of its National Assembly seats vacated as a result of the resignation of Asif Hasnain, who had joined Pak Sarzameen Party.MQM Pakistan would be fighting against all odds: MQM-Haqiqi, PSP, and MQM-London in particular. Though, PSP and London would not be participating but in the present scenario could approach voters through underground means against Farooq Sattar's nominee.In his latest move on Sunday, MQM London convener Nadeem Nusrat ended Dr Farooq Sattar's basic membership from the party, 24 hours after MQM Pakistan nominated Sattar as the new convener, Aamir Khan as the Senior Deputy Convener, and named Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and senior members like Ms Kishawar Zehra, Ms Nasreen Jalil, and Faisal Sabzwari in the Rabita Committee.Two important names missing from the list were that of Saleem Shahzad, who although is in London but extended support to MQM Pakistan, and that of Ms Zareen Majeed, a founding member who is said to be in Canada.  On the other hand, Nadeem Nusrat also made in what he has termed as a 'last chance' for MQM MNAs, MPAs, and senators to resign and send written apologies to London. The message came after Altaf Hussain's ""audio message"", the authenticity of which has been questioned by a former MQM MPA.So, it would be interesting to see as how many legislators would respond to the second appeal in 10 days and what action MQM London would take against them. They may suspend members of all those who stood with Farooq Sattar and could even sack them.The difficulties which MQM London would be facing are in the formation of a new set-up and even if they did what will its future be, particularly in the elections. MQM Pakistan is registered with the Election Commission of Pakistan which recognises Dr Farooq Sattar and not Nadeem Nusrat.Secondly, in the post-August 22 scenario MQM London would also find it extremely difficult to organise any on-ground setup as even those who have approached London are not ready to come on the surface.Nadeem Nusrat and his team would be disappointed if they fail in getting resignations of 30 to 40 per cent legislators. Another setback which London received was yet another resolution against Altaf Hussain, moved by the MQM, in the inaugural session of the KMC. Jailed Mayor Waseem Akhtar, despite a favorable statement from London for his release, decided to stand with Sattar.MQM London at present is trying to reach the sectors and units with a message to get ready for the line of action.However, despite the disputed 'audio message' of Altaf Hussain, the most significant development is his mysterious silence. He has not only stopped making speeches in Pakistan but also abroad after two of his speeches in America and South Africa caused him a lot of trouble.The MQM Pakistan leadership knows the challenges ahead and now comes with an experienced team and, in case ailing Saleem Shahzad also joins its ranks followed by Haider Abbas Rizvi, they would at least have a presentable team.MQM Senior Deputy Convener Aamir Khan has the reputation of an effective organiser and when he had returned to the party after breaking ties with Afaq Ahmad, there was a lot of opposition from the former MQM leader Anis Qaimkhani group.Aamir Khan has got the task of looking after sectors and units, key to the party's organisation, beside other party wings.Fear still persists within MQM Pakistan over the possible reaction or action from London if it fails to get 10-20 resignations.But London will be announcing a new interim setup in Pakistan in the next few weeks, depending on the developments and the ground situation. Some Altaf followers even hinted towards 'guerrilla warfare'. Now, whether they have expressed their personal opinion or some serious work is going on, no one knows.What Farooq Sattar has so far succeeded in maintaining is his cool and calm. He will be seeking cooperation from Islamabad in order to get some relief for those workers who are not involved in any heinous crimes.MQM Pakistan is deeply concerned about not getting any relief for Mayor Waseem Akhtar whose work is now being looked after by Acting Mayor Arshad Vohra.While MQM Pakistan got moral and political support from Interior Minister Ch. Nisar Ali Khan and others in the federal government, it has not even succeeded in resuming formal talks with Chief Minister Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah, which were suspended after August 22 anti-Pakistan speech of Altaf Hussain.If Dr Sattar and his team fails in getting any relief, either from Sindh or the Center or even from the establishment, at least those workers in jail may look for other options: PSP or the extreme option of MQM London.He will also be getting bad news in the next few days from Rangers, which may further increase pressure on him.For London, activities openly in support of Altaf would be highly risky. Now, will any of the London leaders, other than Altaf Hussain, take the risk of coming to Pakistan for re-organisation? It looks very difficult without their presence in Pakistan.As it stands today, Dr Sattar has succeeded in keeping the situation under control and kept the organisation intact, but with lots of 'ifs and buts' as he is facing enormous pressure.At the same time, Nadeem Nusrat and the London faction would be more frustrated if it gets little or no response on his appeal after Altaf's video also got little response.Depending on the national political scene, we may see some more developments, both in London and in Pakistan, in the power struggle in a party which was once known for its organisation and discipline.This situation has also opened a space for other parties as well, but they too are waiting for the final show-down. —The writer is a senior columnist and analyst of Geo, The News and Jang. "

But what I hear from people on the ground is that the number of dead is more than one hundred,"" said Gudina.Sunday’s event quickly degenerated into violence, with protesters throwing stones and bottles and security forces responding with baton charges and tear gas grenades, with some reports of gunfire.‘Days of rage’The police action sent people fleeing in panic with many falling on top of each other into a ditch.Police demanded that AFP’s photographer leave the scene, where rubber bullets were seen strewn on the ground.Oromo activists called for ""five days of rage"" to protest the deaths while a strong police presence was visible as the news of the day’s events spread.""This government is a dictatorship, there is no equality or freedom of speech. There is only TPLF. That’s why we must protest today,"" said Mohamed Jafar, referring to the Tigrayan People’s Liberation Front.In 1991 the TPLF, then a rebel group, overthrew Mengistu Haile Mariam’s dictatorship and now, as a political party stands accused of monopolising power.Every year millions of people in the Oromo region mark the Irreecha festival on the shores of Lake Harsadi, which they consider sacred.The anti-government protests started in the central and western Oromo region in 2015 and spread in recent months to the northern Amhara region.""For the last 25 years the Oromo people have been marginalised in many things. Today we come together as one to chant for our freedom,"" said one of the people at the festival, Habte Bulcha.Together, Oromos and Amharas make up 60 percent of the population of the Horn of Africa nation and have become increasingly vocal in rejecting what they see as the disproportionate power wielded by the northern Tigrean minority in government and the security forces."
1694,"KARACHI: Former West Indies great Sir Andy Roberts has suggested Pakistan Cricket team to play more cricket outside UAE as it is not helping Pakistan Cricket due to batting friendly surfaces.Talking exclusively to Geo News in Karachi, the fiery bowler of his era stated that Pakistani cricketers are good in Test Cricket, but they need to get more experience in ODIs around the world and country’s limited overs’ bowling needs to be improved.“It is no good to be playing in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, where pitches suit all the batsmen. This is where Pakistan Cricket is lacking, their bowling is not what it should be in ODIs,” said the former West Indian great when asked about his views on Pakistan’s not-so-good position in ODI rankings. He added that Pakistani players aren’t playing in IPL, and their participation is very much limited in other leagues around the world, which is not allowing Pakistani players to gain proper experience of limited over Cricket. The former West Indies bowler also spoke about Pakistan’s left-arm bowler Mohammad Amir and advised him to concentrate on improving his performance by continuing the hard work.“It is not easy for him as he’s making a comeback after five years, he is very good bowler and only 24 years of age, so he has a long way to go,” he said of Amir.“All he needs to do is bowl as much as he can,” he said. Sir Roberts is in Karachi for a talent hunt program by Karachi Sports Foundation, where he – along with Danny Morrison, Damien Martyn and Jonty Rhodes – will unearth a group of cricketers for further training.He says he’s “amazed” to see the raw talent available in Pakistan.“There is a young bowler, who is just 16 and he is very good talent,” he said about bowlers he spotted in the program.“It amazes me to see some of the players who haven’t played at any level, all they need is proper guidance to make it to international Cricket. I have always known that Pakistan is a country with so much of talent, big question is if somebody is there to pick that talent up,” he said. When asked what his advice would be to the young bowlers, he replied, “hard work and commitment.”“Don’t get carried away with your early success,” he added.The Antigua-based legend also spoke about the change in Cricket rules which has made it more difficult for bowlers, especially the fast bowlers, to show their skills. “Cricket has become the batsmen’s game, all the rule changes are affecting bowlers, in particular the fast bowlers,” he said. He also rued lack of practice opportunity being given to the fast bowlers by the coaching and training staff, which according to him is not allowing fast bowlers to prepare according to requirements. “We must allow bowlers to be themselves, we must not tell bowlers that you can’t bowl more than four overs in practice when you’re required to bowl 20-25 overs a day. How can you do that if you are not trained to do that?""“Bowlers aren’t to be blamed, lack of commitment is by coaches and trainers who want to limit the amount or preparation these guys can do,” he added.Talking about West Indies, the former great said that he’s grieved to see the way West Indies have been performing recently and blamed players for the lack of success.“Lots of things have hurt West Indies cricket, one thing in particular is that the love for the game is not what it was before. We in the past strived to be successful, and now everybody wants to secure their financial future,” he said.“A combination of both, players and administration,” he said when asked whom he would hold responsible for the status of the West Indies team after the World Cup. “I won’t blame the administration for what is happening in WI cricket, I will blame the players for lack of success because they’re the ones who need to improve themselves to stay on top of the world,” he said."
1695,"SHARJAH: Fast-rising Babar Azam cracked a second successive hundred to guide Pakistan to a dominant 59-run win over the West Indies in the second one-day international in Sharjah, gaining an unbeatable 2-0 lead in three-match series.Azam’s brilliant 126-ball 123 formed the cornerstone of Pakistan’s imposing 337-5 which also featured half-centuries from Shoaib Malik and Sarfraz Ahmed.West Indies finished on 278-7 from their 50 overs with Darren Bravo hitting 61 and Marlon Samuels scoring 57.The final match will be in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.""It was a wonderful team effort,"" said Pakistan captain Azhar Ali.""We needed a good partnership after losing two early wickets and Azam and Malik gave that to us with pace and wisdom.""West Indian captain Jason Holder rued his team’s bad bowling.""I think we didn’t bowl as well as we would have wanted and in the end 330-plus was too much for us,"" said Holder.West Indies needed to improve on their best chase of 285 against Pakistan which came in 1993 at this same venue, but Pakistan’s varied attack kept them at bay.Bravo added 89 for the second wicket with Kraigg Brathwaite (39) after Johnson Charles was removed for two in the second over by Mohammad Amir.Bravo hit three towering sixes and five boundaries off 74 balls before he was smartly run out by paceman Hasan Ali who knocked over the stumps at the non-striker’s end after the batsman aimed for a quick single.Samuels also tried his best during his 52-ball 57, spiced with four boundaries and two sixes, and added 67 for the fourth wicket with Denesh Ramdin (34) before fiery pace bowler Wahab Riaz (2-48) removed both in successive overs.Kieron Pollard, playing his 100th one-day international, made 22 and Holder, who scored 31 not out, found the going tough as West Indies needed 121 in the last 10 overs and 87 in last five.Earlier Azam anchored Pakistan’s highest one-day total against the West Indies, beating the 307-8 they made at Perth nine years ago.Azam added 169 for the third wicket with Malik who missed his ninth one-day hundred by 10 runs, scoring an attractive 84-ball 90 with six hits over the fence and three boundaries.It was another dominating batting display by Pakistan, with Azam and Malik shredding the West Indian bowling at will, and Sarfraz Ahmed finishing it with 47-ball 60 not out.Azam reached his second one-day international hundred with a single off Carlos Brathwaite, waving his bat and bowing down in delight.He was finally caught off paceman Alzarri Joseph at long-on in the 46th over.Malik was also ruthless as he reached his 38th half-century off 55 balls before hitting three successive sixes off left-arm spinner Sulieman Benn, one went out of the Sharjah stadium.Azam and Malik steadied the innings after openers Ali (nine) and Sharjeel Khan (24) fell in the space of three deliveries with the total at 40.Ahmed, who hit seven fours, helped Azam add another 73 for the fourth wicket as Pakistan added 97 in the last ten overs and 55 in the last five.Joseph and Holder took two wickets apiece."
1696,"ISLAMABAD: Advisor to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs Sartaj Aziz confirmed that a contact was established between National Security Advisors of India and Pakistan, after recent tension between both countries on Line of Control (LoC).Sartaj Aziz said that Lieutenant General (retd) Nasir Khan Janjua and Ajit Doval agreed to reduce tensions on LoC. He said that India wants to divert world’s attention from Occupied Kashmir by escalating tensions.“Pakistan wants to reduce tensions on LoC and focus on Kashmir”, he added.Talking about Prime Minister’s recent US visit, he said that Nawaz Sharif had explained to the world leaders that incidents of border tensions would continue between both countries without the resolution of Kashmir dispute.Two Pakistani soldiers embraced martyrdom on Thursday when Indian forces resorted to unprovoked firing across the Line of Control (LoC) on Thursday morning.The unprovoked fire was painted as a ‘surgical strike’ by senior Indian officials, in a move apparently aimed to satisfy the public.Pakistan rebuffed the claims with the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) saying, ""There has been no surgical strike by India, instead there had been cross-border fire initiated and conducted by Indian forces which is an existential phenomenon"".Indian forces resorted to unprovoked firing across the LoC on Saturday morning as well.On both occasion, Pakistan Army befittingly responded to Indian provocation, silencing the guns of the enemy.Of late, tensions soared high between the two nuclear-armed adversaries over occupied Kashmir and an attack on Indian army's brigade headquarters in Uri, which left 18 soldiers dead."
1697,"Pope Francis said on Sunday that homosexuals and transsexuals should be treated with respect but that teaching gender theory is unacceptable ""indoctrination"" of young people.""When a person (who is gay) arrives before Jesus, Jesus certainly will not say, 'Go away because you are homosexual,'"" Francis said.The pope made his comments in the latest wide-ranging and freewheeling conversation with reporters aboard the plane returning from a foreign trip.The pope, who made headlines on his first trip in 2013 when he uttered his now-famous phrase ""Who am I to judge?"" about homosexuals, spoke in answer to a question about a comment he made in Georgia about various threats to marriage.He said that as a priest, bishop and even now pope, he had ministered to people with homosexual tendencies as well as some who were not able to remain chaste, as the Church asks them to be.""I accompanied them, I brought them closer to the Lord,"" he said. ""Some were not able (to obey Church teachings), but I accompanied them and I never abandoned one of them. That is a fact. People must be accompanied just like Jesus accompanies them.""During his trip to Georgia and Azerbaijan, he told priests and nuns that teaching gender theory in schools was part of a ""global war"" against marriage.Gender theory is broadly the concept that while people may be biologically male or female, they have the right to identify themselves as male, female, both or neither.""What I was talking about was the nastiness that is present today in indoctrinating people in gender theory,"" he said when asked to elaborate on his earlier comments in Georgia.""IDEOLOGICAL COLONIZATION""He said gender theory being taught in schools ""is against natural things.""""It is one thing for a person to have this tendency, this option, and even change sex,"" he said. ""But it is another thing to teach it, gender theory, in schools along these lines in order to change mentality. I call this ideological colonisation.""The pope has used the phrase ""ideological colonisation"" inthe past to denounce what he says are attempts by rich countries to link development aid to the acceptance of social policies such as allowing gay marriage and contraception.Francis told the story of a Spanish person he met who told him of how much he had suffered because he felt like a boy in a girl's body. The person later had a sex change operation and married a woman.The person told Francis in a letter how much the couple suffered when a local priest shouted to them: ""You will go to hell."" Francis invited them to the Vatican to talk, and the couple were pleased that they were treated with dignity.""Life is life, and things should be taken as they come,"" the pope said. ""Sin is sin, but tendencies or hormonal imbalances ... can cause many problems and we have to be careful.""But each case must be welcomed, accompanied, studied, discerned and integrated. This is what Jesus would do today.""He then joked: ""Please don't write that the pope will sanctify transsexuals. I can see the front pages of papers now. But no, it is a moral question. It is a human question, and it must be resolved as best as possible, always with the mercy of God, the truth ... always with an open heart."""

The family has new hope of a reprieve —  Supreme Court has said it will hear an appeal for Bibi later this month.Their fight has reached all the way to the Vatican, where Esham found herself face to face with Pope Francis in April last year as the head of Catholic church offered prayers for her mother.

1701,"Colombians narrowly rejected a peace deal with Marxist guerrillas in a referendum on Sunday, plunging the nation into uncertainty and dashing President Juan Manuel Santos' painstakingly negotiated plan to end the 52-year war.The surprise victory for the ""no"" camp poured cold water on international joy, from the White House to the Vatican, at what had seemed to be the end of the longest-running conflict in the Americas.The ""no"" camp won by 50.21 percent to 49.78 percent. Voter turnout was only 37 percent, perhaps partly owing to torrential rain through the country.Both sides in the war immediately sought to reassure the world they would try to revive their peace plan.Santos, 65, said a ceasefire already negotiated would remain in place, that he would sit down on Monday with the victorious ""no"" camp to discuss the way forward, and send his chief negotiator back to Cuba to meet with FARC rebel leaders.""I will not give up, I will keep seeking peace until the last day of my term because that is the way to leave a better nation for our children,"" said Santos, who cannot seek re-election when his second term ends in August 2018.The commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, known by his nom de guerre, Timochenko, gave a similar message from Havana, where peace negotiations have taken place over the last four years.""The FARC reiterates its disposition to use only words as a weapon to build toward the future,"" said Timochenko, whose real name is Rodrigo Londono. ""To the Colombian people who dream of peace, count on us, peace will triumph.""Santos recently said a ""no"" vote would mean a return to war, and opinion polls had predicted he would win comfortably.Traditionally conservative Colombian voters, in favor of peace in principle but unhappy at perceived soft treatment for the guerrillas, confounded those forecasts.Opponents of the pact believed it was too lenient on the FARC rebels by allowing them to re-enter society, form a political party and escape jail sentences.""I voted no. I don't want to teach my children that everything can be forgiven,"" said Bogota engineer Alejandro Jaramillo, 35.RENEGOTIATION POSSIBLE?Opponents want a renegotiation of the deal with rebel leaders serving jail time and receiving no free seats in Congress.""This is a clear message. .. I ask all citizens to trust we will know how to handle this situation without agitation. We'll work with the government to remake this accord,"" said former Vice President Francisco Santos, a prominent ""no"" supporter.""No"" voters appeared more highly motivated, and some Colombians may have felt pressured to tell pollsters they were voting for peace despite private doubts.Regions still riven by the conflict, including poor areas along the Pacific and Caribbean coasts, voted resoundingly in favor of the deal, but formerly violent interior regions pacified during the presidency of former leader Alvaro Uribe backed the ""no"" camp.Uribe, still an influential figure in Colombia with a large following, led the ""no"" camp and the result was a huge victory for him.The rebels, whose numbers were halved to about 7,000 in recent years because of a U.S.-backed military offensive, had agreed to turn in weapons and fight for power at the ballot box instead.Under the accord, the FARC, which began as a peasant revolt in 1964, would have been able to compete in the 2018 presidential and legislative elections and have 10 unelected congressional seats guaranteed through 2026.It would also have given up its role in the lucrative illegal drug trade and taken part in reforming rural Colombia.But controversially, many rebel leaders who ordered killings, bombings and displacements would have had to appear before a special tribunal that could sentence them to alternative punishments like clearing landmines.BLOODSHEDFor decades, the FARC bankrolled the longest-running conflict in the Americas through the illegal drug trade, kidnapping and extortion.Battles between the guerrillas, paramilitaries, drug gangs and the army raged in the countryside and there were atrocities committed on all sides.The conflict took more than 220,000 lives and displaced millions of people. At one stage, the FARC was positioned close to the capital and the state was on the verge of collapse.Supporters of the peace deal were stunned by the plebiscite result.""How sad. It seems Colombia has forgotten about the cruelty of war, our deaths, our injured, our mutilated, our victims and the suffering we've all lived through with this war,"" said Adriana Rivera, 43, a philosophy professor standing tearfully at the hotel of the ""yes"" campaign.The vote was a disaster for Santos, who had hoped to turn his focus quickly to other matters including possible talks with the smaller ELN rebel group, a much-needed tax reform and other economic measures to compensate for a drop in oil income.The government had hoped peace would lead to a boom in investment by commodities investors, in gold mines, oil and agriculture in Latin America's fourth-largest economy.After Sunday's vote, companies will be rethinking the situation.Although the ""no"" camp has broached the idea of fresh talks, the FARC has said no group sits at a negotiating table to agree to jail time.""Today will be remembered by history as the moment Colombia turned its back on what could have been the end of a war that for more than 50 years devastated millions of lives,"" said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director for rights group Amnesty International. ""Even though it was imperfect, the accord was a sure path to peace and justice."" "
1702,"WASHINGTON: A senior US Treasury official on Wednesday criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its views on the Trump administration’s tax proposals and said the institution should keep out of the US fiscal policy debate.The IMF has deleted its earlier forecasts of a growth boost from Trump’s tax cut and reform plans, which have been slow to materialize.Fund officials also have disputed the Trump administration’s views that these plans could boost growth consistently to the 3 percent or higher level that the administration has targeted and have said the plans should not increase US deficits.The Fund also released a report on Wednesday saying that progressive tax systems are better for fighting inequality and growth, with higher rates on wealthier individuals.“The IMF, I think, has other things to do in the world than interject itself into the US tax debate,” the Treasury official told reporters, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said that Trump’s tax program was a work in progress but would boost growth and median incomes, adding: “The IMF is not really the ones that ought to be rating the odds for this.”The United States is the IMF’s largest shareholder with a 16.5 percent share of the institution’s board votes, giving it an effective veto over decisions.The official also defended the Trump administration’s stance on globalization and international cooperation, saying it was not retreating from such engagement.The official said the administration is trying to get foreign governments ”to think about being modest in their view of their own role within the way the world economy works.“One of the things that we want to push against, we need to push against is the tendency of the governments to run the economies, run the people of the world, so that’s a priority.”"

1705,"ISLAMABAD: Senior Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) leader and Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday said that the resolution passed by the Senate today was a ‘person-specific’ move that was made at the behest of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Co-Chairman Asif Ali Zardari.The resolution states that a person who is not eligible to become a member of the Parliament or has been disqualified cannot lead any political party.Resolution questions the move by asking how a disqualified person can make policies for a political party“The Senate only approved this resolution on one person’s [Asif Zardari] behest,” the provincial law minister said.Sanaullah insisted that the reason that the resolution was passed was Zardari’s wish to refute the allegations of a backdoor deal with PML-N, adding that the resolution holds no more than ‘recommendatory value’.“The very same Senate accepted the Elections Bill 2017, and it can’t now pass a resolution that negates the Elections Act 2017,” Sanaullah said while speaking on Geo News’ programme Capital Talk.Responding to a question if both, the ruling party and opposition had turned democracy and Parliament into a joke, Sanaullah denied PML-N’s non-serious behaviour in this regard, insisting that the Elections Bill 2017 had stayed in the standing committee for weeks before it was moved to the National Assembly, from where it was forwarded to the Senate and eventually approved.He questioned the opposition’s sudden ‘alertness,’ insisting that he fails to understand how members of the opposition failed to notice the bill all the while it passed through its due course.Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) Senator Taj Haider, however, defended his party and allies’ decision to pass the resolution, stating that forward-thinking demands for the house to be set in order, and till the political setup isn’t brought on track, the country can’t be brought on track either because it’s the politicians who have to ‘straighten up the systems.’“It is the need of time that there should be no doubts about the political leadership that is now brought forward,” Haider said.In response to a question about the opposition’s motive to pass the resolution the President of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association Advocate Arif Chaudhry said that the ‘Senate washed its face and cleared a burden of off its shoulders today.’Chaudhry said that the PML-N manoeuvred and manipulated to get the Elections Bill 2017 approved, and added that courts don’t place a lot of weight on ‘person-specific’ legislations.“The Elections Bill 2017 and this resolution are both person-specific legislations,” he said. “Someone ask these parties how many people-specific legislations have been passed in the past four years.”Weighing in on the argument, Defence Analyst Amjad Shuaib said that logic fails to accept the Elections Act 2017 because a ‘person disqualified from holding public office can’t be allowed to positively become the unchallenged king who pulls all the string of the civil administration.’“The resolution passed today, by the opposition and its allies, is only a meek attempt at damage control,” Shuaib said, adding that it made no logical sense that a person who is disqualified by the court of law from holding public office can hold a designation in a political party.The Elections Bill 2017 was approved in the Senate on October 2, after it won by a 48 to 47 majority. Among other amendments, the bill (now Act) dictates that every citizen holds the right to be a part of a political party and form a party with the only exception of government employees. The Elections Act 2017 drew heavy criticism from the opposition, which termed the move as the ruling party's 'desperate' attempt to restore Nawaz Sharif as PML-N's president after he was legally barred from holding the position in the July 28 Panama Papers case verdict by the Supreme Court.  In sharp contrast from the October 2 decision, the resolution against a disqualified person holding a party office received 52 votes in its favour today. "

1707,"SANTA ROSA: The death toll from some of California's worst-ever wildfires rose to 17 as thousands of firefighters battled Wednesday to bring the infernos under control.The fires which have devastated California's wine country are already among the deadliest ever in the western US state and officials warned they expect the toll to go up.Sonoma County, where 11 deaths have been reported, has been among the hardest hit with entire neighbourhoods reduced to ashes in the city of Santa Rosa, the county seat of 175,000 people.Around 200 people have been reported missing in Sonoma County but the county sheriff's department said it expected that most of them would eventually be located.Thousands of people have been left homeless, according to the authorities, and 25,000 people have evacuated their homes in Sonoma County alone to escape the fast-moving fires.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said Wednesday that firefighters were battling 22 wildfires that have burned nearly 170,000 acres (68,800 hectares).""We are facing some pretty significant monsters,"" The Los Angeles Times quoted Bret Couvea, a Cal Fire incident commander, as saying at a strategy briefing at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds early Wednesday.More than 2,000 homes and businesses have been destroyed including several wineries in Sonoma and Napa counties, the heart of the wine region.Aside from the 11 deaths in Sonoma County, three fatalities have been reported in Mendocino County, two in Napa County and one in Yuba County.President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in California, freeing up federal funding and resources to help fight the fires, and Governor Jerry Brown declared a state of emergency in eight counties.Strong winds which fueled the fires on Sunday and Monday died down on Tuesday and officials said they hoped the winds would remain light for Wednesday.""Let's hope for no wind and progress,"" the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department tweeted.Firefighters at the Sonoma strategy briefing were told that winds were forecast to be around five miles per hour (eight kilometres per hour) during the daytime, the Los Angeles Times said.They were expected to pick up to 15 mph (24 kph) in the afternoon and be between 25-30 mph (40-48 kph) overnight.Much of the damage in Santa Rosa could be seen from US Route 101, the north-south highway which runs from California through Oregon to Washington state.""The homes are gone, they are like dust,"" said Jack Dixon, a personal trainer who has lived in Santa Rosa for two decades. ""It is just like we were nuked.""Dixon told AFP that his own neighbourhood was spared when the fire ""miraculously"" changed direction but many others were not so fortunate.""I am surrounded by devastation and feel lucky it didn't happen to me,"" Dixon said.The Sonoma County Hilton perched on a hill overlooking Route 101 was a smouldering ruin of charred wood and twisted metal, as was the nearby Fountaingrove Inn.An enormous K-Mart store was entirely destroyed with only a couple of blackened walls still standing.Among the wineries which reportedly suffered damage were William Hill Estate Winery in Napa, Signorello Vineyards, Stags' Leap and Chimney Rock.Forest fires are common in the western United States during dry, hot summer months but, with 17 deaths so far, this year's California fires are among the deadliest ever in the state.The Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles County in 1933 killed at least 29 people and 25 people died in the 1991 Oakland Hills fire."

1709,"PARIS: Move over Saturn! Scientists have found a ring around an unassuming mini-planet in our Solar System to debunk the theory that only giant planets can be so adorned.The planet, dubbed Haumea, orbits the Sun far beyond Neptune — the eighth and furthest recognised ""full"" planet in our star system since Pluto was downgraded to dwarf status in 2006.About eight billion kilometres (five billion miles) from the Sun, Haumea spins rapidly on its own axis, and has a flattened, cigar-like shape.It takes 285 years to circle the Sun.Named after the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth, it is among a handful of known dwarf planets beyond the orbit of Neptune, which with the other so-called giant planets — Saturn, Uranus and Jupiter — all have rings.""Our discovery proves that there is a lot more diversity and imagination in our solar system than we had thought,"" study co-author Bruno Sicardy of the Paris Observatory told AFP.The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.A ring system had previously been discovered around a centaur dubbed Chariklo. Centaurs, which have unstable orbits, are considered large comets, not planets, which means this is the first observation of a ring around a dwarf planet.The new discovery came when Sicardy and a team predicted that Haumea would cross in front of a specific star, from Earth´s perspective, on January 21 this year.They trained 12 telescopes at 10 different laboratories on the spot and were able to measure many of the physical characteristics of the little-known planet discovered in 2004.Scientists can infer much about a planet´s density and size by how much light it blocks out as it moves in front of a star.In Haumea´s case, they found it sported a dense, Saturn-like ring some 70 kilometres wide, made of frozen particles.The planet has two moons."
1710,"SAN JOSE: Facebook Inc plans to release a new virtual reality headset that does not require a separate computer to operate, allowing for more mobile uses than the company’s existing Oculus Rift product, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Wednesday.Zuckerberg, speaking at a conference for virtual reality developers, said the “Oculus Go” device would cost $199 and ship early next year.Facebook has invested heavily in virtual reality hardware, expecting that the technology could one day move from a niche interest to a widely used platform for gaming, communication and business applications.In 2014, Facebook paid $3 billion to acquire Oculus and retain its employees.The new standalone headset will be more accessible because it will not be tethered to a computer, Zuckerberg said, differentiating the product from the Oculus Rift system and the rival Vive system made by HTC Corp.It will also be different from the Google Daydream headset, made by Alphabet Inc, because it will not require a smartphone to operate.Facebook will permanently cut the price of the Oculus Rift system to $399 from $499, the company said."
1711,"COPENHAGEN: Air pollution causes more than 500,000 premature deaths across Europe each year despite ""slowly"" improving air quality on the continent, the EU´s environment authority said Wednesday.Although data from the Copenhagen-based European Environment Agency (EEA) reveals some encouraging signs, in large part the result of new technologies, air pollution remains the leading environmental cause of premature death in the region.In its latest report, the EAA said 520,400 premature deaths in 41 European countries were caused by air pollutants generated by the burning of fossil fuels in 2014, compared with 550,000 in 2013.Of these, four out of five deaths (428,000) were directly linked to fine particulate matter, which measure less than 2.5 microns and can enter a person´s lungs and even the bloodstream.Data collected at monitoring stations showed that 82 percent of the EU´s urban population was exposed to these microscopic particulates, known as PM2.5, in 2015, down from 85 percent in 2013.Other sources of air pollution linked to the premature deaths include nitrogen dioxide, emitted in the air, and ground-level ozone caused by motor vehicle emissions.Within the 28 European Union members, fine particulates were responsible for more than three out of four premature deaths (399,000 out of 487,600) in 2014.""The European Commission is committed to tackling this and help member states make sure that the quality of their citizens´ air is of the highest standard,"" said Karmenu Vella, the EU commissioner for the environment, maritime affairs and fisheries. "

1715,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump suggested challenging licenses for NBC and other broadcast news networks on Wednesday, a salvo that followed reports his own secretary of state had called him a “moron” after a discussion of the US nuclear arsenal.“With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks, at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!” Trump — a Republican — wrote in a post on Twitter.Trump and his supporters have repeatedly used the term “fake news” to cast doubt on critical media reports about his administration, often without providing any evidence to support their case that the reports were untrue.Trump kept up his criticism of the media in an appearance with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday, saying, “It is frankly disgusting the press is able to write whatever it wants to write.”Any move to challenge media companies’ licenses, however, would likely face significant hurdles.The Federal Communications Commission — an independent federal agency — does not license broadcast networks but issues them to individual broadcast stations that are renewed on a staggered basis for eight-year periods.Comcast Corp — which owns NBC Universal — also owns 11 broadcast stations, including outlets in New York, Washington, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boston, Dallas, and Chicago.A Comcast spokeswoman referred the questions to NBC, which did not respond immediately.ABC, owned by Walt Disney Co, declined to comment as well.Shares in media companies fell after Trump’s tweet, potentially reflecting concerns the war of words could escalate.Comcast, Disney, CBS Corp, and Twenty-First Century Fox dipped 0.8 percent, 1.4 percent, 1.2 percent, and 2.8 percent, respectively.Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner called the market response a “short-term irrational knee-jerk reaction” and said Trump faced essentially insurmountable hurdles to getting licenses pulled.A spokesman for FCC chairman Ajit Pai did not immediately comment.Gordon Smith — the chief executive of the National Association of Broadcasters — defended the media’s free speech rights.“It is contrary to this fundamental right for any government official to threaten the revocation of an FCC license simply because of a disagreement with the reporting of a journalist,” he said in a statement.Numerous Democrats criticized Trump and urged Pai to denounce Trump’s comments.Senator Ed Markey wrote Pai on Wednesday asking him to “withstand any urges from President Trump to harm the news media and infringe upon the First Amendment”, a reference to the US Constitution’s free speech and press freedom guarantee.Democratic US Representative Frank Pallone said Trump “seemed to threaten broadcasters’ licenses only because he disagreed with their reporting. This threat alone could intimidate the press and lead to skewed and unfair reporting”.FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel responded to Trump by tweeting a link to an FCC fact sheet. “Not how it works,” she said on Twitter.According to a fact sheet on the FCC website, when reviewing licenses the agency must determine if a renewal is in the public interest.The FCC said in the fact sheet it expects “station licensees to be aware of the important problems and issues facing their local communities and to foster public understanding by presenting programming that relates to those local issues”.The agency does not issue similar licenses for cable networks like CNN and MSNBC or regulate internet news or other websites.The FCC has said the First Amendment “expressly prohibits the commission from censoring broadcast matter” and that its role “in overseeing program content is very limited"".In the early 1970s, the then-President Richard Nixon and his top aides discussed using the FCC’s license renewal process as a way of punishing the Washington Post for its coverage of the Watergate burglary that ultimately brought down his presidency.NBC News has reported on tensions between Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and has said Trump sought a dramatic increase in the US nuclear arsenal during a meeting with national security advisers in July.NBC reported Tillerson made his “moron” comment after that meeting.Trump on Saturday also suggested he should get “equal time” because of what he described as late-night television hosts’ “anti-Trump” material.The FCC’s equal time rules apply in limited cases to airtime for political candidates and not to criticism of elected leaders.Trump may have been referring to the “Fairness Doctrine” that was designed to ensure broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on public issues.Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration eliminated it in 1987."
1716,"BRUSSELS: Asking a Muslim employee to remove her headscarf when dealing with clients amounts to unlawful direct discrimination, a legal adviser to the European Union’s top court said in a written opinion on Wednesday. The case arose when Asma Bougnaoui,  a female employee of a French IT consultancy was fired after refusing to remove her headscarf when meeting clients, BBC reported. She challenged this before a French court, which referred the case to the European Court of Justice.  ""There is nothing to suggest she was unable to perform her duties as a design engineer because she wore an Islamic headscarf,"" Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston wrote.  Opinions by the Court’s advocates general are advisory but it usually follows their advice in drawing up a final ruling. While a company could impose a neutral dress code if it pursued a legitimate aim, Sharpston said it was hard to see how such a measure could be seen as proportionate in the present case. Bourgnaoui was hired by the company in 2008 where she was told that she might not be able to wear a headscarf during work. She refused and she was dismissed in 2009. After losing her job she filed a case in the French court.France bars civil servants from wearing clothing indicating religious belief, such as a headscarf or a Jewish skullcap, but not employees in the private sector. Companies can set dress codes but their exact legal status is disputed."
1717,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Wednesday denied a report from NBC News that he told his national security advisers in July he wanted to increase the country’s nuclear arsenal by nearly tenfold, saying he argued for its modernization.NBC News said the president called for the increase after he was shown a chart indicating the stockpile of US nuclear weapons had slid from a high of 32,000 in the 1960s. Trump said he wanted to have that same number now, NBC reported.Speaking to reporters at the White House during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump said the report was not true.“I never discussed increasing it. I want it in perfect shape. That was just fake news by NBC,” he said. “We don’t need an increase. But I want modernization and I want total rehabilitation. It’s got to be in tip-top shape.”The president’s denial was buttressed by a statement from his defence chief.“Recent reports that the president called for an increase in the US nuclear arsenal are absolutely false. This kind of erroneous reporting is irresponsible,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said.Although US presidents have modernized weapon stockpiles over the years, any meaningful addition to the nuclear arsenal would violate treaty agreements.The Federation of American Scientists says the United States currently has about 4,000 nuclear warheads earmarked for use in its military stockpile.After the meeting in July, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson referred to Trump as a “moron,” according to NBC. US news reports have painted the relationship between Trump and Tillerson as tense.The NBC report comes during a time of high tension between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and missile programs, and just ahead of an expected announcement from Trump on whether to decertify the international deal on Iran’s nuclear program.Trump told Reuters in February that he wanted to ensure that the US nuclear arsenal was at the “top of the pack”.MSNBC reported in 2016 that as a candidate, Trump asked a foreign policy adviser three times in a one-hour meeting why the United States could not deploy its nuclear weapons."
1718,"The death toll from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has risen to 44 three weeks after the storm ripped through the island, Governor Ricardo Rossello said Wednesday.In a statement in which he also asked Congress for more financial assistance, Rossello updated the toll released on Tuesday after another person died due to a fractured skull.""There are also four deaths confirmed to be related to leptospirosis,"" he added, referring to a rare bacterial disease contracted through the urine of infected animals.With over 5,700 people living in shelters and most of the island still without electricity and running water, the risk posed by contagious diseases is amplified because the landscape and infrastructure remains severely damaged following the Category Four storm.As a result, Rossello added that he has asked President Trump for an additional $4.9 billion under the Community Disaster Loan program.""This program will allow the island the funds it needs to meet operational and payroll expenses,"" the governor wrote.Last Wednesday, Trump asked Congress to approve an emergency aid package of $29 billion for Puerto Rico.The latest request adds to ""billions we expect to receive for other aid we have requested,"" Rossello said.The governor's office did not respond to queries about the total amount of aid requested, which is now equivalent to around half of Puerto Rico's debt of some $73 billion.Maria devastated the island amid a severe financial crisis, with the government filing for bankruptcy in May.The crisis has caused 10 percent of the population to leave since 2006, with unemployment reaching 12 percent and poverty 46 percent.Figures of the latest exodus are unknown, but it is believed Maria's destruction has prompted thousands of Puerto Ricans to leave for the US mainland, with most heading for Florida."
1719,"ISLAMABAD: Leader of the opposition in the National Assembly Khursheed Shah presided a meeting on Wednesday to finalize names of four members for the Election Commission of Pakistan.Leaders from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement and Awami Muslim League among others participated in the meeting. However the names were not finalized.Under the Constitution, only the leaders of the House and opposition Nawaz Sharif and Khursheed Shah respectively have the exclusive role in the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and the ECP members.However, just to avoid needless tussle and confrontation, other political and parliamentary players are also taken into confidence so that all the top office holders of the electoral body enjoy universal consensus. This process also helps in selection of relatively non-controversial and non-partisan figures for the important positions.Speaking to the media after the meeting Pakistan People’s Party leader Khursheed Shah said that the ECP needs members who are not employees of any group.PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that the government had failed in dividing the opposition.The next meeting to select members of the ECP will be held on July 19.Meanwhile the Supreme Court expressed its displeasure over delay in selecting members of the ECP which has been lying dysfunctional and demanded a reply from the federal government. “The government is not doing its job. How will the country run like this?” the Chief Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali said.Conscious of the fast approaching deadline of July 25 to make these nominations, the two main constitutional consultees – Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and leader of opposition in the National Assembly Syed Khursheed Shah – are directly or indirectly taking the process forward.The real stage that may trigger a row will come when the two sides will insist on the acceptance of their recommended names as the ECP members. They will give their separate lists to each other.The government side has no problem in firming up its nominees because it doesn’t need to consult with anybody for the purpose. However, Khursheed Shah faces a different scenario. He has to take on board all the opposition parties, at least nine in the loose alliance that was formed to hold talks with the government on the Panama leaks in the ambit of a 12-member parliamentary committee, if he has to keep the prevailing bonhomie in the grouping intact. He will come out with his recommendations only after evolving a consensus in the coalition.Every party in this alliance will obviously aggressively try to push its favourite representatives to be inducted as the ECP members. "
1720,"LONDON: Having genes that give you red hair, pale skin and freckles increases your risk of developing skin cancer as much as an extra 21 years' exposure to the sun, researchers said on Tuesday.Their study found gene variants that produce red hair and freckly, fair skin were linked to a higher number of mutations that lead to skin cancers. The researchers said even people with one copy of the crucial MC1R gene - who may be fair-skinned but not have red hair - have a higher risk.""It has been known for a while that a person with red hair has an increased likelihood of developing skin cancer, but this is the first time that the gene has been proven to be associated with skin cancers with more mutations,"" said David Adams, who co-led the study at Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.""Unexpectedly, we also showed that people with only a single copy of the gene variant still have a much higher number of tumor mutations than the rest of the population.""Redheads make up between 1 and 2 percent of the world's population, but about 6 percent in Britain. They have two copies of a variant of the MC1R gene which affects the type of melanin pigment they produce, leading to red hair, freckles, pale skin and a strong tendency to burn in the sun. Exposure to ultraviolet light from either the sun or sunbeds causes damage to DNA and scientists think the type of skin pigment linked to redheads may allow more UV to reach the DNA. In this latest study, the researchers found that while this may be one factor in the damage, there are also others linked to the crucial MC1R gene.The team, whose work was published in the journal Nature Communications, analyzed data from of tumor DNA sequences collected from more than 400 people with cancer. They found an average of 42 percent more sun-associated mutations in tumors from people carrying the MC1R gene variant.The research showed the MC1R gene variation not only increased the number of spontaneous mutations caused by sunlight, but also raised the level of other mutations in the tumors.This suggests, the researchers said, that there are biological processes in the way cancer develops in people with MC1R variation that are not only related to ultraviolet light.""This ... explains why red-haired people have to be so careful about covering up in strong sun,"" said Julie Sharp of the charity Cancer Research UK, which co-funded the research.""It also underlines that it isn't just people with red hair who need to protect themselves from too much sun."""

1726,"LONDON: Theresa May will become Britain´s second ever female prime minister on Wednesday when David Cameron steps down after a seismic referendum to leave the European Union that sent shockwaves round the world and wrecked his career.Cameron is to hold his final weekly question-and-answer session in parliament before tendering his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.The monarch will then call on May, currently the interior minister, to form a government and the newly-anointed prime minister will make a statement outside her new Downing Street residence.European leaders have asked the government to move quickly to formalise its divorce from the EU but May has indicated she will not be rushed into triggering the formal procedure for Brexit.The 59-year-old vicar´s daughter, who will be Britain´s second female premier after the steely Margaret Thatcher with whom she is often compared, must also attempt to bridge Conservative Party divisions and deal with a potential economic downturn.Her other daunting challenges include keeping pro-EU Scotland from bidding for independence in order to stay in the 28-nation bloc, and weaving new global trade and diplomatic alliances to prepare for a post-Brexit future.For The Guardian daily, ""she comes to office at a time that would have challenged a Churchill.""Clouds lift May campaigned, albeit it quietly, with Cameron for Britain to stay in the EU and she will have to convince eurosceptics within her party and the country at large that she has no intention of ducking out of implementing the June 23 vote to quit the bloc.""Brexit means Brexit -- and we´re going to make a success of it,"" the politician, who is reputed for being a tough negotiator, has said.After six years in office, Cameron announced he would resign the day after the vote. He will chiefly be remembered for organising a referendum aimed at stopping his party ""banging on about Europe"" and then spectacularly failing to clinch it.He sought to deflect that criticism in an interview with the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday, saying: ""As I leave, I hope people will see a stronger country, a thriving economy and more chances to get on in life.""It has been a privilege to serve the country I love.""May´s bid for his job accelerated as key proponents of Britain´s EU withdrawal, including charismatic former mayor of London Boris Johnson, stepped back in a head-spinning round of political bloodletting.The vote exposed deep inequalities in British society, which May has promised to address, and upended the political scene, tipping her Conservatives and the main opposition Labour Party into turmoil.Labour´s embattled leader Jeremy Corbyn, who was accused of failing to persuade working-class voters to back EU membership, is now also embroiled in a bitter leadership contest of his own.On Wednesday, Owen Smith became the second candidate after fellow MP Angela Eagle to join the race to try unseat the veteran socialist.""I will stand in this election and I will do the decent thing and fight Jeremy Corbyn on the issues,"" Smith told the BBC.May, meanwhile, is expected to begin announcing her cabinet picks later Wednesday, including a Brexit minister in charge of leading negotiations with the EU.Women are expected to scoop several top jobs, media reports said Wednesday. Among those tipped for senior roles are current energy minister Amber Rudd, foreign minister Philip Hammond, Brexit campaigner Chris Grayling, who is the Conservatives´ House of Commons leader, and Justine Greening, international development secretary.Investors will be watching May´s first days in office closely but with greater optimism after the value of the pound, which fell by up to 15 percent against the dollar and the euro in the days of the Brexit vote, rebounded on news of her impending promotion.""Theresa May´s virtual ´coronation´ as prime minister has delivered a boost to the pound as the clouds of uncertainty following the Brexit vote start to disperse,"" said market analyst Neil Wilson at ETX Capital, a financial trading company in London.Leopard-skin heelsMay has been a tough-talking interior minister for the past six years and is something of an unknown quantity internationally, although she has received ringing endorsements from party colleagues and a normally sceptical British tabloid press.She is also liked in and around Maidenhead, the well-to-do commuter town west of London that she has represented in parliament since 1997.""She will get this country back on its feet,"" said 69-year-old Jim Charlesworth, a neighbour of May and her banker husband Philip.Martin Trepte, editor of the Maidenhead Advertiser, the local newspaper, said: ""She´s a mature, grown-up, no-nonsense politician. She knows her stuff.""The daughter of a Church of England pastor, May is a cricket fan with a sober, well-mannered demeanour who lists her hobbies as cooking and walking.She shows a flash of flamboyance with a colourful shoe collection -- particularly her leopard-skin heels -- which has become famous in the British press."

1732,"LONDON: Outgoing British Prime Minister David Cameron urged his successor Theresa May on Wednesday to maintain close ties with the EU even while negotiating to leave it, as he paid a fond farewell to MPs hours before leaving office.In his final question and answer session in the House of Commons, Cameron said he would ""miss the roar of the crowd and the barbs from the opposition"" that came with the job over the past six years.But, he pointed wistfully to the capricious winds of politics that had abruptly ended his career, saying: ""I was the future once.""The Conservative leader quit after Britain voted to leave the European Union against his wishes.But he had some final advice for May, his long-time interior minister who was sitting beside him.""My advice to my successor, who is a brilliant negotiator, is that we should try to be as close to the European Union as we can be, for the benefits of trade, of co-operation and of security,"" he said.Later Wednesday, Cameron will tender his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, after which the monarch will task May with forming a government.The 59-year-old will be the second woman to lead Britain, following in the footsteps of fellow Conservative, ""Iron Lady"" Margaret Thatcher.The steely vicar’s daughter faces a daunting challenge in trying to negotiate an amicable divorce from the EU following the shock vote for Brexit on June 23.EU leaders have said they expect May to move quickly, and French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Italy’s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced they will hold a summit in August on the vote.May has indicated however that she will not be rushed into triggering the formal procedure for Brexit.She is expected to begin announcing her cabinet choices before the day is out, including a Brexit minister in charge of securing a new trade and travel deal with the EU.  Johnson among cabinet hopefuls Finance minister George Osborne, who fought alongside Cameron to remain in the union, is expected to lose his job, with May sharply critical of his legacy.Women are expected to secure several top jobs, with current energy minister Amber Rudd and international development minister Justine Greening tipped for lead roles along with foreign minister Philip Hammond and Brexit campaigner Chris Grayling.Friends of former London mayor Boris Johnson told The Telegraph newspaper he also hoped to play a ""significant role"", two weeks after he dramatically withdrew from the race to succeed Cameron.Investors will be watching May’s first days in office closely but with greater optimism since the pound, which fell by up to 15 percent against the dollar in the days after the Brexit vote, rallied this week.May campaigned as a safe pair of hands who will help bridge Conservative Party divisions and restore investor confidence in the face of a potential economic downturn.Her other mammoth challenges include keeping pro-EU Scotland from bidding for independence in order to stay in the 28-nation bloc, and weaving new trade and diplomatic alliances beyond the EU.  ‘I was the future once’ In a good-natured session of parliament, Cameron took potshots at embattled Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who faces a bitter leadership battle of his own.On Wednesday, Owen Smith became the second Labour MP to announce a bid to try to oust Corbyn, who is resisting pressure to resign over his perceived lacklustre campaigning for Britain’s continued EU membership.""We got on with it, we’ve had resignation, nomination, competition and coronation -- they haven’t even decided what the rules are yet!""

Armed police patrolled outside.France’s consulate in Istanbul, its embassy in Ankara and its mission in the Aegean city of Izmir were all to have held celebrations marking the July 14 French national day.French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said he had personally taken the decision to cancel the receptions after receiving information about a ""real and concrete threat"".""The information which we received, and was confirmed by an exchange with the Turkish services, showed that there was a real and concrete threat,"" he told reporters in Paris, without giving any details.Earlier, the Istanbul consulate sent an email message to French citizens in Turkey saying there had been ""concurring information of a serious threat against the organisation of the July 14 celebrations in Turkey"".  ‘France target for Daesh’ Turkey’s Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus suggested, in an interview with the A Haber TV channel, the threat could be from IS as the militants have previously targeted France and could do so again,""It is known France is a target for Daesh. Across the world, there is a potential for attacks against French targets. I hope we do not face this in Turkey but all precautions are being taken,"" he said.However, he said he did not know what specific threat France was referring to. He vowed that Turkish authorities would always protect French officials in the country.The June 28 attack on Ataturk International Airport raised new alarm over the security of foreigners in Turkey after a spate of attacks this year blamed on militants and Kurdish militants.Thirty-seven suspects have been placed under arrest over suspicion of involvement in the attacks and belonging to Daesh (IS). Of these, 15 are Turks and 22 foreigners, according to official media.Authorities have said a number of citizens of ex-Soviet republics are among the suspects, raising concerns over the threat to Turkey from militancy in the Central Asia and the Northern Caucasus.But of seven suspects arrested earlier this week, three are Algerian, two Tunisian and two Egyptian, the state-run Anadolu Agency said.Several foreign missions in Turkey, including the embassies and consulates of Germany and the United States, have closed for short periods this year due to a security threat."
1734,"ISLAMABAD: Outraged by what it alleged defamatory media campaign against its Chairman Imran Khan, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Wednesday, in a (complaint) letter, urged the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to take action against the TV channels.In the letter addressed to Pemra Chairman Absar Alam, the PTI media cell called for action against the TV channels that had tried to show that Imran Khan had married for a third time. “A delegation of the PTI, headed by Iftikhar Durrani, met Pemra Chairman Absar Alam at Pemra Headquarters, Islamabad and handed over a formal complaint,” a Pemra statement said.“Unethical of media to spread false news of my marriage based upon absolute lies,” said the PTI chief in tweets. Imran Khan said the channels showed pictures of women whom he had never known or met. “Had that happened in the UK, heads would have rolled,” he remarked.The PTI chairman charged that such disinformation was irresponsible and showed a moral and ethical collapse. The PTI's media cell referred to the reporting as ‘contrary to the local traditions, general morality and journalistic ethics’.The letter noted that the campaign was well-thought-out “to smear chairman PTI at the time when he is in England to visit his sons”. The letter said that rebuttals on the matter had already been issued by PTI's central information secretary, which were ignored by the channels.It criticised Pemra for being a ‘silent spectator to the hostility’ carried out against Imran Khan. A day earlier, news channels, quoting unconfirmed reports, stated Imran married a woman, a few days ago in London. Some channels and media showed image of a female as well.Pemra has referred the PTI complaint to the Council of Complaints, which will take it up for deliberations on July 15. In recent months, the authority has moved quickly against complaints received by individuals, groups and media houses. It not only imposed fines but also slapped ban on some media content and shows as well.—Originally published in The News"
1735,"LONDON: Theresa May became Britain's prime minister on Wednesday with the task of leading it out of the European Union, and quickly named leading 'Brexit' supporters including former London mayor Boris Johnson to key positions in her new government.The former Conservative interior minister, 59, said after being appointed by Queen Elizabeth that she would champion social justice and carve out a bright new future for Britain after last month's shock referendum vote to quit the EU.""We will rise to the challenge. As we leave the European Union we will forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world, and we will make Britain a country that works not for a privileged few, but for every one of us,"" she said outside 10 Downing Street, vacated hours earlier by David Cameron.Cameron stepped down after Britons rejected his entreaties to stay in the EU, a decision that has set back European efforts to forge greater unity and created huge uncertainty in Britain and across the 28-nation bloc.May faced immediate pressure from EU leaders to serve formal notice of Britain's withdrawal and set the clock ticking on a two-year countdown to its final departure.In phone calls with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande, May said she needed time.""On all the phone calls, the prime minister emphasized her commitment to delivering the will of the British people to leave the European Union,"" a spokeswoman for May said.""The prime minister explained that we would need some time to prepare for these negotiations and spoke of her hope that these could be conducted in a constructive and positive spirit.""Just over an hour after entering her new office, she started naming ministers, appointing the steady and experienced foreign minister Philip Hammond to take charge of the finance ministry. He replaces George Osborne, whose determination to balance Britain's books made him synonymous with austerity.In a major surprise, May named Johnson, a leading eurosceptic who had until recently been seen as her main rival for the prime minister's job, to take over as foreign secretary.Other prominent 'Leave' campaigners were also rewarded. One, David Davis, took the key role of Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union. Another, Liam Fox, was named to head a new international trade department.May herself had sided with Cameron in trying to keep Britain inside the EU, so needed to reach out to the winning Leave side in order to heal divisions in the ruling party and show her commitment to respecting the popular vote. ""Brexit means Brexit"" has quickly become her new mantra.By awarding such a senior job to Johnson, she also showed a conciliatory side. The two had clashed over policing in London while Johnson was serving as mayor. And since last month's vote, for which he campaigned vigorously, Johnson had suffered widespread criticism and ridicule for failing to present a clear Brexit plan and swiftly dropping out of the leadership race.With his unkempt blonde hair, bumbling humor and penchant for Latin quotations, the man known to Britons simply as 'Boris' will be the government's most colorful figure, but a controversial choice for conducting sensitive diplomacy with world leaders.Asked by a reporter whether he would apologize to U.S. President Barack Obama for controversially saying the ""part-Kenyan"" president was biased against Britain because of ""an ancestral dislike of the British empire"", Johnson said: ""The United States of America will be in the front of the queue.""The quip was a reference to a comment by Obama during Britain's EU referendum campaign that the country would be at the back of the queue for trade deals if it voted to leave the bloc.Among other appointments, rising star Amber Rudd switched from the energy ministry to take May's old job as Home Secretary.'Burning injustice'May is Queen Elizabeth's 13th prime minister in a line that started with Winston Churchill. An official photograph showed her curtseying to the smiling monarch.She is also Britain's second female head of government after Margaret Thatcher.Seen as a tough, competent and intensely private person, already being compared to Germany's Angela Merkel, she must now try to limit the damage to British trade and investment as she renegotiates the country's ties with its 27 EU partners. She will also attempt to unite a fractured nation in which many, on the evidence of the referendum, feel angry with the political elite and left behind by the forces of globalization.In comments addressed to ordinary Britons, she spoke of the 'burning injustice' suffered by large sections of society: poor people facing shorter life expectancy; blacks treated more harshly by the criminal justice system; women earning less than men; the mentally ill; and young people struggling to buy homes.Acknowledging the struggles faced by many, May declared: ""The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours. We will do everything we can to give you more control over your lives.""She spoke of the ""precious bond"" between the nations of the United Kingdom, implicit recognition of the tensions generated by the referendum in which England and Wales chose to quit the EU, but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay, raising the possibility of a new Scottish vote on independence.Outside Downing Street, a group of demonstrators chanted: 'What do we want? Brexit! When do we want it? Now!'The United States congratulated May and said it was confident in her ability to steer Britain through the Brexit negotiations.""Based on the public comments we've seen from the incoming prime minister, she intends to pursue a course that's consistent with the prescription that President Obama has offered,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.May's predecessor Cameron, appearing earlier in Downing Street with his wife Samantha and their three children, delivered his parting remarks to the nation after six years dominated by the Europe question and the aftermath of the global financial crisis.""It's not been an easy journey and of course we've not got every decision right,"" he said, ""but I do believe that today our country is much stronger.""In his last parliamentary session as leader, Cameron took the opportunity to trumpet his government's achievements in generating one of the fastest growth rates among western economies, chopping the budget deficit, creating 2.5 million jobs and legalizing gay marriage.Yet his legacy will be overshadowed by his failed referendum gamble, which he had hoped would keep Britain at the heart of a reformed EU."
1736,"MADRID: Spain on Friday issued an arrest warrant on sedition and other charges against Carles Puigdemont, tightening the judicial net around the former Catalan leader who went Brussels after his government was sacked over a declaration of independence.A Madrid High Court judge asked Belgium to arrest Puigdemont and four associates after they ignored a court order to return to Spain on Thursday to answer charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust relating to their secessionist campaign.The judge rejected a request from Puigdemont to testify via video conference from Belgium.In Brussels, a federal prosecutor said Belgian authorities would study the warrant before handing it to a judge. ""We will give it to an investigative judge maybe tomorrow or the day after,"" Eric Van der Sypt told Reuters.Puigdemont, who is considering standing in a snap election in the region on Dec. 21, has said he did not trust Spanish justice but would cooperate with the Belgian courts.Embroiled in Spain's gravest political crisis since the return of democracy in the late 1970s, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy called the election when he took control of Catalonia in response to last week's declaration of independence by its parliament.Belgium, where a European arrest warrant can be blocked for several mainly procedural reasons, will have a maximum of three months to decide whether to send Puigdemont back to Spain.On Thursday, nine members of his sacked cabinet were ordered by the High Court to be held in custody pending an investigation and potential trial.""We consider ourselves a legitimate government,"" Puigdemont told Belgian state television RTBF on Friday. ""There must be a continuity to tell the world what's going on in Spain ... It's not with a government in jail that the elections will be neutral, independent, normal.""""... I am ready to be a candidate ... it's possible to run a campaign from anywhere.""The detention of the secessionist leaders and Puigdemont's journey to Belgium have given a new boost to the secessionist camp after cracks had appeared in its ranks.In protest at the jailings, Catalan civic groups Asamblea Nacional Catalana and Omnium Cultural -- whose leaders were imprisoned last month on sedition charges -- called for a general strike on Nov. 8 and a mass demonstration on Nov. 11.Another six Catalan leaders are due to testify on Nov. 9 on the same charges.One member of the dismissed cabinet, Santi Vila, was released after paying bail of 50,000 euros ($58,300) on Friday. The other eight could remain in custody for up to four years.Vila stepped down from the Catalan cabinet before the independence declaration. While he remains a supporter of an secession he has advocated a negotiated solution with the central government.He has said he wanted to stand as the leading candidate for Puigdemont's PdeCat (Catalan Democratic party) in the regional election.Thousands of people staged pro-independence protests on Thursday night in several Catalan towns, and parties forming the current coalition Junts Pel Si (Together For Yes) are pushing to run again on a joint ticket at the election.An opinion poll published on Tuesday showed Junts Pel Si would win in December with 35.2 percent if the vote was held immediately and would likely reach a parliamentary majority if it stuck with its current pact with far-left party CUP.The Spanish government said on Friday it would have no option but to open talks within the law with those who held a majority.""We could offer a new dialogue so that we can fulfil Catalans' aspirations for more autonomy and look into reforming the constitution,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Alfonso Dastis told French newspaper Le Figaro in an interview.""Some even mention the idea of a federal model so that regions can have more autonomy, including financially."""
1737,"BEIJING: US President Donald Trump has tweeted energetically throughout his Asian tour so far, but in China he will likely be one of a select few to skirt the country's ban on his cherished website.The Twitter-happy president has fired off a slew of posts -- on both domestic and international issues -- since he started his trip in Japan and moved on to South Korea on Tuesday.But when he lands in China on Wednesday, Trump will enter the so-called ""Great Firewall"" of online censorship that monitors people's internet habits and blocks websites such as Twitter, Facebook and Google.Chinese can face fines or even jail time for unfavourable social media posts. Authorities have further tightened internet controls in recent months, shutting down celebrity gossip blogs and probing platforms for ""obscenity"".Asked whether Trump -- who will get red-carpet treatment during his state visit -- would be able to tweet, Chinese vice foreign minister Zheng Zeguang told reporters: ""How President Trump communicates with the outside is not something you need to worry about.""Trump, who has used an iPhone for Twitter posts, could use some options available to people in China to evade the Great Firewall -- though US presidents in any case travel with their own sophisticated communications systems.Web users can circumvent the firewall if they download a virtual private network (VPN) -- software that allows people to surf the internet as if they were using a server in another country.But Beijing mandated in January that all developers must obtain government licences to offer VPN software, raising concern it might ban them outright.Foreign visitors can also access banned websites with their phones if they are in roaming mode -- but only because the authorities currently allow it, according to experts.Trump should be able to use roaming ""but it depends on the policy of the (Chinese) government. If they chose not to allow you to (use roaming) then they can do it,"" James Gong, a Chinese cyber law expert at Herbert Smith Freehills law firm, told AFP.""But if you're the president you should be able to do it. Donald Trump cannot live without Twitter,"" Gong said.Mobile devices on roaming in China still use the local telecom service infrastructure, which raises privacy and security questions.Charlie Smith, co-founder of the anti-censorship group Greatfire.org, said phones using data or virtual private networks (VPNs) are ""generally"" safe from hacking but it depends on the phone, user settings and other factors.""As you know, every day in China, almost all mobile phone use is monitored and tens of thousands of people are under close watch,"" he told AFP.""US officials should be well trained and prepared for travelling overseas and for maintaining secure communications, as the Chinese leadership are when they travel overseas.""Trump could also use an alternative temporary phone as another way to avoid the risk of compromising his smartphone in a country which is often accused of hacking."
1738,"TOKYO: A one-time millionairess dubbed the ""Black Widow"", who tricked elderly lovers into drinking cyanide and then pocketed millions in insurance payouts and inheritance, was sentenced to death in Japan on Tuesday.Kyoto District Court condemned Chisako Kakehi, 70, to the gallows for the murder of three men -- including a husband -- and for the attempted murder of another, ending a high-profile case that has gripped the country.Kakehi became notorious after using poison to dispatch a number of elderly men she was involved with, drawing comparisons with the spider that kills its mate after copulation.""The accused made the victims drink a cyanide compound with a murderous intention in all four cases,"" Judge Ayako Nakagawa told the court, according to public broadcaster NHK.""The cases were well prepared in advance. They were cunning and malicious. I have no choice but to impose the ultimate penalty.""Nakagawa rejected defence lawyers´ arguments that Kakehi was not criminally liable because she was suffering from dementia.More than 560 people queued for 51 seats in the courtroom to witness the outcome of the marathon trial, which lasted 135 days.It was the second-longest court case involving a jury since Japan introduced a joint judge-jury system in 2009.Gray-haired Kakehi, wearing a hearing aid headphone, asked the judge to speak loudly. She showed no emotion when the judge handed down the sentence.The court said she killed the men after they made her the beneficiary of life assurance policies that reportedly ran into millions of dollars.""For the love of money,"" the accused poisoned the victims who fully trusted her, the judge said.Kakehi reportedly amassed one billion yen ($8.8 million) in payouts over 10 years but subsequently lost most of the fortune through unsuccessful financial trading.She had relationships with many men, mostly elderly or ill, meeting some through dating agencies, where she reportedly stipulated that prospective partners should be wealthy and childless.Kakehi, also known as ""The Poison Lady"", is said to have stashed some of her cyanide in a plant pot she later threw out.The poison was found in the body of at least two of the men she was involved with and police reportedly found traces of cyanide in the rubbish at her Kyoto home. They also found paraphernalia for administering drugs and medical books at an apartment she kept south of Kyoto.Kakehi initially refused to speak when her trial began in June but later stunned the court by admitting killing her fourth husband in 2013.""I killed him... because he gave other women tens of millions of yen but did not give me even a penny,"" she told the court, according to Jiji Press.She had earlier told judges she was ready to hang.""Even if I were executed tomorrow, I would die smiling,"" Kakehi told judges.After Tuesday´s ruling, her lawyers immediately appealed to a higher court, suggesting the high-profile trial could yet drag on."
1739,"KABUL: At least two people were killed and 20 injured when gunmen stormed a Kabul television station on Tuesday, reported TOLO News. The station was back on the air after Afghan security forces brought the deadly assault to an end.""The attack has ended. According to the commander of the special forces all the staff who were inside the building have been rescued,"" Shamshad TV announced shortly after the attack ended.A tweet from the station’s Twitter account said staffers reported several casualties inside the building and staff members reached by telephone said between two and five people appeared to have been killed.Kabul police spokesman Basir Mujahid said casualties were feared but he said the number was still unclear.The militants were firing rocket propelled grenades at heavily armed security forces surrounding Shamshad TV, an AFP photographer said, as some staff remained trapped inside the building.Security forces were trying to blast their way through a wall of the compound in order to enter the Pashto-language broadcaster, which had gone off the air and was transmitting only a holding image.""I saw three attackers on security cameras entering the TV station building. They first shot the guard and then entered the building. They started throwing grenades and firing,"" Shamshad TV reporter Faisal Zaland, who escaped through a back door, told AFP.An AFP photographer saw security forces helping two employees escape the compound.Gunshots were heard inside the building every few minutes as more and more security forces swarmed the area.Interior ministry spokesman Najib Danish had said as many as three attackers were involved in the assault.""The security forces have been able to bring one down and the operation is ongoing,"" Danish told AFP, adding that ""most"" staff have been rescued.There was no immediate claim of responsibility in the attack, but in a Twitter statement the Taliban swiftly denied it was involved.Kabul has been rocked by a series of deadly attacks in recent weeks as the Taliban and Daesh insurgents step up offensives against security installations and mosques.Violence against Afghan journalists surged in the first half of 2017, a media watchdog said in July.Last year the country suffered its deadliest year on record for journalists, according to AJSC, with at least 13 media workers killed -- 10 by the Taliban. That made it the second most dangerous place for reporters in the world after Syria.In January last year, seven employees of popular TV channel Tolo, which is often critical of the insurgents, were killed in a Taliban suicide bombing in Kabul in what the militant group said was revenge for ""spreading propaganda"" against them.It was the first major attack on an Afghan media organisation since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, and spotlighted the dangers faced by media workers in Afghanistan as the security situation worsens.Security in Kabul has been ramped up since a May 31 truck bomb exploded on the edge of the so-called ""Green Zone"", killing around 150 people and wounding 400 others.That attack also caused extensive damage to 1TV, a private news channel located close to the bombing site. In an act of defiance, the news channel managed to resume operations within a few hours.Special truck scanners, barriers and permanent and mobile checkpoints have been rolled out across the city since the May bombing.But a suicide bomber struck again in Kabul´s heavily fortified diplomatic quarter last week, killing at least five people, showing that militants can still hit the heart of the city despite tighter security. "
1740,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Punjab Shehbaz Sharif remarked on Tuesday that the demand for a snap election is unreasonable.While speaking to media in Lahore, he said that the demand for snap elections is coming from people who have ruined Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “There are so many dengue cases being reported in KP but its officials have gone into hiding in mountains.”“These people [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz rivals] are against the construction of the Metro train project. They don’t want the project to be completed on time,” he claimed.Taking a dig at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairperson Imran Khan, Shehbaz said that Imran is himself absconding from the courts and then levelling allegations against others.Shehbaz then moved onto political rival, Asif Ali Zardari and claimed that it is ironic that Zardari is speaking about corruption. “Zardari has looted $60 million from the people of Pakistan.”Speaking about PML-N president, Shehbaz remarked that Nawaz Sharif is the leader of the party and his decision will be accepted by the others.Earlier in the day, Shehbaz had visited Pakistan Kidney and Liver Transplant Institute, which is currently under construction. He shared that the first phase of the hospital will be completed by December 25, adding that the 360-bedded hospital will be constructed by next year.“It is a project of which is being funded through public-private partnership,” he remarked, adding that the patients at the hospital will be treated free of cost. Currently, the government is searching for qualified doctors from across the globe for the hospital, he added.On smog in Lahore, Shehbaz remarked that there are different reasons for it. “We will overcome this challenge soon.”On Monday, Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal rejected calls for early elections and said the assemblies will be dissolved on June 5, 2018, after completing their constitutional tenure.Iqbal, in the company of the PML-N leaders, said Pakistan is a democracy and the only NRO in the existing in the country is the one in the hands of the people.Would be unfair to the smaller provinces if the elections are held on the results of the '98 census, says interior ministerThe interior minister further said all political parties of the country had agreed that the provisional results of the census would be used to hold the next general elections and it is not possible to conduct next year's elections on the results of the 1998 census.He said it would be unfair to the smaller provinces if the elections are held on the results of the '98 census.Iqbal added that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will start preparing for the general elections after the passing of a Constitutional amendment on November 10.Again rubbishing the talk of early elections, the interior minister reiterated that political parties of the country need to accept the provisional results and move forward as there is no chance of early elections."
1741,"Romelu Lukaku's signing from Everton continues to pay off as he scored and created a goal in Manchester United's 4-0 drubbing of his former club on Sunday with United joining Manchester City on top of the league.United -- whose record goalscorer Wayne Rooney endured a miserable return with his Everton team-mates -- are only second in the table by virtue of C coming before U as both the Manchester clubs share exactly the same statistics after five matches.Champions Chelsea are on 10 points, three adrift of the leading duo, after being held 0-0 at home to Arsenal -- the first scoreless draw at Stamford Bridge under Antonio Conte's tenure.United were slightly flattered by the final scoreline -- three goals coming in the final 10 minutes after Everton had largely dominated the second-half -- but manager Jose Mourinho was more than satisfied.""I think the performance was very good, especially in the first 30-35 minute, it was probably our best performance of the season,"" Mourinho told Sky Sports.""We pressed them and they did not have a chance to get out, they did not have a shot, it was very impressive.""For Everton and manager Ronald Koeman -- who spent £152million ($207million, 173million euros) in the close season -- it is fast becoming a crisis as this was their fourth successive defeat and in which they have failed to score to boot.The Dutchman grasped at whatever straw he could to see a positive side.""From what I saw today from the team it made me happy,"" he told Sky Sports.""More happy than Thursday (they lost to modest Serie A side Atalanta in the Europa League).""We grew in the game and in confidence and not many teams will get two big chances like we got today. We didn't score the goal and after a personal mistake (Everton central defender Ashley Williams) it was 2-0.""There was little cheer for Chelsea's Italian manager Antonio Conte -- or indeed for watching Hollywood star Channing Tatum and former Chelsea skipper John Terry -- where Arsenal ran the match for large portions of it.The hosts also ended the encounter like the previous two against the Gunners without a full complement of players as David Luiz was red carded three minutes from the end.Conte, though, felt that the referee Mike Dean should have blown for a foul just before Luiz clattered Sead Kolasinac.""It's very important to see what happened before the David Luiz tackle. For sure there was a foul,"" said Conte.""The referee has to use the whistle. If he stops the play before I think it (wouldn't) happen.""For Arsene Wenger and Arsenal there was something rare as it was the first time they have left Chelsea with even a point in their last six visits. Indeed Arsenal should have won it but their record signing Alexandre Lacazette missed an open goal after man of the match Aaron Ramsey's shot had come back off the post to him.Wenger, though, took pleasure out of the character his players had shown following their last away day when they were whipped 4-0 by Liverpool.""It was about mentality and a response from our last away game,"" said Wenger, whose side are six points adrift of the top two.""We could have won it. It was an intense game.""The battle was total. We are not in a transfer period and on the day we played Liverpool that affected us. We are all human beings.""We were focused and determined."""
1742,"Gareth Bale responded in style to his critics with a fine finish as Real Madrid got back to winning ways with a 3-1 win at Real Sociedad on Sunday.Borja Mayoral rewarded a bright start by Real with his first Madrid goal before Sociedad's Kevin Rodrigues scored at both ends to give the visitors a 2-1 half-time lead.And Bale secured the three points as he sped past Rodrigues and dinked the ball over Geronimo Rulli for just his second goal of the season on the hour mark.Victory moves the European champions up to fourth and within four points of leaders Barcelona.Bale had received stinging criticism from the Spanish press and Madrid fans for his underwhelming displays in Ronaldo's absence in recent weeks as Real dropped points at home to Valencia and Levante.""It's great to always score, but the most important thing was to get the three points for the team, get back on track and get back to winning ways,"" Bale told Spanish TV station Movistar.""I just have to try to keep my head down and keep working hard and that's all I can do.""I can't control what goes on, I can only control how hard I work on the pitch.""You go through ups and downs in your career -- it is how you bounce back.""Without the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo, as he completed a five-game ban, and injured Karim Benzema, Zinedine Zidane handed 20-year-old Mayoral a shock start up front.And the Frenchman's faith was rewarded inside 20 minutes when Mayoral swept home a loose ball with a classy finish from close range.Mayoral's strike meant Madrid have now matched a world record of scoring in 73 consecutive games set by Pele's Santos in the 1960s.However, the visitors' joy lasted just nine minutes as Rodrigues levelled thanks to a blunder from Keylor Navas.Rodrigues fired Alvaro Odriozola's cross towards goal on the volley, but the Real 'keeper should have made a comfortable stop rather than letting the ball slip under his grasp.The match was then held up as a cameraman had to be stretchered off with his leg heavily strapped as he was injured from fans surging forward from a temporary stand behind the goal Sociedad were defending.Once the game got back underway, a crazy 60 seconds for Rodrigues swung the match back in Madrid's favour.The left-back was inches away from bagging a second when his looping effort came back off the bar.However, Real broke straight up the other end and the unfortunate Rodrigues turned Mayoral's cross into his own net.Bale sealed the points after the break by scoring for the fifth straight match at Anoeta as his pace took him beyond the Sociedad defence before coolly chipping over the advancing Rulli.Earlier, Alaves sacked Argentine coach Luis Zubeldia after just four games in charge as they slipped to the bottom of La Liga with a 3-0 defeat at home to Villarreal.Zubeldia failed to muster a point or even a solitary goal in his brief stint in charge with defeats to Leganes, Barcelona and Celta Vigo also sealing his fate.By contrast, Sevilla's impressive start to the season continued with victory on the road at Girona to move up to second.Luis Muriel's first goal for the club since completing a 20 million euro ($24 million) move from Sampdoria was enough for a 1-0 win.And former Chelsea striker Loic Remy also bagged his first goal for Las Palmas to secure a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao."
1743,"DUBAI: Iran will not be bullied by the United States and will react strongly to any “wrong move” by Washington on Tehran’s nuclear deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday.US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Iran was violating “the spirit” of the 2015 deal, under which it got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program.State television quoted Khamenei as saying Iran was standing firm “and any wrong move by the domineering regime regarding the (nuclear accord) will face the reaction of the Islamic Republic”.Washington extended some sanctions relief for Iran on Thursday under the nuclear deal with world powers but said it had yet to decide whether to maintain the agreement.Trump must make a decision by mid-October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the deal — known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.“Today, despite all the commitments and discussions in the negotiations, America’s attitude toward these negotiations and their outcome is completely unjust and amounts to bullying,” Khamenei said in a speech to Iranian police academy graduates.“The Americans should know… there will be no retreat by the Islamic Republic.”The Foreign Ministry in Tehran condemned as “continued Iranophobia” Washington’s move on Thursday to impose sanctions on 11 individuals and firms, including two based in Ukraine, state news agency IRNA reported.The US Treasury accused the 11 of supporting Iran’s ballistic missile program or its Revolutionary Guards or engaging in cyber attacks against the US financial system.US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday he believed Iran was in technical compliance with the nuclear deal but had stepped up destabilizing activities in Yemen and Syria and continued to have an active ballistic missile program.“None of that, I believe, is consistent with that preamble commitment that was made by everyone” on the nuclear deal, he told CBS’ Face the Nation.Iran said last month it could abandon the nuclear agreement “within hours” if the United States imposed any new penalties after Washington ordered unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s ballistic missile tests.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani — speaking on Sunday before leaving to attend a UN General Assembly meeting in New York — said Washington should join the countries that continued to support the nuclear deal, which he compared to a dinner party.“They can choose the right path and also enter the room where the food is served. We would not have a problem with that,” IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying.The United States imposed unilateral sanctions, saying Tehran’s ballistic missile tests violated a UN resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal and called on Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying the missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons."
1744,"NEW YORK: US President Donald Trump is set to make his maiden address to the United Nations (UN) on Tuesday, a spectacle closely watched at home and around the world, with the potential to move armies, markets, and polls.Trump's appearance — which aides say will last around a half-hour — is the centrepiece of a week-long marathon of remarks by world leaders, each vying to make their mark on the global stage.But the US president will need no Nikita Khrushchev shoe-banging on the table, nor the guns and olive branches of Yasser Arafat to stand out.""We always had the sense that it was an incredibly closely watched speech,"" said top Barack Obama advisor Ben Rhodes — who helped draft eight presidential addresses to the UN.""A single line in an UNGA address could signal a new prioritization of a particular issue, a new policy direction and could send ripples out into the diplomatic community that lasted for many months to come.""Trump's speech to the General Assembly may be even more closely watched than those of his predecessors.During eight months in office, Trump has brusquely questioned decades-old alliances and ratcheted up the heat on simmering disputes with foes in North Korea and Iran.Allies and foes alike will rummage through his words for a better idea of how this lurching superpower foresees its future place in the world.""They are all very anxious to hear what he has to say. And I think that he will make quite an impact,"" said Nikki Haley — America's ambassador to the UN.That Haley has already read a draft of the speech suggests Trump may be more scripted than usual. But that does not mean the bombastic president will embrace the UN's typical diplomatic platitudes and studied ambiguity.""He slaps the right people, he hugs the right people,"" Haley said of the remarks.Trump is certain to take aim at North Korea, which has embarked on a headlong rush to marry the sinister power of nuclear and ballistic weapons.The White House has made plain its impatience with Pyongyang's behaviour, but on this, as other issues — from the Paris climate deal to trade to the Iran nuclear deal — Trump has struggled to calibrate his message for both domestic and foreign audiences.His approval ratings at home are already historically low and supporters are quick to cry betrayal at any perceived deviation from his hardline ""America First"" rhetoric.More tub-thumping at the UN would thrill his diehard fans, but bellicose warnings of impending ""fire and fury"" would undoubtedly make Tokyo and Seoul — both well within the range of North Korean artillery or ballistic missiles — uneasy.Shredding the ""bad deal"" that curbs Iran's nuclear program could burnish Trump's hard-charging businessman brand but would infuriate European allies and risks setting loose the dogs of war across the Middle East.Trashing the United Nations as ""just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time"" — that Trump did as a presidential candidate — is unlikely to win over friends among the delegates who vote on US proposals at the UN Security Council.In New York, Trump's audience will be as much Iran's Ali Khamenei and China's Xi Jinping as red-cap wearing supporters in Cincinnati or Jacksonville.But if Trump were restrained and measured, would it be believable?""One of the challenges for president Trump is that, because of Twitter, the entire world has seen him unfiltered so many times,"" said Vinca LaFleur — a foreign policy speechwriter for the then-president Bill Clinton.""We know what his authentic voice sounds like and it is very different from what is scripted for him.""""Because his scripted voice is so different from his unfiltered voice, I think that a speech that sounds too polished would be picked apart as: is that actually what the president really thinks?""The United Nations is just a 20-minute stroll away from Trump Tower, but it is an unfamiliar world for this tough-talking president."
1745,"WASHINGTON: After a succession of mixed messages on the US stance on climate change, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday that the Trump administration was seeking ""ways in which we can work with partners in the Paris climate accord"".""We want to be productive, we want to be helpful,"" Tillerson said on the CBS program Face the Nation.His comments did not amount to a reversal from US President Donald Trump's widely-criticized decision in June to withdraw from the landmark pact, signed by nearly 200 countries.But Tillerson did appear to signal a softening from Trump's earlier characterization of the deal as a ""draconian"" pact that impinged on American sovereignty and unfairly favoured countries like China and India over the US.When European environment officials suggested over the weekend that the United States might be ready to re-engage with the pact, the White House said that its position was unchanged and that it could stay only if more ""favourable"" terms were achieved.But Tillerson said Gary Cohn — Trump's chief economics adviser — was studying ways the US could cooperate with other countries on what he said, ""is still a challenging issue"".The remarks came days before Trump is to speak before world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York, where climate change seems sure to be a major topic.They also came after two devastating hurricanes struck the US mainland in recent weeks — made more intense, some scientists said, by waters warmed by climate change.Neither Tillerson nor Trump's national security adviser H.R. McMaster spoke of reopening negotiations over the Paris accord, an idea sharply rejected by other signatories. But the accord is voluntary, and it appeared the US might be able to find a way, within the pact, to recast its position.McMaster noted on ABC's This Week that Trump had ""left the door open to reentering (the pact) at some later time if there can be a better deal for the United States"", adding, ""Of course, he's open to any discussions that will help us improve the environment.""The process to withdraw from the Paris pact is lengthy. If Trump sticks to his plan, the United States would not formally pull out until November 4, 2020 — a day after the next US presidential election."
1746,"PARIS: Half a century after the United States plunged into war in Vietnam, scars remain unhealed. With a 10-part television epic, Ken Burns is hoping for a fuller understanding.The celebrated documentary filmmaker has invested 10 years into making The Vietnam War, which aims to offer a more balanced view on the still divisive conflict by bringing in a wide range of American and Vietnamese voices.""In many ways, the Vietnam War was our second civil war,"" said Burns, who won awards for his 1990 documentary on the 1861-65 US Civil War.""I think that in the US, Vietnam is still very unsettled, and a source of a great deal of division. And I think so too in Vietnam,"" he told AFP.The series — set to a hypnotic score by members of industrial rockers Nine Inch Nails — is starting to air Sunday on US public broadcaster PBS. It will also be broadcast, in slightly condensed form, on the French-German channel Arte from Tuesday.Burns, who co-directed The Vietnam War with Lynn Novick, called the $30-million project — reviewed at all stages by two dozen historians — the most ambitious of his career.""I feel an incredible sadness that the process is over,"" the 64-year-old Burns said.Burns said the television epic was ""in some ways like a Russian novel, an epic sweep across generations with lots of primary characters, secondary and tertiary characters"".As expected, Burns brings in decision-makers and rank-and-file soldiers. But he also found it vital to speak to people who did not fight in the war, which set off a protest movement in the United States whose divisions can still be felt today.""Courage could not always be on the battlefield,"" he said. ""It could be the decision not to go to war, to protest that war.""""But also, most importantly,"" he said, was including ""the voices of the Vietnamese, both our enemies and our allies, civilians, and to have a much fuller multidimensional portrait"".According to the Vietnamese government, more than three million civilians died in over the span of the war, along with over 2.5 million troops fighting for both the triumphant communist North and the US-allied South.US official figures say that 200,000 South Vietnamese and 58,200 US soldiers died and 1,638 GIs remain unaccounted for.""When the Americans talk about the Vietnam War they talk only about themselves and that is limiting. We were obligated to include all these other voices,"" he said.Burns said he was struck by the parallels when speaking to US troops and communist Viet Cong forces about their war experiences.""I think that if the Vietnamese are able to see the film, they're going to learn a lot, not just about us, not just what went on in the USA and the divisions, but as real human beings — as I hope that our American audience will begin to see the Vietnamese as real human beings who suffered an awful lot like them.""Making The Vietnam War, Burns and Novick collected an extraordinary quantity of archives, including more than 25,000 photographs and previously-unreleased recordings from presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon.""We edited for years and years — I'm even surprised it didn't take longer,"" Burns said.The film team went on two trips to Vietnam to interview veterans, who have far fewer opportunities than their US counterparts to express themselves publicly. Burns found startling frankness.""They're old enough, they're celebrated enough. They are at the end of their lives. It is possible now to relax a bit from the hard party-line. There's a kind of immunity that an old soldier gets,"" Burns said.Music was also a critical component of the film. Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross — his collaborator who has scored films such as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo — composed original music for The Vietnam War that is being released as a double-album.Burns called it an ""extraordinary combination of cold metallic electronic sound mitigated with a very beautiful melodious sensibility"".The documentary also brings in a composition by Chinese-American cellist Yo-Yo Ma and his Silk Road Ensemble that evokes Vietnamese traditions.""I think war offers us an opportunity to study human behaviour at its worst obviously but also at its best. And that's what we tried to cover,"" Burns said."
1747,"TORONTO: Martin McDonagh's darkly hilarious drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri won the Toronto film festival's audience prize for best picture on Sunday, giving it a leg up in the race for the Oscars.The rage-fueled film stars Frances McDormand as a frustrated and grieving mother, Mildred, who antagonizes police (Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell) while trying to call attention to a lack of progress in the hunt for her daughter's killer.Months have passed without an arrest in the murder case, so she commissions three signs with controversial messages for police along a road leading into the fictional Missouri town.But a backlash ensues. Mildred's friends and the freckle-faced and cocky young agent (Caleb Landry Jones) who rents her the billboard space are targeted by the chief's intellectually and emotionally stunted deputy, in violent reprisals that cost him his badge.Australia's Abbie Cornish and Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage also star in the film, which is McDonagh's third after In Bruges and Seven Psychopaths.In a statement, McDonagh called the win ""thrilling.""""You never really know if a story as heartfelt but also as outrageous and funny and unusual as ours has really connected to, you know, real people,"" he said.""So it's brilliant to hear that it has.""In Venice, where the film premiered, the British-Irish playwright said he wrote the script specifically for McDormand based on an idea that began to germinate 20 years ago when he was travelling across America by bus.A decade later, as he pondered a hard-to-explain billboard that had stuck in his mind — involving a mother whose daughter was raped and murdered — he began to flesh out a backstory.""Once I had decided it was a mother, the film wrote itself,"" he said. ""And picturing Frances in my mind helped me write it.""Runners-up for the festival's audience prize were Craig Gillespie's I, Tonya about disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding, and the coming-of-age drama Call Me By Your Name, directed by Luca Guadagnino.More than 300 feature and short films from 74 countries were screened at the Toronto festival, the biggest in North America.The event is often seen as a way for Oscar-conscious studios to generate buzz about their movies, with hundreds of filmmakers and actors walking the red carpet in Canada's largest city.In past years, films, such as Spotlight, 12 Years a Slave, and Slumdog Millionaire, have gone on from winning the audience prize in Toronto to taking top honours at the Oscars.Last year, the musical La La Land won the Toronto prize and then took home six Oscars, including best actress and best director — but not the top prize, despite the shocking mix-up with Moonlight at the end of the gala.Other accolades at the Toronto festival on Sunday went to Wayne Wapeemukwa for Luk' Luk'l and Robin Aubert for Les Affame, as well as to Huang Hsin-Yao for The Great Buddha+ and Warwick Thornton for Sweet Country.The International Federation of Film Critics awarded prizes to Sadaf Foroughi for Ava, about a rebellious girl in Iran who fights repression by her parents and society, and to Manuel Martin Cuenca for The Motive (El Autor).Mahour Jabbari, who played the titular Ava and her co-star Shayesteh Sajadi had been denied entry into Canada to attend the festival.Audiences also chose Joseph Kahn's satirical look at the brutal sport of battle rapping in Bodied over runners-up Craig Zahler's Brawl in Cell Block 99 and James Franco's The Disaster Artist for a Midnight Madness prize.Their pick for best documentary was Faces Places by Agnes Varda and street artist JR, which beat out Morgan Spurlock sequel's Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!, and Long Time Running, directed by Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas De Pencier."
1748,"KARACHI: Foreign Minister Khawaja Asif remarked that he failed to establish contact between Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz President Nawaz Sharif and Pakistan Peoples Party Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari.Speaking on Geo News programme, Capital Talk, Asif also shared that he had contacted Farooq Naek, who is the lawyer of PPP, to take up the Iqama (work permit) case against him. “He is my wife’s elder brother and my maternal cousin,” he shared.However, Naek refused to help me and said that Zardari has stopped him from taking up the case.In this regard, I tried to contact Zardari many times, even left messages for him with his ADC, claimed Asif. “But, Zardari didn’t answer any of my calls,” he added.“We have to work towards improving the political situation,” said the foreign minister, adding that “politicians shouldn’t make a drama of themselves.”When asked if there is a chance of PML-N and PPP working together, the minister said that he can not say anything for sure. “Personally speaking, I think there is no chance of contact between the two parties.”Asif was also asked why he thinks there is no chance of contact, Asif shared that he doesn't want to engage in speculation. Reacting to Imran’s tweets from earlier in the day, Asif said that none of the allegations levelled by Imran against Nawaz Sharif have proven to be true.If a person says the truth then he won’t have to remember all that he has said, he claimed. “I have never seen someone misstate the facts the way Imran does.”Pakistani Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairperson Imran Khan had denounced the protocol under which former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was taken to Punjab House from Islamabad airport Thursday morning. Asif also spoke about his speech in the Senate on October 1, in which he called out the failure of the United States' policy in neighbouring Afghanistan. Asif told lawmakers that the US policy for South Asia was actually targeted for Afghanistan.""The US generals, who faced defeat in Afghanistan in the last 15 years, have formed the structure for the policy for this region,” Asif had remarked.Explaining his speech, he said that when a policy is framed by generals who are losing a war, who have seen losses being incurred, had their territory lost, seen their investment being destroyed then it can’t be “a balanced policy.”'We will strongly protect our interests on the international forum and vis-à-vis our relations with the US'He also shared that there is a trust deficit between US and Afghanistan because one day or another, US officials make a statement “warning” Pakistan.Pakistan wants to co-exist with other nations with respect. “We are a nuclear power. We have worked hard to ensure peace in the country. Our soldiers have made countless sacrifices. We should be proud of these things,” he added.  Referring to his visit to the US, he remarked that his meeting with United States Secretary of State State Rex Tillerson was quite “pleasant”. “Tillerson is more understanding than other US officials, I have been in contact with,” he remarked. Asif also shared details of his meeting with US National Security Adviser HR McMaster. “As soon as McMaster came he stated that US has minimum trust in Pakistan and that Pakistan has failed to fulfil its commitments. I responded that if the US doesn’t trust us, then given our past we shouldn’t trust you at all.”Instead of responding to this, McMaster ended the meeting claiming that he has to go see the vice-president, Asif added. Speaking about the rift between PML-N members, he reiterated that these are just rumours. Even if there was a rift, then we would always give preference to politics.He added, “there is no disagreement between Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz.”Commenting on Nisar’s statements that conditions of PML-N are worse than 1999, he said that there is no such thing. “Our conditions are much better than in 1999.”On the PML-N meeting in London, he claimed “I didn’t even know there was meeting in London. News channels said I am attending the meeting while I was sitting in my office in Pakistan.”On general elections, he assured that the elections will be held on time. “We have to strengthen our democracy so that people start trusting us.”On August 16, PPP supremo Zardari had said that he has no interest in establishing contact with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, reported Geo News.Sources said the former president made the comments during a meeting of the party's core leadership at Bilawal House.Zardari said the PPP also has no interest in becoming part of a 'Grand National Dialogue' proposed recently by Nawaz Sharif.PPP co-chairman says he has received ten messages from Nawaz since the time he started taking a little heatSources quoted Zardari saying that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz chief has a different attitude when he is in power and a completely different tone when he is not. Zardari has reiterated his position time and again. On October 9, Zardari remarked in an interview that former president said a disqualified individual cannot become a party's president in a democratic system.He said that following his statement, Sharif, who was then the sitting prime minister, did not hold a meeting with him out of fear.His statement referred to an instance when Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were both in London nearly a year ago, where the latter approached the former for a meeting, according to some media reports.The PPP co-chairman had gone abroad in June 2015 and stayed in Dubai and London for nearly 18 months, following his controversial statement allegedly against the military.However, reports had suggested that Nawaz had declined to meet the former president. There had been no official word on the matter from either side.""I do not care about Nawaz Sharif's luncheon; I do not eat 'Paaye',"" he said, adding, ""I took my own meal along whenever I had a lunch with him.""The PPP co-chairman revealed that he has received ""ten messages from Nawaz Sharif since the time he started taking heat, but did not have a word with him.""""This is not a fight between Islamabad and Rawalpindi, but Nawaz wants to make it one,"" he said.On August 16, Asif had claimed that he can revive contact between PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif if he is instructed by the party’s high command.Speaking on Geo News’ Capital talk, Asif had said that he is certain that Zardari will agree to revive dialogue with the PML-N leadership.""Yes, if I am instructed by Nawaz Sharif, I can play a role to revive dialogue,"" said the foreign minister.The foreign minister said he is certain that Zardari will agree to revive dialogue with the PML-N leadership""I am a political worker. Politics is the name of possibilities. Doors are not kept shut forever.""However, PPP spokesperson Senator Farhatullah Babar said that as per the policy of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the party has decided to not maintain any contact with the PML-N leadership."
1749,"MOSCOW: Russia dismissed Thursday a report by a UN-led panel that blamed the Syrian regime for a sarin attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun and said the use of the substance was part of a ""theatrical performance"" by militants.A panel including diplomats and military officers presented Moscow's version of events complete with diagrams and satellite imagery, saying the Syrian regime did not carry the blame for the April attack which killed over 80 people.""We believe that the report turned out to be superficial, unprofessional and amateurish,"" said Mikhail Ulyanov, head of the foreign ministry's security and disarmament department.""The mission did their research from a distance, that in itself is a scandal.""He said, ""the use of sarin has been confirmed"" but insisted it was not delivered by an aerial bomb but rather used ""as a theatrical performance, a provocation"" by the rebels.At least 87 people died on April 4 this year when sarin nerve agent projectiles were fired into Khan Sheikhun, a town in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria.Images of dead and dying victims, including young children, in the aftermath of the attack provoked global outrage and a US cruise missile strike on a regime air base.A joint panel by the United Nations and the world's chemical watchdog Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that the Syrian regime was responsible and that the air force had dropped a bomb on the town, releasing the deadly nerve agent.Russia and Syria have, however, presented an alternative theory that an explosive device was set off on the ground. Ulyanov on Thursday suggested the sarin gas was poured inside the crater left by the bomb.Ulyanov spoke as part of a panel of the foreign ministry, air force and other Russian officials presenting slides that showed elaborate diagrams of regime warplanes' trajectories and satellite images in an effort to cast doubt on the UN report.The Russian officials also showed video footage of rescue personnel working in the crater wearing ""only respirators and cotton gloves.""Ulyanov claimed the video had been filmed after rebels detonated the bomb on the asphalt and before the sarin gas was poured into the crater.""If it were an aerial bomb, the bomb's tail would be in the crater, but there are no traces of an aerial bomb,"" he said.Ulyanov also said witnesses cited in the UN report were not confirmed to have been in the town on April 4 and ""could have been sunning themselves on a beach in the United Arab Emirates.""""The verdict against Damascus that has been issued so confidently turned out to be baseless,"" he said. ""You cannot issue a verdict against Damascus based on newspaper publications.""Ulyanov's intervention came after US President Donald Trump´s White House issued a string statement denouncing Moscow´s previous attempts to undermine the work of the UN-OPCW´s Joint Investigative Mechanism.""This unconscionable attack marks the fourth time that the JIM has confirmed that the Assad regime used chemical weapons, underscoring the brutal and horrifying barbarism of Bashar al-Assad and making the protection provided by Russia even more egregious,"" Trump´s spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee-Sanders said.""Russia's attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,"" she added.Despite criticising the work of the UN-OPCW on the report, Ulyanov said Russia would on Thursday present a draft resolution extending its mission in Syria, following a veto on a similar US proposal in the Security Council last week.Russia previously opposed renewing the mandate of the panel, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, prior to the release of the Khan Sheikhun report."
1750,"BAHAWALPUR: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on Thursday claimed that Nawaz Sharif failed to provide a single document as evidence to the Supreme Court in the Panama Papers case.Addressing a rally in Uch Sharif, Khan said the Supreme Court gave complete chance to Nawaz Sharif [to clarify] as to how did he send Rs300 billion abroad.""Nawaz Sharif lied and failed to present a single document as evidence,"" he said. ""When the JIT was formed, even then no evidence was provided to substantiate their claims.""The PTI chief questioned PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as to why was a criminal being given protocol.""What message is being conveyed? Does this mean one should not steal small things and go for bigger ones?"" he questioned, lamenting that prisons in the country are overcrowded with poor people involved in petty crimes.""The one who took away Rs300 billion asks why was he ousted,"" Khan took a jibe at Nawaz. ""You are attacking the courts to hide your corruption.""He said his party, after coming into power, will provide highest capital and facilities to farmers.Noting that Rs200 billion are being spent on Orange Line Train that covers only 27 kilometers, the PTI chairman said if a lesser amount is given to farmers, then it would bring prosperity in the country.He said the government helps weaker classes only if it receives money through taxation, but the money meant for public welfare is taken abroad.Khan said corruption devastates nations and the people in the country do not have resources to get their children educated nowadays.""Pakistanis purchased Rs800 billion worth properties in Dubai during the last four years,"" he said, adding, ""Had this amount been spent here, then people would have got jobs to support themselves.""The PTI chief said he never saw such smog in the country and said it was an ""alarm by the Almighty Allah.""""Minors are falling ill because of smog in Lahore. This is a message for the people to straighten themselves,"" he said.Khan said they planted one billion trees in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for they purify the air. ""We planted around 40 forests like Chhanga Manga; we will do more if we get a chance.""""We will turn the entire Pakistan green like the way we did in KP,"" he added."
1751,"TANGERANG: At least 46 people have been killed and dozens more injured in a blaze that tore through a fireworks factory outside Jakarta, police said Thursday, triggering explosions and sending plumes of black smoke into the air.Many of the charred corpses of victims were found clustered at the back of the factory in an industrial complex in Tangerang, police said, indicating there may have been a panicked rush to flee the flames.""We are still evacuating victims... there are 46 body bags. The evacuation is ongoing,"" Harry Kurniawan, Tangerang Kota police chief, told AFP.The police revised the death toll down to 46 from their earlier figure of 47, but said about 10 people remained unaccounted for.A firefighter at the scene said the victims had been burned beyond recognition.""Those who died are completely unrecognisable, totally burnt,"" Oni Sahroni told Metro TV.Parts of the building collapsed after being gutted by the blaze, which scorched nearby cars and motorbikes. Witnesses reported hearing blasts erupt from the site.Local resident Beni Benteng told AFP said he heard an explosion and people inside screaming for help.""My friends and I and some police officers knocked down a wall so people could escape, then the workers came out,"" he said.""I saw people including women were jumping from above, oh my God,"" he added.The blaze, which broke out in the morning, was brought under control by late afternoon and authorities were working to recover the victims´ bodies from the building.Authorities have not yet said how the fire started, but have confirmed it began near the front door and quickly spread.""Victims were found piling at the back, it seems like they were avoiding the blaze at the front door,"" Afinta told Metro TV.Desperate friends and family thronged a nearby police hospital in Kramat Jati looking for loved ones.Some relatives wept openly outside the hospital as victims, covered in bandages, were laid out in stretchers, while others with minor injuries sat in the hospital´s hallways or outside.A factory worker at the hospital in Kramat Jati said the fire erupted in the middle of production.""I don´t know how it happened, I was working outside of the factory and there were some explosions, four cars exploded and almost all motorbikes also exploded,"" Ade, who suffered burns to his arms and legs, told AFP.The factory -- part of a complex that borders a residential area -- had only been operating for six weeks, district government official Toni Rustoni told Metro TV.Some relatives of victims have already begun demanding action from the company.Diana, whose 15-year-old sister was seriously injured in the fire, said the company, Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses, must not ignore the victims.""Don´t neglect her -- the insurance, the treatment, they must pay for everything,"" she told Metro TV through tears.Deadly fires are not uncommon in Indonesia due to poor safety standards that are routinely flouted.Seventeen people killed when a fire ripped through a karaoke bar on Sulawesi island in 2015.In 2009, a fire killed 20 people at a karaoke bar in Medan, on Sumatra island."
1752,"A 6,000-year-old skull found in Papua New Guinea is likely the world's oldest-known tsunami victim, experts said Thursday after a new analysis of the area it was found in.The partially preserved Aitape Skull was discovered in 1929 by Australian geologist Paul Hossfeld, 12 kilometres (seven miles) inland from the northern coast of the Pacific nation.It was long thought to belong to Homo erectus (upright man), an extinct species thought to be an ancestor of the modern human that died out some 140,000 years ago.But more recent radiocarbon dating estimated it was closer to 6,000 years old, making it a member of our own species -- Homo sapiens. At that time, sea levels were higher and the area would have been near the coast.An international team led by the University of New South Wales returned to the site to collect the same geological deposits observed by Hossfeld.Back in the lab, they studied details of the sediment including its grain size and geochemical composition, which can help identify a tsunami inundation.They also identified a range of microscopic organisms from the ocean in the sediment, similar to those found in soil after a devastating tsunami hit the region in 1998.""We have discovered that the place where the Aitape Skull was unearthed was a coastal lagoon that was inundated by a large tsunami about 6,000 years ago,"" said study author and UNSW scientist James Goff.""It was similar to the one that struck nearby with such devastating effect in 1998, killing more than 2,000 people.""We conclude that this person who died there so long ago is probably the oldest-known tsunami victim in the world.""The conclusions, aided by researchers from the United States, France, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, are published in the journal PLOS ONE.Goff, a world authority on tsunamis, said while the bones of the skull had been well-studied previously, little attention had been paid to the sediments where they were unearthed.""The geological similarities between these sediments and the sediments laid down during the 1998 tsunami made us realise that human populations in this area have been affected by these massive inundations for thousands of years,"" he said.""After considering a range of possible scenarios, we believe that, on the balance of the evidence, the individual was either killed directly in the tsunami, or was buried just before it hit and the remains were redeposited.""Following the 1998 tsunami, which penetrated up to five kilometres inland, attempts to retrieve victims were called off after a week because crocodiles were feeding on the corpses, leading to their dismemberment.This may also explain why the skull of the person who died 6,000 years ago was found on its own, without any other bones, the researchers said.World attention has been drawn to the devastating impact of tsunamis in recent decades, particularly following those in Indonesia in 2004 and Japan in 2011, which killed about 230,000 and 16,000 people respectively.But research in the Pacific has shown that throughout history and prehistory, the region has seen repeated catastrophic tsunamis that have caused death, abandonment of settlements, breakdown of trading routes and even war, the study said.""This work reinforces a growing recognition that tsunamis have had a significant influence on coastal populations throughout Pacific prehistory and doubtless elsewhere as well,"" said study co-author Darren Curnoe, also from UNSW."
1753,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman National Accountability Bureau Justice (retd) Javed Iqbal on Thursday said PPP leader Shajeel Memon was arrested in compliance with orders issued from an accountability court in Karachi.In a statement released by the accountability body, the chairman NAB said there was no injustice in Memon's arrest and added that accountability would be carried out in accordance with the law and without any discrimination.Iqbal further added that Memon's case is being heard in the court of law and the warrants for the arrest were authorised by the same court. Earlier, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Khursheed Shah said the arrest of Memon tarnished the image of NAB. The veteran Pakistan Peoples Party member and opposition leader, while criticising the arrest, said that those who have non-bailable arrest warrants get bail within an hour.Former Sindh information minister was arrested on Monday along with 11 other suspects after bail dismissal in Rs5.7bn corruption caseOn Monday, after being holed up for hours in the Sindh High Court following his bail dismissal in a corruption case. Memon was taken into custody by the NAB along with the other suspects.The former minister was escorted from the court premises by Rangers and NAB personnel and was surrounded by his lawyers and other supporters. As he was leaving the court, resistance was offered by his supporters leading to an exchange of hot words with NAB officials.Eleven other accused in the case were also arrested by the bureau. ""The accused persons are charged for embezzlement of Rs. 5,766,479,766 purportedly paid to seven advertising agencies for awareness campaigns between 2013 and 2015,"" said a press release by NAB.Memon was attempting to avoid being arrested by NAB after the cancellation of his bail extension plea by the Sindh High court earlier on Monday.The suspects are accused of corruption worth Rs5.76 billion in the award of advertisements of the Sindh government’s awareness campaigns in the electronic media.Memon, who returned to Pakistan in March this year after ending his near two-year-long self-imposed exile, was arrested on his arrival by NAB but later obtained bail.The other accused in the case include bureaucrats, officials of the information department and members of private advertising agencies.Memon claims the charges against him are politically motivated."
1754,"CAIRO: Egyptian human rights lawyer and opposition leader Khaled Ali said on Monday he would challenge President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in the 2018 presidential election, provided he is not barred from the contest.Ali is the first person to announce he is running against Sisi — a former military commander who led the ouster of former President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood over four years ago.Ali told a news conference he would have a socialist platform, aiming to end austerity and redistribute wealth and fight terrorism without compromising freedom.He criticized Sisi’s administration, accusing it of suppressing freedoms and causing deteriorating economic and security conditions.“In spite of all the darkness, there is still hope. I call on all segments of society to unite in collective struggle to reclaim this hope and to rescue this nation,” he said.“It is because of this that I have decided today to launch a presidential campaign.”Sisi himself has yet to declare if he will run but is widely expected to do so. He won 97 percent of the vote in 2014.Many in Egypt see him as vital to stability in a country where unrest since 2011 has battered the economy.Under Sisi’s presidency, thousands of dissidents have been jailed. The government has shut down independent media and heavily restricted the conducting of opinion polls.Ali said earlier on Monday security forces had raided a printing press and seized materials for his campaign, after media reports that he was expected to announce his candidacy.Security forces accused the owner of the press of printing “documents that harm national security”, Ali told Reuters.State news agency MENA said a “high ranking security source” denied police had raided a printing press.If it appeared elections were being rigged, Ali said, he would call for a boycott by opposition candidates, forcing Sisi to be the sole contender.Egypt’s presidency could not be reached for comment on Ali’s plan to run.State-owned newspaper al-Gomhuriya ran an article on Monday with the headline “Khaled Ali and the ploys of dwarves”, attacking him as an attention-seeker.It said Ali had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and received illegal foreign funding. It did not provide evidence for its claims, which Ali denies.A Cairo court sentenced Ali in September to three months in jail for public indecency, over an allegedly rude hand gesture.Ali has appealed, denying the charges which he says are politically motivated. If the guilty verdict is upheld he will not be allowed to run, even if he is not jailed.The 45-year-old gained prominence in January when he won a case that nullified a government transfer of two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, a deal that had prompted mass protests. It was after winning that case that Ali is alleged to have made the gesture.Egypt’s reclaiming of the islands would be a cornerstone of his campaign, he said. He told Reuters in an interview in June the case had swayed the opinion of many former Sisi supporters who oppose ceding sovereign territory.Ali ran for president in 2012 and came seventh. He was the youngest candidate at 40, the minimum age required to run.He now leads the leftwing Bread and Freedom Party, at least eight of whose members have been arrested since April on charges including “misusing social media to incite against the state” and insulting the president."
1755,"BRUSSELS: Younger women and children are now more often involved in the already increasing number of terrorist activities in Europe, the continent's security agency revealed in its latest report.The UK, for instance, is one of the countries that has seen a bump up in the number of women, families, and minors getting engaged in extremist plots, despite the fact that they remain a small proportion of the overall travellers.The EU Terrorism Situation and Trend Report comes just before the EU summit set to be held in Luxembourg next week, wherein various leaders will sit to discuss measures to 'un-radicalise' the region.According to the report, this particular demographic ""are playing increasingly operational roles in committing terrorist activities independently in the EU"".The publication further states that the average age at travelling time of those participating in such events has reduced significantly; nearly half of the travellers aged 18 and below have departed since the declaration of Daesh's 'caliphate’ back in July 2014.Poland said that those of its citizens who travelled were all under 22 years of age. While overall figures for the EU are not available, of much more concern is the fact that by the last year-end, the Netherlands registered a total of over 40 children (age 0-12 years) who travelled to Iraq or Syria with their parents.Austria, on the other hand, noted that women and minors either go or want to go to the conflict zones and that some women married foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) in Syria under the Islamic law, partly through the help of social media.Denmark stipulated that only a few people left the country in 2016. Of these, the vast majority were young women. It is noteworthy that women, in general, account for nearly an eighth of the total outbound travellers.A higher number of women play an active, independent role within the militant circles in Denmark, the latest report noted, adding that this may consequently have an increasingly radicalising effect on their associates and families.Belgium, however, reported that the returning women and children are a bigger concern due to female activists' apparent involvement in the preparation of the attacks. Some may also have received military training during their tours abroad. In addition, Daesh propaganda has repeatedly called for the training and indoctrination of minors.On the flipside, Spain experienced a decline in the number of women detained in 2016 and that only one of them was willing to travel to the conflict zone.The average age of arrestees in Spain was 31, which reflects a 2-year increase from the previous reporting period. A minor was taken into care due to his parents’ arrest after they attempted to travel to the conflict zone.At least 86 lives were taken when a truck rammed through the crowds during July festivities in Nice, while the Brussels bombings in 2016 left 32 deadAs per the report, one of every four (25 percent) taken into custody last year were women, as opposed to almost 18 percent in 2015. More recently, 22-year-old Manchester suicide bomber Salman Abedi allegedly got instructions on how to construct an explosive device.""Some 142 terrorist plots had also been foiled in eight EU states last year. Over 70 were stopped in the UK alone, followed by 23 in France, 17 in Italy, and 10 in Spain, among others,"" EUobserver, an independent online newspaper, stated citing Europol's report.In 2016, there were 13 reported attacks in total, with five in France and four in Belgium and Germany each, BBC reported, adding that 135 people died in these.Inclusive of the 429 suspected extremists detained in France, there were 718 arrests in total.Interestingly, more than 25% of these were women."

The scandal has rocked the Malaysian governing class, exposing Prime Minister Najib Razak to allegations of corruption, which he has denied.A spokesman for DiCaprio said in a statement that the 42-year-old actor had contacted the US Justice Department last July after learning of a civil action against ""certain parties involved in the making of 'The Wolf of Wall Street,'"" a movie in which DiCaprio starred.He offered to surrender to US authorities any gifts ""from the parties named in the civil complaint.""DiCaprio ""initiated return of these items,"" said the statement provided to AFP.

1759,"LOS ANGELES: Fifteen years after her horrific gang rape by a local clan in her village in Pakistan, Mukhtar Mai is reliving her ordeal -- and courageousness -- through a US opera inspired by her story.""I was very emotional when I first started watching it and began reliving the incident in my mind,"" Mai, 37, told AFP on Friday, after attending the Los Angeles premiere of ""Thumbprint.""""But then as the opera progressed, it became easier to watch and I felt more courage,"" she said in Urdu, speaking through a translator.The opera, by composer Kamala Sankaram and librettist Susan Yankowitz, recounts Mai´s 2002 rape and her decision to defy her attackers and take them to court -- an unusual move in male-dominated society, where a woman who suffers such a crime often commits suicide rather than endure the stigma and shame associated with it.""Thumbprint"" first opened in New York in 2014 but Mai had never seen the opera. She traveled this week from her home in the remote Pakistani village of Meerwala to attend the West Coast premiere.While the story onstage ends when Mai´s rapists have been sentenced to death, in reality her attackers walk free -- seemingly going about their daily life with total impunity after their sentences were overturned on appeal.The men had raped Mai -- with the approval of the village council -- as a punishment after her 12-year-old brother was falsely accused of having an illicit relationship with a woman from the dominant clan in the village.""My rapists live across from my house and I try not to cross paths with them,"" said Mai, who used compensation money from her case to start several schools and a women´s shelter in her village. ""When I walk past, they taunt me and make catcalls.""In an added strange twist to her story, the children of her rapists attend her school, and the daughters of some of the village elders who ordered her rape have sought refuge at her shelter.""Even though some members of my own family were outraged, I told them I could not turn away the kids as the school is here to serve everyone in the community,"" she said.Mai, who married in 2009 and has three children, acknowledged that her story had empowered women in her village and beyond, giving them courage to stand for their rights.But she said she held little hope that the legal system in her country would ever render her justice.""All four of the men who raped me and the two village elders who ordered the rape are free,"" she said. ""And they will only learn that what they did is a crime if they are punished.""She said she had grown tired of being the woman everyone points to because of her ordeal, in contrast to her rapists who are unconcerned and will likely never pay for their crime.""I am the one who is always interviewed and put forward in this case,"" she sighed. ""Why doesn´t anyone confront them, why doesn´t anyone point them out in the street and say, ´These are the people who committed horrific acts against Mukhtar Mai?´""She said she receives threatening messages daily on her telephone, Facebook page or in person and is now afraid for the safety of her children.""I have reported nearly 35 such threatening calls and incidents and only one person was arrested, but even he was let out on bail,"" she said. ""I want to make it known that if anything happens to me or my children and family members, the Pakistani government is responsible.""As for the opera inspired by her story, she doubts it could ever be shown in Pakistan, where it would certainly hit a nerve.But, she said, ""I would like it to be shown everywhere.""""And I would like for the people who committed this crime to be identified and come face to face with what they did."""
1760,"BEIJING: Standing in a dimly-lit gallery space in China's National Museum, the owner of the world's only privately-held Vermeer gazed at the small oil painting for a long moment, before showing it to the assembled press.Since American billionaire Tom Kaplan purchased the piece in 2008, it has spent most of its time on loan to various museums around the world.When the investor -- who made his fortune betting on precious metals and natural gas -- and his wife began buying up works by 17th century Dutch painters in 2003, their goal was to take ""paintings from the private domain and return them to the public"", he said.Now the collection is set to find its biggest audience yet when a selection of around 70 of its more than 250 works goes on show from Saturday through September 3 just steps from the mausoleum of Communist China's founder Mao Zedong on Tiananmen Square.China is the first stop on a world tour of the works, known as the Leiden Collection after the Dutch town where many of its contributors plied their trade during the European nation's golden age.After three months in Beijing, the exhibition will move to a private museum in Shanghai before heading to Russia and then the United Arab Emirates.The National Museum, according to officials, has passed the Louvre to become the world's most visited, and if all goes according to plan, the exhibition will see hundreds of thousands of visitors flood through its doors.While the Vermeer is a showstopper, the exhibit is built around the Kaplans' collection of 11 Rembrandts and focuses on the artist's evolution and influence on his contemporaries.It is a major step towards achieving the couple's goal of promoting the Dutch master's legacy to an international audience, an effort which Kaplan believes will be greatly boosted by a positive reception in China.""The cultural influence of China is going to multiply in the next decade,"" he said, adding that the painter's future will ""be very different depending on the way China reacts to his art"".""The country will hopefully embrace Rembrandt for the genius he is.""Kaplan expresses a fervent belief in the transformative power of art, promoting his favourite painter with an almost missionary zeal.The investor discovered the artist during a visit to the New York Museum of Metropolitan Art when he was six years old, sparking a life-long obsession with the Dutch master.He and his wife began collecting Rembrandts after a chance encounter in 2003 with a renowned art expert, who informed him that many of the paintings remained in private hands and were available for purchase.The couple soon began snatching up works from the era, buying ""on average a painting a week for five years,"" Kaplan said.He believes Rembrandt's power lies in his universality and the revolutionary message hidden in his work: ""Beauty is truth. It's humanity. That's our salvation.""Rembrandt lived in an era when the Netherlands was a global trading powerhouse in the 17th century, something that should resonate with many Chinese visitors to the exhibition, who are grappling with their own country's sudden access to wealth.""We believe very strongly that perhaps uniquely Rembrandt can serve as (a) bridge,"" he said.""(Rembrandt) is truly a universal artist from whose DNA we've seen art all over the world be able to find its freedom and liberation.""As attendees leave the exhibition, they will be confronted by a wall of paintings captioned with an admonition to ""Beware of Riches.""It is a timely, if perhaps unintentional, warning for a country that is grappling with rampant corruption, as well as a spiritual malaise linked to what many see as increasingly pervasive materialism.While the exhibition is expected to receive a warm welcome in China, the underlying message might find a less eager audience.The concept of ""universal values"" is not a popular one in modern China, where the government of President Xi Jinping has demonstrated an almost reflexive distaste for the kinds of ""Western"" ideals Kaplan embraces.But the billionaire has no interest in lecturing. Rembrandt, he said, speaks for himself."
1761,"WASHINGTON: Republican lawmakers on Monday began revising their proposed overhaul of the US tax code, as Democrats pointed to the loss of popular deductions as proof the legislation was an assault on the middle class.A draft bill unveiled last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives, if enacted, would be the biggest restructuring of the tax system since the 1980s and the first major legislative victory of the Trump presidency.Although Republicans generally support the bill’s broader themes, including a sharp cut in the corporate income tax, there are rumblings of dissent over other elements, including repeal of the deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments.New York, California, and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of that deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump’s plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector.“There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who will be big losers under this bill,” Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey — a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee — said as the tax-writing panel convened to consider the bill.The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.The linchpin of the plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and the establishment of a 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, which currently pay income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent.An analysis of the plan released on Monday by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the wealthy would be the biggest beneficiaries, while more than one-quarter of taxpayers would see a tax hike over 10 years.The top 1 percent of earners — with annual incomes of more than $730,000 — would receive a $37,000 tax cut, representing 22 percent of the total tax cut for individuals in 2018.By 2027, they would get 50 percent of the total benefit, according to the analysis.With Democrats united in opposition to the plan, Republican defections from a few traditionally Democratic-leaning states could be enough to torpedo it in the House.Republican Representative Kevin Brady — the chairman of the House tax-writing panel — pledged that lawmakers would have a chance to propose changes to the bill.“Let me assure you this is the beginning of the tax reform process,” he told the committee.Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it.In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Brady said another change would be a “carried interest” provision that lengthened to two years the time assets need to be held in order to be eligible for a lower tax rate.Carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits — typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors — that goes to the general partners of private equity, venture capital, and hedge funds.Under current law, high-income fund partners pay the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent on their carried interest income, instead of the 39.6 percent individual tax rate that applies to the ordinary wage income of high earners.President Donald Trump promised to close the loophole, which has benefited some of Wall Street’s wealthiest financiers.Securing congressional passage of the tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year.Investors are adding to the pressure.The expectation of deep tax cuts has helped fuel a stock market rally during Trump's time as president, with the broad S&P 500 index up about 14 percent.The Senate — where Republicans have a 52-48 majority — is developing its own version of the tax legislation, which would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to Trump for signing.Several Republican senators have said they would have a problem voting for any tax bill that significantly increased the deficit.The House bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt.Fitch Ratings said on Monday that the House bill could add to the fiscal strain in some states and local jurisdictions by limiting their tax-raising flexibility.Republican leaders are pushing for the House to vote on a revised tax bill before the US Thanksgiving holiday on November 23. They have said a draft Senate bill could be ready at the end of this week.The Republican tax plan was devised without Democratic input.The last major tax restructuring, Republican former President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 overhaul, received significant input and support from Democrats."
1762,"NEW YORK: Oil prices surged to their highest since July 2015 on Monday as Saudi Arabia’s crown prince cemented his power with a crackdown on corruption, while shares worldwide were little changed and key currencies stayed in tight ranges.US crude broke above $56 a barrel for the first time in more than two years as Mohammed bin Salman’s clampdown on graft led to arrests of royals, ministers, and investors, including prominent billionaire investor Alwaleed bin Talal.Brent crude futures were trading about 3.5 percent higher at $64.23 a barrel by 4:30 PM ET.Prince Mohammed’s reforms include a plan to list parts of state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco next year, with higher oil prices seen as beneficial for the market capitalization of the future listed company.The crackdown spurred concerns of Middle Eastern money pulling out of global financial markets.A weekend call by China’s central bank governor for tougher financial regulation also hit global investor sentiment.The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.11 percent.The pan-European STOXX 600 closed 0.13 percent higher.Saudi Arabia’s own stock market fell as much as 1.5 percent before ending 0.1 percent higher, boosted in part by government-linked fund buying.Sentiment toward the US dollar was positive, with leveraged funds paring bearish bets to be net long for the first time since late July.“There is some ongoing adjustment in market expectations on the dollar’s outlook on the progress of the US tax bill and on the ongoing Saudi situation but market moves have been in narrow ranges,” Alberto Gallo — the head of macro strategies at Algebris Investments in London — said.All three major US equity indexes closed at record highs, with investors focused on what could be the biggest merger ever in the technology sector.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index hit a record high above its 6,786.436 close following news that chip maker Broadcom Ltd made an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.23 points (or 0.04 percent) to 23,548.42, while the S&P 500 gained 3.29 points (or 0.13 percent) to 6,786.44.The US dollar was little changed after investors took profits on its best weekly performance this year, with wariness about the status of the US economy and tax reform plans setting the tone.Facing pockets of discontent in their own Republican ranks, tax negotiators in the US House of Representatives will seek to bridge differences over their far-reaching tax bill and stick to a self-imposed deadline of passage this month.The index that measures the greenback against a basket of currencies fell 0.24 percent, with the euro up 0.03 percent to $1.1611.The Japanese yen strengthened 0.30 percent versus the greenback at 113.75 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3173, up 0.76 percent on the day.The spread between two-year and 10-year US Treasury yields was the narrowest in more than a decade as sluggish domestic inflation underpinned demand for longer-maturity government bonds.Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were last up 7/32 in price to yield 2.3181 percent — from 2.343 percent late on Friday.The Federal Reserve confirmed on Monday that William Dudley, one of the most influential monetary policymakers throughout the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath, expects to retire by mid-2018, leaving the leadership of the US central bank unusually wide open.The 30-year bond was last up 16/32 in price to yield 2.7973 percent, from 2.822 percent late on Friday.Spot gold was up 0.94 percent at $1,281.41 an ounce."
1763,"Icelandic actor Sverrir Gudnason who plays opposite Hollywood star Shia LaBeouf in the newly released Borg-McEnroe movie admits he had never played tennis before landing the role as the 1980s Swedish icon.The youthful looking 39-year-old Gudnason was born in Sweden but grew up in Iceland, and bears a striking resemblance to Borg, whose cool personality contrasted to the fieriness of his on-court rival John McEnroe.""I had never seen a whole tennis game before all this,"" Gudnason told AFP in an interview.""I had never even been on a tennis court in my life and (for the film) I didn't just learn to play tennis, I learned to play tennis like Bjorn Borg.""The actor said he had almost turned the role down because he had never played the game.""I didn't feel close to him, I didn't feel like an athlete and I was kind of thinking of turning it down,"" said Gudnason, who told producers he demanded physical back-up preparing for the role.""I played two hours per day for half a year getting the strokes right,"" he said, insisting the person himself was fascinating too.""I built the character by looking back on old footage from the 80s, not by calling him and asking him how he would do this or that.""He also enjoyed the on-screen experience with LaBeouf, who played McEnroe.""It was great, he's a great actor and a good man and he came in with a lot of energy and devotion to the film,"" he explained.Gudnason did not actually meet Borg himself until the Swedish premiere in Stockholm.""He said he was very moved by my performance. I'd been very nervous about meeting him,"" he said.Borg, now 61, is on record as saying Gudnason certainly looks like him.""He's really mentally strong,"" Gudnason said of Borg.""The superstitions and rituals he had... he loved routine, so he didn't have to worry about anything.""In a way it's trying to control everything to make stuff easier for himself.""Gudnason says although time has moved on Borg still looms large in the Swedish psyche.""All the news is about Zlatan (Ibrahimovic) now but Bjorn Borg is still the king, he's like ABBA, you have these big Swedish things and he's one of them,"" he said comparing the tennis player to the nation's most famous pop group.The actor confessed to enjoying football above all else -- and admitted he got worked up following Iceland's unlikely football success.""The great thing about watching sports is that it can feel so important at the time,"" he said, referring to Iceland's recent qualification for its first ever World Cup finals.""This is like the golden years for Icelandic soccer,"" he said -- admitting that if Sweden played Iceland he would root for Iceland as the underdog."
1764,"Manchester City’s eight point advantage after 11 games is leading to talk of the Premier League title race being over in November, but as Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho noted - English football has a habit of throwing up surprises.It is undeniable that City are currently playing with such a verve, fluency and effectiveness that it is hard to imagine them losing three games and allowing their rivals, whether it be United, Spurs or Chelsea, into the race.But while the form of Pep Guardiola’s team and - second-placed United’s recent losses to Huddersfield and Chelsea - point towards a runaway title win, there is indeed lot of football left to be played.“Eight points in the Premier League is not the same in Portugal, La Liga or the Bundesliga. Yes, it is eight points but there is still a lot of play (to come),” Mourinho said after the loss at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, which followed City’s comfortable 3-1 win over Arsenal.While Mourinho was not explicit in his explanation, the fact is that suspensions and injuries to key players happen and, over the course of a long season, can radically impact a team’s form.And while City certainly have plenty of quality, their strength in depth has not yet been truly tested.Guardiola was already talking about his team being tired after their midweek trip to Naples in the Champions League. How will they be holding up physically after a fixture-congested festive season? How will they cope in February when they will be in knockout action in the Champions League?City made a strong start last season but then suffered successive defeats - to Chelsea and Leicester City - at the start of December before ending that month with a loss at Anfield on New Year’s Eve.United host City at Old Trafford on Dec. 10 - a game which Mourinho surely has his eye on already as a chance to reign in the leaders and he suggested that his team will be stronger with some key figures set to return.“I hope, feel, think and wish that in the busy period at the end of November, December and January, we’re going to be at maximum strength with (Paul) Pogba, (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic and (Marcus) Rojo back (from injury),” he said.Certainly, United’s stumble in form after their excellent start of six wins from seven games, has coincided with the absence of French midfielder Pogba, whose partnership in central midfield with Nemanja Matic was developing so well.Romelu Lukaku’s goal drought has had a bigger impact given the absence of an alternative central striker and the return of Ibrahimovic, who had scored 17 goals in 28 Premier League games before his knee ligament injury, would give Mourinho another option.While the focus is on United’s challenge, it is worth noting that Tottenham are level on points with them and after their crushing of European champions Real Madrid last week, a long winning run from Mauricio Pochettino’s team cannot be ruled out.But while Guardiola is right to play down talk of an inevitable title win, he couldn’t help highlighting one key difference from last season - his team’s performances against top six clubs.“Last season against title contenders, we were able to win just twice. Coming into November, we have already beaten Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal,” he said.Six days after December’s clash with United, Guardiola’s side face Tottenham at the Etihad and then on Jan. 14 they are at Anfield, where their title bid unravelled last year.If City can triumph in those games then perhaps talk of a one-horse race can be justified. But as Mourinho says, there is a lot of football left to be played."
1765,"LONDON: British political party leaders agreed on Monday to introduce new safeguards for parliamentary staff, as Prime Minister Theresa May called for a ""culture of respect"" in Westminster amid a slew of sleaze and sexual harassment allegations.The leaders of Britain's main political parties met in parliament to give the go-ahead for a new grievance procedure and a face-to-face human resources service, upgrading an existing complaints hotline.The new service will be in place by the end of the month, while the grievance procedure will be introduced next year, May told reporters after the meeting with opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and others.""I'm sorry that we have seen these abuses of power — too many taking place over too many years,"" she said.""And the fact that they have taken place here at our seat of democracy should be a matter of shame for us all.""About a dozen MPs from both May's Conservative Party and the Labour Party have been accused of harassment in recent days and the government has admitted serious failures in reporting procedures.Defence Secretary Michael Fallon resigned last week and First Secretary of State Damian Green, May's deputy, is under investigation by the government over the claims, some of which date back several years.Speaking to the Confederation of British Industry ahead of the meeting, May had called for the new measures.""We need to establish a new culture of respect at the centre of our public life,"" she said.She added the new culture should be ""one in which everyone can feel confident that they are working in a safe and secure environment, where complaints can be brought forward without prejudice and victims know that those complaints will be investigated properly"".But May also said ""people's careers cannot be damaged by unfounded rumours circulated anonymously online"" after many claims made via social media.""Of course, people can be friends with their colleagues and consensual relationships can develop at work — this isn't about prying into private lives,"" she said.On Friday, May announced a new code of conduct for the Conservative Party — under which several MPs were referred for investigation this weekend.Two Labour lawmakers have also been suspended, another is facing an investigation by the party and a fourth has apologised for making women feel ""uncomfortable"".One change that has been mooted is to make MPs' staff direct employees of parliament rather than of the politicians themselves — an anomaly that has made some harassment victims reluctant to come forward.Home Secretary Amber Rudd said on Sunday the scandals were a ""watershed moment"" that was ""clearing out"" inappropriate behaviour but the interior minister denied May's minority government was at risk.Fallon announced his resignation on Wednesday after apologising for touching a journalist's knee in 2002.Another journalist alleged this weekend that Fallon had ""lunged"" at her after a lunch in 2003.She said she reported the incident to Downing Street this week, and he resigned hours later.Green meanwhile is being investigated for his own alleged inappropriate behaviour towards a journalist, which he strongly denies.Rudd confirmed that the probe had been widened to include a newspaper report on Sunday that ""extreme"" pornographic material had been found on his parliamentary computer in 2008.Green has strongly denied the story in The Sunday Times and accused the police source behind it of trying to cause him political damage.Also on Sunday, Conservative lawmaker Chris Pincher resigned from his role as a whip — enforcing party discipline — and referred himself to the party's complaints procedure and the police following allegations over his behaviour.The move followed a report in The Mail on Sunday newspaper that Pincher was accused of making an unwanted pass at former Olympic rower and Conservative activist Alex Story."
1766,"As climate change impacts strengthen, poor people and countries vulnerable to rising sea level, droughts, hurricanes and floods need to be the focus of this year's UN climate talks — and governments need to act faster to protect them, campaigners said on Monday.For the first time, the talks, which opened in Bonn Monday, are being presided over by a small island state — Fiji, which is already facing problems from rising seas that forced one coastal village to move in 2014.As millions worldwide are affected by increasingly frequent climate shocks, developing countries lack the resources to cope with the next disaster, said Harjeet Singh, ActionAid International's global lead on climate change.The talks need ""to represent the interests of all vulnerable countries and people"", he said on the sidelines of the negotiations.Vital to that is making progress in raising money to help countries recover from disasters, and adapt their lives and economies to the changing climate, he said.Richer countries have promised to raise $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poorer nations make that transition — though many experts say the figure is well below what is needed.""The Fijian presidency has a moral responsibility to make sure we make huge progress around (climate finance),"" Singh said.""We need to have tangible outcomes from (these talks). We can't leave (here) and say to people affected by disasters: 'Sorry guys, you're on your own.'""A group representing 12 Pacific island nations on Monday urged the government leaders to act quickly.More than two decades of climate negotiations have not yet delivered enough action to protect homes and jobs from dangerous climate change, said members of the Pacific Climate Warriors group.""In the Pacific, the impacts of climate change are not a debate, it is our reality. We no longer have time to talk. Now is the time to act,"" said the young islanders, part of a network of Pacific youth fighting climate change.UN climate leaders on Monday agreed that countries need to act quickly and with an ambition to cut planet-warming emissions and to help the millions of people whose lives have been devastated by natural disasters.""Never before have we met with a greater sense of urgency,"" Patricia Espinosa — the head of the UN Climate Change Secretariat — said.""Millions of people have suffered and continue to suffer from extreme weather events… (and) the fact is that this may only be the start, a preview of what is to come,"" she said.""We no longer have the luxury of time. We must act now.""Limiting global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — less than half a degree higher than today — ""is a matter of survival for many vulnerable nations around the world"", Genevieve Jiva — a Fijian and project officer at the Pacific Islands Climate Action Network — said.To achieve the goal, countries must work swiftly and immediately to phase out coal and other fossil fuels, she said.""Developed countries and major polluters need to understand that their fossil fuels is the Pacifics' loss and damage,"" she said.Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama urged governments at the opening ceremony to keep global warming in control, or face more people being exposed to destruction and suffering.""We are all in the same canoe,"" he said.—via Thomson Reuters Foundation"
1767,"SUTHERLAND SPRINGS: The gunman who shot 26 worshipers to death and wounded 20 others at a Texas church was embroiled in a domestic dispute with his in-laws and had been sending threatening messages to his wife’s mother before the massacre, officials said Monday.The killer, Devin Kelley, 26, was previously convicted by court-martial of assaulting his first wife and step-son while serving in the US Air Force and spent a year in detention before his bad-conduct discharge in 2014, according to the Pentagon.The Air Force acknowledged on Monday that it failed to enter Kelley’s 2012 domestic violence offence into a US government database used by licensed gun dealers for conducting background checks on firearms purchasers.A sporting goods retail chain has said Kelley passed background checks when he bought a gun in 2016 and a second firearm the following year.Details about Kelley’s background of violent, disturbing behaviour emerged a day after Sunday’s rampage in southeastern Texas, which ranks as the deadliest mass shooting by a lone gunman in the state and one of the five most lethal in modern US history.Kelley was found dead, apparently of gunshot wounds, after a failed attempt to make his getaway from the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, authorities said.Stepping out of the church, Kelley was confronted and shot three times by an armed area resident. Kelley then fled in a sports utility vehicle (SUV) as the resident waved down a passing motorist.The two good Samaritans then chased after the suspect at high speeds, authorities said.Freeman Martin — a spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety — credited the man who shot Kelley as “our Texas hero”.Kelley called his father during the pursuit to say he had been shot and might not survive, officials said.He later crashed his vehicle, shot himself and died, they added. It was not clear if he died of the self-inflicted wound or those sustained in the gunfight, officials said.It appeared that family problems may have been a factor in Sunday’s carnage.Kelley was involved in a domestic dispute with the family of Danielle Shields, a woman he married in 2014, and the situation had flared up, according to officials and public records.“There was a domestic situation going on within the family and the in-laws,” Martin told reporters outside the church on Monday. “The mother-in-law attended the church… she had received threatening text messages from him.”Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tacit said the family members were not in the church during Kelley’s attack.Kelley himself had attended services at the church at times, US Senator Ted Cruz of Texas told reporters at the scene.“My understanding is that this depraved madman had worshipped at this church before,” Cruz said.The attack came about a month after a gunman killed 58 people in Las Vegas in the deadliest shooting by a lone assailant in modern US history.The dead in Sunday’s bloodshed ranged in age from 18 months to 77 years.Ten of the wounded in Texas remained in critical condition on Monday morning, officials said.Vice President Mike Pence said on Twitter that he will travel to Sutherland Springs on Wednesday to meet with victims’ families and law enforcement.The attack stunned Sutherland Springs, a community of about 400 people with just one blinking yellow traffic light.One family, the Holcombe, lost eight people from three generations in the attack, including Bryan Holcombe, an assistant pastor who was leading the service, a relative said.John Stiles, a 76-year-old retired US Navy veteran, said he heard the shots from his home about 150 yards (137 miles) away, “My wife and I were looking for a peaceful and quiet place when we moved here but now that hasn’t worked out.”"
1768,"BANGKOK: A solemn but colour-splashed procession streamed through Bangkok’s historic heart on Thursday as Thailand bade farewell to King Bhumibol Adulyadej in an elaborate, ritual-laden funeral that gripped a nation mourning the loss of its chief unifying figure.Some 300,000 black-clad mourners packed the streets from early Thursday, many weeping and prostrating themselves on the ground as a golden chariot carrying the royal urn slowly snaked through the blazing heat.Pipers, drummers and soldiers in a dazzling array of costumes joined Buddhist monks, Brahmin priests and the new King Maha Vajiralongkorn as the procession made its way to the spectacular funeral pyre.King Vajiralongkorn led royals, junta leaders and foreign dignitaries up the central tower to lay sandalwood flowers at the pyre ahead of the cremation, scheduled for 10pm (1500GMT), to a haunting accompaniment chanted by traditional singers.The $90 million funeral drew a ""Who’s Who"" of Thai power — royals, generals and establishment figures — as well as scores of foreign guests including Great Britian’s Prince Andrew and Japan’s Prince Akishino and Princess Akishino.For the public, the lavish affair was a chance to say a final goodbye to a monarch cherished as the ""father of the nation"".Bhumibol, who was crowned in 1950, towered over decades of Thai history before his death last October aged 88 seeded uncertainty in a country ruled by a divisive junta.A brew of palace propaganda and a harsh lese majeste law burnished the king’s reputation throughout his reign.But Bhumibol’s intimate connection with his subjects was on display Thursday.""He was perfect. He helped the country and Thai people so much. Seventy million Thai people are united in their love for him,"" said 65-year-old Wacharadej Tangboonlabkun, who like most Thais knew no other monarch before Bhumibol’s death.The death of a figure of constancy in a politically combustible country has dipped the kingdom into uncertainty.""There’s no more a father who only gave to his children,"" 47-year-old mourner Kingkan Kuntavee told AFP.For much of Bhumibol’s long reign, Thailand remained stuck on a carousel of violent protests, short-lived civilian governments and coups.Political turmoil threw up a supply of junta leaders and prime ministers, but all lacked Bhumibol’s moral capital with the Thai people.He left behind one of the world’s richest monarchies, one that stands at the apex of one of Southeast Asia’s most unequal societies.Deference towards the monarchy — and the social elites it underpins — is a given in Thailand.Ahead of the processions, palace aides shuffled on their knees in the presence of the new king, as monks in orange robes chanted Buddhist prayers.The new king, who wore full military regalia, will be crowned after his father is laid to rest.He has yet to win the same affection among the Thai public as his father, whose image was carefully curated by palace PR, cementing a reputation as austere, benevolent and incorruptible despite the fast-changing times.Thailand’s royal defamation law shields the monarchy from criticism and scrutiny, carrying 15-year jail sentences for each charge.That law makes independent analysis and frank public debate about the monarchy impossible inside Thailand.In effect it means the monarchy ""has monopolised the way the Thai public can think about its own political story,"" historian David Streckfuss told AFP.The ruling junta has jailed record numbers of people under the law since seizing power in a 2014 coup.Aged just 18 when he ascended the throne, the US-born Bhumibol became the fulcrum of the palace and was the world’s longest-reigning monarch until his death.The crown flourished with heavy US backing as Washington sought a bulwark against the spread of Communism across Southeast Asia.Thais have donned black for much of the last year in a remarkable outpouring of grief, which officially ends on October 30.They are expected to return to colourful clothes at the conclusion of the mourning period, which celebrates the king’s ascent to Mount Meru, the centre of the universe in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cosmology."
1769,"The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has released a database of around 13.4 million documents revealing over 25,000 companies owned by the world's rich and influential individuals.The ICIJ coordinated the Panama Papers investigation into offshore companies.The latest files have disclosed the financial details of politicians, corporations, and celebrities among others.The Paradise Papers comprise a major part of documents leaked from the company 'Appleby'.The documents — obtained by a German newspaper from two companies in Singapore and Bermuda — have made public the data of over 25,000 companies owned by individuals from 180 countries, from 1950 to 2016.Around 381 investigative journalists from 67 countries worked extensively to bring these facts before the people.Senior The News reporter and ICIJ member Umar Cheema was also part of the team that unearthed the Paradise Papers.In Pakistan, only Jang Group partners with the ICIJ.Pakistan's former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz was an employee of Citibank before becoming a politician. He was one of the shareholders and directors of Bahamas-registered Cititrust Limited from 1997 to 1999, along with other executives of the bank.In 1999 Aziz was appointed finance minister and created the Antarctic Trust.  Antarctic Trust set up by him whose beneficiaries include Aziz’s wife, their children and granddaughter.Aziz had set up the trust in Delaware (USA) before becoming finance minister. Interestingly, the trust was neither declared during his stint as finance minister nor as prime minister.Speaking through his attorney in New York, Shaukat Aziz said that he didn’t have to declare the trust in Pakistan as he was a settlor.When asked if his wife or children declared the trust, he responded that they didn’t have to declare because they were beneficiaries, not the beneficial owners.Aziz served as prime minister from August 28, 2004, to November 15, 2007 and was appointed as finance minister in 1999.Aziz settled abroad after his tenure came to an end in 2007.Moreover, former National Insurance Corporation Limited chairperson Ayaz Khan Niazi has also been identified in the records in connection with four offshore holdings in British Virgin Islands.One of them was a trust, Andalusian Discretionary Trust, while the other three were set up as companies: Andalusian Establishment Limited, Andalusian Enterprises Limited and Andalusian Holdings Limited.All the three companies were set up in 2010 when Niazi was the chairperson of National Insurance Corporation Limited.In the record, however, Niazi’s two brothers, Hussain Khan Niazi and Muhammad Ali Khan Niazi, were shown as the beneficial owners, whereas Ayaz along with his father Abdul Razaq Khan and mother Fauzia Razzaq acted as directors.Sadruddin Hashwani, a leading business magnate in the hoteling and oil industry, owns one company in Barbodas and Cayman Islands each. They are: Bowenergy Resources (Pakistan) SRL and Ocean Pakistan Ltd.Documents show the companies were used for securing hefty loans from Standard Chartered situated in yet another offshore jurisdiction, Mauritius, as well as its branch in London.The above two companies are in addition to a couple of other offshore holdings discovered through Panama Papers: North Atlantic Services Limited and Rushlake Hotels (USA) Inc., registered in British Virgin Islands.Responding to The News’ questions, Hashwani said he had answered in detail the last year (when the companies were identified in Panama Papers) and there is nothing to add in case of the two newly discovered companies. As for loans from Standard Chartered from its Mauritius branch is concerned, it was a business loan and the charge was registered in favour of the bank with the Security Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) hence nothing is hidden.Mian Muhammad Mansha, chairman of Nishat Group, has been linked with six offshore companies.

The offshore maneuvers may have avoided taxes in Canada, the United States and Israel, according to experts who reviewed some of the 3,000-plus files detailing the trust’s activities.As the offshore riches grew, lawyers for Bronfman, the Kolbers and other wealthy interests lobbied Canada’s Parliament to fight legislative proposals to tax income from offshore trusts.Bronfman remains a key fundraiser for Trudeau, who has championed openness in government and promised a crackdown on offshore tax dodging. In September, Trudeau told the UN General Assembly: “Right now, we have a system that encourages wealthy Canadians to use private corporations to pay a lower tax rate than middle-class Canadians. That’s not fair and we’re going to fix it.”The Appleby files show how Wilbur Ross, Trump’s commerce secretary, has used a chain of Cayman Islands entities to maintain a financial stake in Navigator Holdings, a shipping company whose top clients include the Kremlin-linked energy firm Sibur.

BAE Systems in 2010 settled a US Department of Justice bribery investigation and a separate British probe by pleading guilty to criminal charges and paying about $450 million in fines.Said responded that “Brian Mulroney did indeed sit on the board of my family investment company, Said Holdings Ltd. for the years you mention, and made a very valuable contribution to it. I am proud of the role I played in helping to secure the Al Yamamah program and with it many tens of thousands of well-paid and highly skilled jobs in the United Kingdom.”Yukio Hatoyama was Japan’s prime minister from 2009 to 2010.

Interestingly, the trust was neither declared to the tax and election authorities during his stint as finance minister nor as prime minister.Speaking through his attorney in New York, Aziz said that he didn’t have to declare the trust in Pakistan as he was a settlor.When asked if his wife or children declared the trust, he responded that they didn’t have to declare because they were beneficiaries, not the beneficial owners.Aziz served as prime minister from August 28, 2004, to November 15, 2007.Aziz settled abroad after his tenure came to an end in 2007.Moreover, former National Insurance Corporation Limited (NICL) chairperson Ayaz Khan Niazi has also been identified in the records in connection with four offshore holdings in the British Virgin Islands.One of them was a trust, Andalusian Discretionary Trust, while the other three were set up as companies: Andalusian Establishment Limited, Andalusian Enterprises Limited and Andalusian Holdings Limited.All the three companies were set up in 2010 when Niazi was the NICL chief. In the record, however, Niazi’s two brothers, Hussain Khan Niazi and Muhammad Ali Khan Niazi, were shown as the beneficial owners, whereas Ayaz along with his father Abdul Razaq Khan and mother Fauzia Razzaq acted as directors.The NICL scandal, which made headlines in Pakistan during Niazi's tenure, pertained to financial embezzlement by Niazi, then commerce minister (late) Makhdoom Amin Fahim and several bureaucrats in purchase of official land. The case is yet to be decided. Sadruddin Hashwani, a leading business magnate in the hoteling and oil industry, owns one company in Barbodas and Cayman Islands each.

Four of them are in British Virgin Islands: Mallen Securities Ltd, Maple Leaf Investments Ltd, Lyle Trading Ltd and Dolin International Limited.

1772,"Names of several Pakistanis, former prime minister Shaukat Aziz among them, have surfaced in the new database of documents, Paradise Papers, released by the International Consortium of Journalists Sunday night.The Paradise Papers reveal data of over 25,000 companies spanning 180 countries, from 1950 to 2016.Around 381 investigative journalists from 67 countries worked extensively to bring facts about the Paradise Papers before the people. Senior News reporter and ICIJ member Umar Cheema was also part of the team which unearthed the Paradise Papers.The leak, which includes 13.4 million documents, comprises a major part of documents leaked from company 'Appleby'. The documents were obtained from two companies in Singapore and Bermuda by a German newspaper and shared with the ICIJ.Also read: ICIJ releases another database revealing offshore companiesAccording to a report in The News, as many as 135 Pakistani individuals with accounts in a Swiss bank were also identified which they either created in their own name or through offshore companies. Some of the prominent individuals: Former PM Shaukat Aziz Aziz was an employee of Citibank before becoming Pakistan's finance minister and then prime minister in General (retd) Pervez Musharraf's government. He was one of the shareholders and directors of Bahamas-registered Cititrust Limited from 1997 to 1999, along with other executives of the bank.In 1999, Aziz was appointed finance minister and created the Antarctic Trust. The Antarctic Trust's beneficiaries include Aziz’s wife, their children and granddaughter.Aziz had set up the trust in Delaware (USA) before becoming finance minister. Interestingly, the trust was neither declared to the tax and election authorities during his stint as finance minister nor as prime minister.Speaking through his attorney in New York, Aziz said that he didn’t have to declare the trust in Pakistan as he was a settlor.When asked if his wife or children declared the trust, he responded that they didn’t have to declare because they were beneficiaries, not the beneficial owners.Aziz served as prime minister from August 28, 2004, to November 15, 2007.Aziz settled abroad after his tenure came to an end in 2007.Moreover, former National Insurance Corporation Limited (NICL) chairperson Ayaz Khan Niazi has also been identified in the records in connection with four offshore holdings in the British Virgin Islands.One of them was a trust, Andalusian Discretionary Trust, while the other three were set up as companies: Andalusian Establishment Limited, Andalusian Enterprises Limited and Andalusian Holdings Limited.All the three companies were set up in 2010 when Niazi was the NICL chief. In the record, however, Niazi’s two brothers, Hussain Khan Niazi and Muhammad Ali Khan Niazi, were shown as the beneficial owners, whereas Ayaz along with his father Abdul Razaq Khan and mother Fauzia Razzaq acted as directors.The NICL scandal, which made headlines in Pakistan during Niazi's tenure, pertained to financial embezzlement by Niazi, then commerce minister (late) Makhdoom Amin Fahim and several bureaucrats in purchase of official land. The case is yet to be decided. Sadruddin Hashwani, a leading business magnate in the hoteling and oil industry, owns one company in Barbodas and Cayman Islands each. They are: Bowenergy Resources (Pakistan) SRL and Ocean Pakistan Ltd.Documents show the companies were used for securing hefty loans from Standard Chartered situated in yet another offshore jurisdiction, Mauritius, as well as its branch in London.The above two companies are in addition to a couple of other offshore holdings discovered through Panama Papers: North Atlantic Services Limited and Rushlake Hotels (USA) Inc., registered in British Virgin Islands.Responding to The News’ questions, Hashwani said he had answered in detail the last year (when the companies were identified in Panama Papers) and there is nothing to add in case of the two newly discovered companies. As for loans from Standard Chartered from its Mauritius branch is concerned, it was a business loan and the charge was registered in favour of the bank with the Security Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) hence nothing is hidden.Mian Muhammad Mansha, chairman of Nishat Group, has been linked with six offshore companies. Four of them are in British Virgin Islands: Mallen Securities Ltd, Maple Leaf Investments Ltd, Lyle Trading Ltd and Dolin International Limited. The remaining two are in Mauritius: Croft Limited and Best Eagles Holdings Inc. An account in a Swiss bank has also been found connected with these companies which dates back to 1994 and was in existence till 2007.Responding to The News’ questions, Mansha said he had to move to the United States in the mid-1990s due to the adverse political situation in Pakistan. These bank accounts were meant to meet day-to-day living in that period. Finally, almost a decade ago, these accounts were liquidated and amounts repatriated to Pakistan through official channels and have been duly recorded in tax returns.Alauddin J Feerasta, chairman of Soneri Bank, is the owner of Rangeworth Limited, a company registered in British Virgin Island, having an account in a Swiss bank. Nooruddin Feerasta, his nephew and chairman of Rupali Polyester Limited, also has a company set up in British Virgins Island with an account in Swiss Bank. Both of them did not answer questions sent by The News.Disclaimer: It is pertinent to note here that not every offshore firm is necessarily illegal.With input from Umar Cheema of The News. "
